It mentions a class-action lawsuit filed against Tesla, arguing that the company did not commit fraud by failing to achieve its self-imposed deadlines. The lawsuit cites instances where Musk claimed that Tesla cars would be fully self-driving within a year or two due to software updates, as well as cases of crashes involving Tesla's driver assist technology. The article also highlights that Tesla's Autopilot system has been criticized for its performance compared to systems from other automakers. Despite the name 'Full Self Driving Capability,' the feature does not yet handle steering on city streets, and Tesla has missed its own predictions about when cars would be able to drive themselves. Tesla argues that the plaintiffs should have been aware of the system's limitations and that the suit should be dismissed for various reasons, including arbitration agreements and the plaintiffs' lack of harm."

"Specific_information": "Google's self-driving cars experienced 272 failures and 13 near misses between September 2014 and November 2015. These failures would have resulted in crashes if human test drivers had not intervened. The failures include technology issues such as communications breakdowns, sensor readings, and safety-critical system problems. Additionally, there were 341 disengagements, where either the cars unexpectedly handed control back to their test drivers or the drivers intervened themselves. Google reported that drivers took over 'many thousands of times' during this period, but only 69 incidents were reported as per California regulations. Google's software was used to determine if the driver's intervention was justified for safety. In some cases, disengagements were related to potential issues like traffic light perception, yielding to pedestrians and cyclists, and violations of traffic laws. The report suggests that self-driving cars might still require human drivers behind the wheel for safety."

In 424,000 miles of autonomous driving, there were 272 instances of 'disengagement,' where the human test driver had to take control of the vehicle due to autonomous technology failures. The report covers the period from September 24, 2014, to November 30, 2015, and it shows that disengagements occurred about every 785 miles in the fourth quarter of 2014, but a year later, it had expanded to 5,318 miles between episodes. Eighty-nine percent of disengagements happened on city streets, where driving conditions are more challenging. Google noted that they deliberately tested cars in various weather conditions and times of the day to gather data to refine the technology. There were also 69 episodes where the test driver chose to take control, with 13 instances where the cars would have hit objects if the driver hadn't intervened."

The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) revoked the permit due to violations on the driving records of active Pony.ai safety drivers. The DMV noted that Pony.ai had 41 autonomous test vehicles and 71 safety drivers on its permit. The revocation was immediate and attributed to the critical role of safety drivers in ensuring the safe testing of autonomous technology and the requirement for clean driving records as per DMV's regulations. This follows the suspension of Pony's driverless permit in November 2021 after a reported collision, which raised concerns about software defaults. While the DMV has not provided information about the status of the suspended driverless testing permit, the revocation of the permit requiring a driver to be present while testing makes it unlikely for the driverless permit to be reinstated anytime soon. The DMV can suspend or revoke permits in cases of unreasonable risk to public safety. Pony.ai has stated that it is reviewing the DMV's notice, and currently, the company does not hold any active testing permits in California. In contrast, in China, where most of Pony's operations are located, the company received a permit for driverless ride-hailing services on open roads in Beijing and obtained a taxi license to operate a commercial service in Guangzhou."

Uber was faulted for inadequate attention to safety and development decisions. The software in the modified Volvo XC90 did not properly identify Herzberg as a pedestrian. Uber had deactivated the automatic emergency braking system before the crash, relying on the backup driver to intervene. The crash raised significant safety concerns about the autonomous vehicle industry. Arizona's safety policies governing self-driving vehicles were also deemed 'insufficient' by regulators. Despite these issues, Vasquez is the only person facing criminal consequences in this case. Friends of the victim and some experts have criticized the handling of the case, suggesting that both Uber and the Arizona government should share responsibility."

"Specific_information": "The news is about British Airways parent company IAG warning of a hit to full-year profit due to a pilots' strike at British Airways and weaker sales by budget stablemates Vueling and Level. The strike in September grounded thousands of BA flights, and the company expects its recurring operating profit to fall by 215 million euros ($235 million) to 3.27 billion this year as a result. British Airways has also faced disruption from a third major computer failure in two years. Pilot unions have called off a second walk-out but said industrial action was likely to resume unless progress was made on a pay dispute. The strikes accounted for 137 million euros of the earnings hit, with further losses stemming from industrial action by Heathrow airport staff and weaker bookings at Vueling and Level."

"Specific_information": "The news is about a formal investigation by the U.S. government into Tesla's Autopilot system. The investigation covers 765,000 Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. since the 2014 model year. It was initiated due to a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles, resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality. The investigation focuses on 11 crashes since 2018 in which Teslas on Autopilot or Traffic Aware Cruise Control hit vehicles at scenes where first responders were using flashing lights, flares, illuminated arrow boards, or cones warning of hazards. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has also recommended that NHTSA and Tesla limit Autopilot's use to safe areas and improve systems to ensure driver attention. The probe is seen as a sign of increased focus on automated vehicle safety by NHTSA."

"Specific_information": "The news is about a fatal crash involving an autonomous Uber car and a pedestrian in Arizona. The incident occurred when the self-driving Uber car was in autonomous mode and struck a woman, Elaine Herzberg, who was walking outside of the crosswalk. Tragically, Ms. Herzberg later died at the hospital. The Uber CEO expressed condolences to the victim's family, and the company cooperated with local authorities in the investigation. The vehicle operator at the time of the crash was identified as Rafaela Vasquez, and there were no signs of impairment. The self-driving technology was supposed to detect pedestrians and prevent crashes. This incident has raised concerns about the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians, and it may lead to calls for tighter regulations in the industry."
