"Specific_information": "The news is about the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reviewing whether startup technology firm Pony.ai complied with government reporting requirements for driverless crashes. Pony.ai agreed to issue a recall for some versions of its autonomous driving system software after an October crash in California, which prompted the NHTSA to review the timeliness and accuracy of its reports. The incident involved a Pony.ai vehicle operating in autonomous mode hitting a street sign in Fremont, California. No one was injured in the incident. Pony.ai reported the incident to the NHTSA and cooperated with the agency throughout the process. The company also mentioned that the crash occurred less than 2.5 seconds after the automated driving system shut down and attributed it to a rare planning system diagnostic check 'false positive' indication of a geolocation mismatch. The NHTSA requested a recall, and Pony.ai updated the software code and repaired the affected vehicles. Additionally, Pony.ai recently completed a new round of financing with a valuation of $8.5 billion. California had previously registered 10 Hyundai Motor Kona electric vehicles under Pony.ai's driverless testing permit, and the suspension of Pony.ai's permit for driverless testing without a safety driver was mentioned."

"Specific_information": "The news is about concerns raised by the San Francisco fire chief, Jeanine Nicholson, regarding the deployment of self-driving taxis (robotaxis) in San Francisco. She has warned that these vehicles are 'not ready for primetime' due to multiple recent incidents of robotaxis obstructing fire engines and blocking roads during emergencies. The incidents include cars blocking one-way streets and firehouse driveways, forcing fire trucks to find alternate routes, and instances where robotaxis interfered with fire department work. There have been approximately 40 such incidents in 2023. One notable incident involved a Cruise robotaxi idling at the scene of a mass shooting, and another incident where a firefighter had to break the window of a Cruise vehicle to stop it from driving over hoses during a house fire. While no serious injuries have been reported, the fire chief is urging caution and improvements in the technology before further deployment in the city."

"Specific_information": "General Motors’ Cruise autonomous vehicle unit has agreed to cut its fleet of San Francisco robotaxis in half as authorities investigate two recent crashes in the city. The state department of motor vehicles (DMV) asked for the reduction after a Cruise vehicle without a human driver collided with an unspecified emergency vehicle on Thursday. On Thursday around 10pm, the Cruise vehicle had a green light, entered an intersection, and was hit by the emergency vehicle responding to a call. The robotaxi was carrying a passenger, who was taken by ambulance to a hospital with injuries that were not severe. Also on Thursday night, a Cruise car without a passenger collided with another vehicle in San Francisco. The Cruise rollout has not been all smooth sailing, with several traffic-related problems since the company launched its driverless ride-hailing service in San Francisco in June 2022. Other incidents have included a Cruise robotaxi idling in the middle of a mass shooting and a firefighter breaking the window of a Cruise vehicle to stop it. Cruise vehicles have driven more than 3 million autonomous miles in the city and have interacted with emergency vehicles more than 168,000 times in the first seven months of this year alone. The company will work with regulators and city departments to reduce the likelihood of a crash happening again."

    "Specific_information": "Waymo, a self-driving tech company, has reported 18 minor incidents involving its autonomous vehicles in the Phoenix area since 2019. These incidents occurred during tests and actual rides. Waymo aims to improve transparency by releasing safety data on their website and hopes it will contribute to industry-wide safety standards for self-driving cars. The data indicates that Waymo vehicles in Phoenix experienced minor incidents once every 339,000 miles and avoided 29 other incidents with the intervention of a safety driver, occurring once every 210,000 miles. Fortunately, none of these incidents, including those prevented, resulted in serious injuries. Waymo cars were rear-ended 11 times, but the data suggests that they were not rear-ended more frequently than human-driven vehicles in the area. Eight of the most significant incidents were attributed to human errors, while Waymo's technology successfully avoided incidents involving striking fixed objects or departing from the roadway, which are common incidents with human drivers that can lead to fatalities."

    "Specific_information": "Uber will not face criminal charges for a fatal crash involving one of its self-driving cars. Prosecutors have ruled that the company is not criminally liable for the death of Elaine Herzberg, 49, who was struck as she crossed a road in Tempe, Arizona. The car's back-up driver could still face criminal charges. A police report has previously called the incident 'entirely avoidable.' The crash occurred in March 2018 and involved a Volvo XC90 that Uber had been using to test its self-driving technology. Just before the crash, Ms. Herzberg had been walking with a bicycle across a poorly lit stretch of a multi-lane road. Dash-cam footage released by police after the incident appeared to show the vehicle's back-up driver, Rafaela Vasquez, taking her eyes off the road moments before the crash. Further records from the streaming service Hulu suggested that Ms. Vasquez had been streaming the TV show, The Voice, on a phone at the time of the crash. The Yavapai County Attorney's office recommended an expert analysis of the video, and that the Tempe police department collect further evidence on what the back-up driver would have seen on the road. The office did not explain its reasoning for finding Uber to be not criminally liable. The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the crash."

The Devbot vehicle crashed out of the Roborace competition after misjudging a corner while traveling at high speed. The incident occurred ahead of the start of the Formula E electric car race in Buenos Aires. Fortunately, no one was harmed, and the car can be repaired. The crash was attributed to the car's attempt to perform a maneuver and catch the edge of the barrier. Roborace's chief marketing officer mentioned that such incidents help them learn more about the computer's thinking and data. The Devbots are controlled by artificial intelligence software and use Lidar and other sensors for guidance and collision avoidance. Roborace plans to replace the Devbots with sleeker models in the future."

"Specific_information": "Google has patented a sticky coating for driverless cars that could reduce damage done to pedestrians in the event of a collision. People struck by the vehicle would become glued to its bonnet, rather than being thrown off and further injured. The adhesive layer would be hidden under a protective coating to ensure it did not gather debris during journeys. The patent explains that upon the initial impact between the colliding object and the vehicle, the coating is broken, exposing the adhesive layer. While there have been some minor collisions during Google's testing of driverless cars, the company's monthly reports suggest a majority of incidents are the fault of human drivers in other vehicles. Experts have differing opinions on whether the idea would work in practice, but it represents an innovative approach to pedestrian safety in driverless cars."

The crash resulted in the death of the driver, a fire, and the shutdown of two lanes of Highway 101. The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting an investigation to determine the cause of the crash. It is not clear if Tesla's automated control system, Autopilot, was active at the time of the crash. This investigation comes after a previous NTSB investigation into a 2016 accident involving Tesla's Autopilot system in Florida, where the NTSB partially faulted Tesla for the fatal crash, citing the driver's inattentiveness due to over-reliance on the Autopilot system."

"Specific_information": "Protesters in San Francisco have developed a novel way to protest against driverless cars by placing traffic cones on the hoods of these vehicles. This protest, led by Safe Street Rebel, aims to raise awareness of potential dangers associated with driverless taxis before a pivotal vote by the California public utilities commission on 13 July. The vote concerns allowing companies like Cruise and Waymo to charge people for rides as part of the state's driverless autonomous vehicles passenger service deployment program. The protest has gained attention on social media, with videos of driverless cars with cones on their hoods going viral. Waymo has criticized the protest, calling it vandalism and encouraging unsafe behavior on the road. Safe Street Rebel has a history of advocating for pedestrian safety and reducing the number of cars on the road, and it sees driverless cars as posing risks to safety and the environment. There have been incidents involving driverless cars blocking emergency vehicles and buses, as well as reports of collisions, including one in which a dog was struck and killed by a Waymo vehicle."
