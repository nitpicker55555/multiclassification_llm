On 14 February, the car, traveling at 2mph (3km/h), pulled out in front of a public bus going 15mph (24km/h). The human in the Google vehicle reported that he assumed the bus would slow down to let the car out, and so he did not override the car's self-driving computer. The crash happened in Mountain View, near Google's headquarters. In a statement, Google said: 'We clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a collision.'"

The incident resulted in nine people being treated for minor injuries, including one juvenile who was hospitalized. The California Highway Patrol traffic crash report obtained by CNN Business details the crash, stating that the Tesla Model S was traveling at about 55 mph, shifted into the far left-hand lane, and then braked abruptly, causing a chain reaction involving eight vehicles. Additionally, the news mentions that Tesla's driver-assist technologies, including 'full self-driving,' are already being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) due to reports of unexpected braking incidents, and NHTSA is considering a recall.

    "Specific_information": "The news article discusses a self-driving Uber SUV that struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. The autonomous vehicle detected the pedestrian about six seconds before the collision but did not apply the brakes because the system designed for emergency braking in potentially dangerous situations had been disabled. Instead, Uber relied on a human backup driver to intervene, but the system was not designed to alert the driver. The report highlights the absence of automatic braking during computer-controlled operation, which is a critical aspect of self-driving car safety. It also mentions the driver's delayed response in steering and braking, as well as the fact that Uber had suspended testing of its self-driving vehicles in multiple locations following the crash. The news provides insight into the circumstances of the crash and the safety concerns surrounding self-driving car technology."

"Details": "In the news article, it is reported that a self-driving Lexus RX450h, owned by Alphabet Inc's Google, was involved in a minor crash with a municipal bus in Mountain View, California. The self-driving car attempted to get around some sandbags in a wide lane, traveling at less than 2 miles per hour, while the bus was moving at about 15 miles per hour. The self-driving car and its test driver believed that the bus would slow down or allow the autonomous vehicle to merge into traffic. However, three seconds later, as the self-driving car re-entered the center of the lane, it collided with the bus, causing damage to the left front fender, front wheel, and a driver-side sensor. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported. Google acknowledged responsibility for the collision, stating that if their car hadn't moved, the collision wouldn't have occurred. They also mentioned making software refinements to better handle situations involving buses and large vehicles."

According to the study mentioned in the article, self-driving cars are likely only capable of preventing a third of all U.S. road crashes. The study conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found that self-driving systems cannot handle certain types of crashes any better than human drivers, particularly those caused by factors such as making wrong assumptions about other road users' actions, driving too fast or too slow for road conditions, or making incorrect evasive maneuvers. The study also found that one-third of all crashes were the exclusive result of sensing and perception errors or driver incapacitation. This information demonstrates that self-driving cars may not be as effective in preventing crashes as initially hoped."

"Specific_information": "The news is about a Waymo self-driving car that was involved in an accident in San Francisco where it struck and killed a small dog. The incident report states that the collision was unavoidable, even though the vehicle's autonomous system correctly identified the dog. The human safety operator in the driver's seat did not see the dog, but the autonomous system did. However, due to the dog's high-speed and unusual path, neither the safety operator nor the autonomous system braked to avoid the collision. Waymo confirmed that they are investigating the incident, and the public perception of self-driving cars is a crucial concern in such cases, as it can impact the industry's expansion plans. Additionally, regulatory bodies like the National Highway Traffic Association (NHTSA) may launch investigations into such incidents, although NHTSA has not initiated an investigation at the time of this news."

The accidents did not result in any injuries or serious damage, according to the GM reports, but did demonstrate the challenges for developers of self-driving cars confronted by crowded urban streets. Most of the crashes involved drivers of other vehicles striking the GM cars that were slowing for stop signs, pedestrian or other issues. In one crash, a driver of a Ford Ranger was on his cell phone when he rear-ended a Chevrolet Bolt that was stopped at a red light. In another instance, the driver of a Chevrolet Bolt noticed an intoxicated cyclist in San Francisco going the wrong direction toward the Bolt. The human driver stopped the Bolt and the cyclist hit the bumper and fell over. The bicyclist pulled on a sensor attached to the vehicle causing minor damage. In another incident on Sept. 15 in San Francisco, a Dodge Charger in the left-turn lane attempted to illegally pass a Bolt in driverless mode. The GM Cruise employee took control of the vehicle and the Dodge scraped the front sensor and fled the scene without stopping."

The Uber Technologies car – a Volvo SUV – was carrying two engineers in the front and no backseat passengers but it is not yet clear whether the car was in self-driving mode at the time of the crash. Initial police reports suggest the collision was caused by a person who failed to give way to the self-driving car rather than a malfunction by the Uber vehicle. However, pending further investigation, the company has removed all its self-driving cars from the road in Arizona, as well as test sites in Pennsylvania and California – all three states where it operated the driverless vehicles. A spokesperson for the police in Tempe, Arizona, said the crash happened when another car 'failed to yield' to an Uber car at a left turn. Josie Montenegro said: 'There was a person behind the wheel. It is uncertain at this time if they were controlling the vehicle at the time of the collision.' Uber self-driving cars always have a human in the driving seat who can take over the controls."

Based on the provided news article, it is not directly about self-driving car crashes. Instead, the news discusses General Motors (GM) facing pushback on its request for waivers on certain automobile safety standards to deploy a ride-sharing fleet of driverless cars. The key points in the article are:
General Motors (GM) requested a temporary waiver on features like mirrors, dashboard warning lights, and turn signals designed for a human driver to deploy a driverless ride-sharing fleet.
Various groups, including car dealers, insurers, and safety organizations, raised concerns about this request.
Some organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the National Federation of the Blind support GM's plan, believing that autonomous vehicles could reduce the toll from car crashes.
The Union of Concerned Scientists called for more data on how GM's self-driving cars with backup safety drivers are performing and expressed concerns about the behavior of these vehicles in certain situations.
NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) is seeking public comments on the removal of regulatory barriers for automated driving systems.
While the news discusses autonomous vehicles and safety standards, it does not specifically mention self-driving car crashes. Therefore, the news is not directly relevant to self-driving car crashes.

    "Specific_information": "A self-driving test car from Ford-backed startup Argo was involved in an accident on Wednesday that sent two people to the hospital. The car, a modified Ford Fusion, was struck by a box van running a red light in the East Allegheny area of Pittsburgh. The collision smashed in the doors on the passenger side and blew out the back window. Two of the four occupants of the vehicle were injured and transported to the hospital in a stable condition before being released later on Wednesday. It is not yet known whether charges will be filed against the driver of the box van, or whether the Argo car was in self-driving mode at the time of the accident."
