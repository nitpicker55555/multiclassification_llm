"Description": "An Uber self-driving test car which killed a woman crossing the street detected her but decided not to react immediately, a report has said. The car was travelling at 40mph (64km/h) in self-driving mode when it collided with 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg at about 10pm on 18 March. Herzberg was pushing a bicycle across the road outside of a crossing. She later died from her injuries. Although the car’s sensors detected Herzberg, its software which decides how it should react was tuned too far in favour of ignoring objects in its path which might be 'false positives' (such as plastic bags), according to a report from the Information. This meant the modified Volvo XC90 did not react fast enough. The report also said the human safety driver was not paying close enough attention to intervene before the vehicle struck the pedestrian. Arizona suspended Uber’s self-driving vehicle testing after the incident. The company later settled with Herzberg’s family. Uber and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the incident. Uber has already reached its preliminary conclusion, according to the report.

"Summary": "A distracted safety operator in an Uber self-driving car was primarily to blame for a fatal crash in 2018, according to a ruling by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB also cited an 'inadequate safety culture' at Uber and poor rules governing self-driving technology testing as contributing factors. The crash occurred on 18 March 2018 when an Uber-owned self-driving car struck and killed Elaine Herzberg, who was crossing a road in Tempe, Arizona. The safety driver in the car had been distracted, streaming a TV show on her mobile phone while behind the wheel. The NTSB found that if the operator had been attentive, the crash might have been avoided. Uber's computers detected Ms. Herzberg but did not correctly identify her as a person. The NTSB also noted that Ms. Herzberg was acting unsafely by attempting to cross the road where she did, possibly impaired by drugs. Uber acknowledged its 'inadequate safety culture' and welcomed the NTSB's recommendations."

Tesla's driver assistant features, described as 'Autopilot' or 'full self-driving,' are under scrutiny due to a series of accidents and videos of Tesla cars driving with no one in the driver's seat. Tesla charges $10,000 for its semi-automated features under its full self-driving (FSD) software. While Tesla claims on its website that the features do not make the vehicle autonomous, CEO Elon Musk often uses the term FSD. Consumer groups and experts have criticized Tesla for misleading consumers and contributing to fatal accidents. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is reviewing the matter, and a violation of the rule could lead to sanctions against Tesla."

Officials announced earlier this week that Uber won’t face criminal charges in the death of a pedestrian struck and killed by one of its self-driving cars nearly a year ago in Tempe, Arizona. The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office said it conducted a thorough review of the evidence and determined there was no basis for criminal liability against Uber. It did not detail how the decision was made and has declined to answer any questions on the case. The pedestrian was walking a bicycle across a road at night. Uber’s self-driving software system initially classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, then as a vehicle, then as a bicycle, but never braked. However, the Uber employee who was behind the wheel of the SUV could still face criminal charges. Companies working on self-driving cars, such as Uber, have test drivers who are supposed to intervene if the car fails to act properly. It’s not clear why the prosecutor’s office made its decision — if it is because Uber bore no responsibility or that there was no law under which the company could be charged. That means a first chance for the industry, legal experts and society to discuss this issue may have been lost. And it’s a discussion that needs to be had because it’s a hard problem to solve...",

    "Specific_information": "A driverless car was involved in a traffic accident on a California city street earlier this year. No one was hurt in the small fender bender, but the accident does signal we are making incredible leaps forward on the road toward driverless cars. It may sound counterintuitive, but this crash shows just how far autonomous technology has come in such a short time. This wasn’t really an accident in the traditional sense — intentional software changes implemented just weeks earlier were likely a contributing factor. With any luck, we will continue to accelerate real-world experimentation and the possibility of more accidents to come. The incident was partially caused by a subtle software update, implemented a few weeks prior in all of Google’s autonomous cars, that enabled them to “hug the rightmost side of the lane,” a common social norm that allows other drivers to pass on the left. According to the accident report, the Google autonomous vehicle was shifting within its lane to bypass an obstacle in its path when it made contact with a bus approaching from behind. The car was traveling slower than two miles per hour at the time of impact — the bus, about 15 mph. The fact that Google was testing this new behavior to hug the right side of the lane shows that the technology has developed beyond simply following the rules of the road, but actually driving more “human like” — in line with the social elements of driving. Accidents like this are vital learning exercises. Google’s driverless vehicles cover more than 10,000 miles a day, in addition to the three million miles of computer-simulated driving taking place daily. But these real-life tests are crucial."

    "Title": "Tesla recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles equipped with ‘Full Self-Driving’",
    "Summary": "Tesla is recalling all 363,000 US vehicles with its so-called “Full Self Driving” driver assist software due to safety risks. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that Tesla’s FSD feature led to an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety, citing issues with the system's behavior at intersections. Tesla plans to address the issue through an over-the-air software update. There have been 18 reports of incidents related to these conditions, but no reported injuries or deaths. The recall affects all four Tesla models. NHTSA has identified at least 273 crashes involving Tesla’s driver assist systems. The safety claims for FSD have been a subject of debate, and NHTSA is also investigating Tesla's predecessor, Autopilot. Tesla has faced legal scrutiny and criticism for missed deadlines related to self-driving promises."
