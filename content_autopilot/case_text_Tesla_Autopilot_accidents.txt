The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating a crash involving a 2022 Tesla Model S that may have been operating in Autopilot during the accident, which resulted in the tragic death of three people. This incident occurred in Newport Beach, California, when the Tesla hit a curb and slammed into construction equipment, totaling the car. The NHTSA is currently investigating more than 30 crashes, all of which potentially involved Autopilot. Out of the 35 special crash investigations into Tesla since 2016 related to the company's advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot has been ruled out only in three cases. Additionally, a total of 14 crash deaths have been reported in these investigations. This news highlights ongoing concerns about the safety and effectiveness of Tesla's Autopilot system, as well as the potential for driver misinterpretation of the system's capabilities, despite Tesla's warnings that it requires active driver supervision and is not fully autonomous."

  "Specific_information": "The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has found that Tesla's Autopilot system was partly to blame for a fatal accident in which a Model S collided with a lorry. Federal investigators say Tesla 'lacked understanding' of the semi-autonomous Autopilot's limitations. The NTSB recommended that car manufacturers and regulators take steps to ensure such systems are not misused. It said the collision should never have happened. The crash, in May 2016, led to the death of Tesla driver Joshua Brown, 40. 'In this crash, Tesla's system worked as designed, but it was designed to perform limited tasks in a limited range of environments,' Christopher Hart, a member of the NTSB said in a meeting to discuss the findings of its investigation. 'Tesla allowed the driver to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed, and the system gave far more leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than driving.' The NTSB found that both Mr. Brown and the lorry driver had sufficient sight distance to afford time for either party to have acted to prevent the collision. The investigation found that Mr. Brown's inattention and the lorry driver's unwillingness to give way were both primary factors of the crash. Following the meeting, the NTSB's report included seven safety recommendations requiring car manufacturers to add safeguards to prevent automated vehicle control systems from being used outside the conditions for which they were designed."

A Tesla Model 3 and Subaru Impreza collided head-on during the evening of July 5, according to state police, and the driver of the Subaru died a short time later. Local media reports say that an infant that had been traveling in the Tesla died last week. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been looking into a string of accidents involving Teslas that are believed to have had automated driving technology installed. The NHTSA last sent investigators to a March 15 crash in Halifax County, North Carolina, that injured a 17-year-old student. The State Highway Patrol said at the time that the driver of the 2022 Tesla Model Y, a 51-year-old male, failed to stop for the bus, which was displaying all of its activated warning devices. Sending special investigation teams to crashes means that the agency suspects the Teslas were operating systems that can handle some aspects of driving, including Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving.” Despite the names used for the technology, Tesla says these are driver-assist systems and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. The NHTSA has sent investigative teams to at least 30 crashes since 2016 involving Teslas suspected of using partially automated driving systems. At least 16 people have died in the crashes."

  "Specific_information": "The news is relevant to Tesla Autopilot accidents because it discusses a German court ruling that found Tesla's claims about its Autopilot driver-assist feature to be misleading. The court stated that the use of the term 'autopilot' and other marketing material suggested that the vehicle could drive on its own, but in reality, the technology still requires the driver to remain alert at all times. Tesla has been banned from repeating these misleading claims. Additionally, the article mentions instances of drivers misusing the Autopilot system, including a British driver who climbed into the passenger seat on the motorway while the system was active and a Tesla driver who was playing a video game when his Autopilot-enabled car crashed into a concrete barrier, highlighting the potential dangers associated with the feature."

"Specific_information": "This news is about a Tesla car that was driving in 'autopilot' mode when it crashed into a stopped firetruck in Utah. Tesla confirmed that the vehicle's technology failed to prevent the collision, and the company repeatedly cast blame on the driver, not its semi-autonomous driving system. The driver had turned on the 'autosteer' and 'cruise control' features about 80 seconds before the crash, took her hands off the wheel, and was looking at her phone before the collision. Tesla's report mentioned instances where the driver took her hands off the wheel for more than one minute at a time. The car was traveling at 60 miles per hour when the crash happened, and the driver manually pressed the vehicle brake fractions of a second before the collision. The spokesperson for Tesla stated that the crash occurred because the driver did not pay attention to the road at all times, and Autopilot is not intended for use without a fully attentive driver. This news report provides detailed information about a Tesla Autopilot-related accident."
