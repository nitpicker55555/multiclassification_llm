The incident started in November 2013 and lasted until mid-April, resulting from a cloud system being set to public instead of private. The exposed data could include details such as vehicle locations and identification numbers of vehicle devices. Toyota stated that there were no reports of malicious use. The company plans to introduce a system to audit cloud settings, establish continuous monitoring systems, and provide thorough employee education on data handling rules. The affected customers were those who signed up for services like T-Connect, which offers AI voice-enabled driving assistance and emergency support, and G-Link, a similar service for Lexus owners. Japan's Personal Information Protection Commission has been informed about the incident, and steps have been taken to block outside access to the data. An investigation into all cloud environments managed by Toyota Connected Corp is ongoing."

The act would make carmakers responsible for self-driving errors and introduce sanctions for companies if anything goes wrong when their vehicles take over control from human drivers. It also emphasizes that once a self-driving system is engaged, the person in the driving seat would no longer be responsible for how the car drives, and instead, the company or body that obtained authorization would face regulatory sanctions if anything goes wrong.

This price increase marks a significant jump from the initial cost of $3,000 when it was first introduced as an add-on. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had previously stated that the price of 'full self-driving' would increase periodically as it develops and approaches regulatory approval, with a potential value of over $100,000. However, Tesla has not received regulatory approval for 'full self-driving' yet. The California DMV has criticized the name 'full self-driving' as deceptive, and the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating Tesla's Autopilot technology. 'Full self-driving' currently requires a human driver to be ready to take control as it can make judgment errors while navigating local roads."

The crash occurred when a test driver and safety engineer tried to reenter autonomous driving mode before the system computer was primed to do so, causing the truck to swerve and collide with a highway barrier. The crash did not result in injuries but caused some minor damage to the truck. TuSimple grounded its fleet and conducted an investigation, which revealed that an outdated command was responsible for the abrupt swerve. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University pointed out that common safeguards were lacking, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration initiated an investigation. TuSimple has since upgraded its systems to prevent similar errors. The news also mentions TuSimple's financial performance and plans for commercializing driver-out operations."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that Uber had disabled an emergency braking system in the self-driving vehicle that struck and killed a pedestrian. The report also mentioned that the self-driving system software initially classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, then as a vehicle, and finally as a bicycle. At 1.3 seconds before impact, the self-driving system determined that emergency braking was needed, but Uber had disabled automatic emergency braking maneuvers in the vehicle to 'reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.' The report revealed that the safety operator behind the wheel was not looking at the road moments before the crash, and the self-driving system did not alert the operator. The report noted that the Uber vehicle required operator intervention but was not designed to alert the operator. The operator engaged the steering wheel less than a second before impact and began braking less than a second after impact. Additionally, the report mentioned that the pedestrian had tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana and did not look in the direction of the vehicle until just before impact. The news also highlighted Uber's decision to end testing in Arizona and focus on limited testing in other locations, as well as the reaction of various cities and organizations regarding the safety of self-driving technology."
