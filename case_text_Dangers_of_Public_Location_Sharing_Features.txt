"Specific_information": "The news is relevant to location information leakage. The Pentagon has restricted the use of geolocation features on smartphones, fitness trackers, and other devices for U.S. military personnel due to security risks associated with revealing their location. This decision was prompted by an Australian researcher's analysis of data from the fitness tracking app Strava, which revealed the locations of American forces in Syria and Iraq. The Pentagon's memo stated that these geolocation capabilities could expose personal information, locations, routines, and numbers of Department personnel, posing a significant risk to security and the mission. The ban on using geolocation features on government and non-government-issued devices in operational areas is effective immediately."
