"Specific_information": "The news is relevant to Geographic ethical education. David Smith, who passed away at the age of 85, was a professor of geography at Queen Mary University of London and authored 21 books primarily focusing on the intersection between human geography, ethics, and moral philosophy. His work included compelling case studies from various regions, such as South Africa, Palestine, Australia, the former Soviet Union, and eastern Europe, examining the geographical causes of inequality and social injustice. It also explored potential solutions to these issues. David Smith's contributions to geography and social justice, particularly through his books 'Geography and Social Justice (1994)' and 'Moral Geographies: Ethics in a World of Difference (2000),' demonstrate his commitment to integrating human geography and moral philosophy for politically relevant dialogue."

"Specific_information": "Geography teaching in English schools has been criticized as 'mediocre' by government inspectors. The report highlights that children are not learning about climate change or eco-sustainability, and there has been a significant decline in the number of children studying geography at the upper levels of secondary education. In primary schools, the achievement of pupils and the quality of teaching in geography are weaker than in other subjects. The report also notes that many primary teachers lack confidence in teaching geography and have limited opportunities to improve their knowledge in this area. Additionally, the global dimension of geography education is underdeveloped in most schools, with insufficient connections made between the wider curriculum and the geography curriculum to reinforce pupils' understanding of global citizenship, diversity, human rights, and sustainable development. The quality of teaching and learning in Key Stage 3 (the first years of secondary school) is criticized as mediocre, often due to the allocation of non-specialists to teach geography. Many schools surveyed fail to provide required geography field trips, citing concerns about health and safety, curriculum time, expertise, and budgets. The government has stated that it is taking steps to address these issues, including better training and support for teachers, a new Key Stage 3 curriculum, and a pilot GCSE program."

They will no longer ask pupils to explain the 'positive' effects of climate change, such as 'increased tourism to more northerly latitudes' and 'improved crop yields.'

The SQA recognizes the importance of reflecting the climate emergency and has worked with experienced geography teachers to update the curriculum. Pupils will now focus on short and long-term impacts in different parts of the world without encouraging 'equal consideration' of environmental and economic impacts. Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens' education spokesman, welcomed these changes as young people seek the skills and knowledge needed to address the climate crisis."
