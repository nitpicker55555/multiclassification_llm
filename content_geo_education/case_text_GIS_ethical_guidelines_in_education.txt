The groups argue that KLM adverts and their carbon-offsetting scheme create the false impression that its flights won't make climate change worse. They are taking aim at the company's Fly Responsibly campaign, which was launched in 2019 and declared the airline is 'creating a more sustainable future' and is on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. The environmental groups call the advertising campaign 'greenwashing' and claim products like CO2Zero do nothing to limit damage to the environment. If the case is successful, KLM will have to withdraw the advertising, stop any similar advertising in the future, and issue corrections."

"Specific_information": "Japan is in negotiations with several Eastern European countries, including Russia and Poland, for emissions trading based on the Kyoto Protocol. It appears that Japan is on the verge of reaching a basic agreement with multiple countries, marking the first such agreement, with a final agreement possible as early as this fiscal year. However, negotiations with Hungary have stalled due to disagreements over pricing, and Japan intends to suspend these negotiations. Japan plans to utilize not only emissions trading but also other Kyoto mechanisms to achieve its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. Under the Kyoto Protocol, Japan's emission reduction target is 6% below 1990 levels. To achieve this, Japan has been negotiating with Eastern European countries, which have surplus emissions rights that can be sold as offsets for Japan's emissions. Japan's goal is to acquire 100 million tons of emission rights over the five years from 2008 to 2012. The emissions trading agreement that Japan is likely to reach with several Eastern European countries is related to the 'Green Investment Scheme' (GIS), which is a mechanism associated with emissions trading and specific environmental measures. So far, only two cases of emission trading through this mechanism have been established, where Hungary sold 6 million tons of emission rights to Spain and Belgium, with Hungary announcing a significant deal on November 13th. Eastern European countries have surplus emissions rights, particularly in the former Soviet Union. Japan's negotiation partners include Russia, Latvia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Poland, Belarus, and approximately 10 other countries, with Japan aiming to reach a basic agreement within the next few weeks. Regarding negotiations with Hungary, which began in December 2007, Japan had agreed to directly purchase emission rights from Hungary to meet the emission reduction targets set by the Kyoto Protocol. Hungary had plans to sell 10 million tons of emission rights in 2008, and negotiations were ongoing regarding the quantity and price. However, due to Hungary's stance on pricing, the negotiations have become challenging, and Japan is considering suspending them. Emissions trading involves individual government-level negotiations, and prices and quantities are typically not disclosed. However, Japan believes that the prices should be lower than those in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), based on concerns about whether the environmental measures imposed on the country selling emission rights are appropriate. CDM credit prices, based on the CDM, are trading at around 13-14 euros per ton on the secondary market within the European Union (EU)."

"Specific_information": "The news is about the closure of the Gender Identity Development Service for Children and Adolescents (GIDS) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS trust in London. The closure has been met with both support and criticism, with concerns raised about the overdiagnosis of gender dysphoria, early medical interventions, and the increase in referrals, particularly among girls. The controversy includes a legal case involving a former patient, Keira Bell, whose initial win was later overturned. A review led by Hilary Cass recommended the creation of regional hubs to address the overwhelming demand for gender identity services. Patients have been assured of a smooth transition to early adopter hubs in London and Manchester, with concerns about access to hormone treatment and the need for formal research participation. The impact on young people and their families, who often resort to private treatment due to long waiting lists, remains a significant concern."
