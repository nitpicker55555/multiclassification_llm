    "Specific_information": "Google has agreed to pay a $13 million settlement that could resolve a class-action lawsuit over the company’s collection of people’s private information through its Street View project. The legal action began when several people whose data was collected sued Google after it admitted the cars photographing neighborhoods for Street View had also gathered emails, passwords and other private information from wifi networks in more than 30 countries. Investigators found that Google engineers intentionally intercepted the data from 2007 to 2010, according to court documents. This settlement includes provisions for Google to destroy any remaining data collected via Street View, agree not to use Street View to collect data from wifi networks except with consent, and create webpages and videos teaching people how to secure their wireless data. The agreement also includes monetary relief for the 22 original plaintiffs and a donation to organizations dedicated to data privacy and consumer protection. The settlement notes that Google denies any wrongdoing."
