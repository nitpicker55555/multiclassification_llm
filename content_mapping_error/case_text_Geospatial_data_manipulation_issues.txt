"Specific_information": "This news is relevant to Geospatial data manipulation issues because it discusses the need for open access to Ordnance Survey (OS) mapping data and the potential for manipulation of geospatial data. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, advocates for making basic, raw data from Ordnance Survey available online to build a 'semantic web' and enable the processing of relevant data by computers. He emphasizes the importance of using standard formats for geospatial data. The article also mentions OS considering opening access to data through applications programming interfaces (APIs) for non-commercial use. Additionally, it discusses issues related to OS's licensing of geographical data and potential changes required to promote fair access and encourage data reuse."

"Specific_information": "This news is relevant to Geospatial data manipulation issues because Google, in partnership with the United Nations, is using vast quantities of raw satellite imagery and data to create geospatial maps and data for an online platform. The platform aims to show how water ecosystems, including rivers and forests, have changed over time. It can also display where water has disappeared, where it now exists, and where it is seasonal. The use of artificial intelligence and cloud computing to process decades of satellite imagery and data is a clear indication of geospatial data manipulation. This initiative has the potential to provide valuable insights into water resource management, environmental changes, and support the Sustainable Development Goals related to water and sanitation."

Rebekah Jones, a former leading COVID-19 data scientist in the state, claimed to have evidence that employees at Florida’s department of health were instructed to change numbers and begin deleting deaths and cases to make it appear as though Florida's COVID-19 situation was improving. Jones also created her own privately-funded rival COVID-19 database for Florida, which expanded official state figures in several key areas, including the number of cases and deaths. This highlights a potential manipulation of geospatial data to influence the perception of the pandemic's impact in the state."
