"Specific_information": "The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information. NASA's Voyager 2 probe experienced a loss of contact due to a faulty command that resulted in the antenna pointing two degrees away from Earth. While this may not be directly related to maps, it involves issues with precise positioning and orientation in space, which is a form of geographical information. Efforts are being made to re-establish contact with Voyager 2, which is currently more than 12 billion miles from Earth."

"Specific_information": "This news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information because it discusses a software mistake in Tui's reservation system that led to the misclassification of passengers based on their titles, resulting in incorrect weight calculations for a flight departing from Birmingham airport to Majorca. The error in the IT system, which assigned child's weight to female passengers with the title 'Miss' instead of the adult weight, caused the load sheet for the aircraft to inaccurately state its weight. While the news highlights that the safe operation of the aircraft was not compromised, it clearly involves issues related to geographical information and flight operations."
