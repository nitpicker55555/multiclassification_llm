Google found itself in the cross-hairs of privacy officials in several countries last year after admitting that cars used to take images for its Street View mapping service were also collecting personal information from unsecured home wireless networks as they drove by. Stoddart said that Google had collected complete e-mails, e-mail addresses, user names and passwords, names, home telephone numbers and addresses, and even the names of people suffering from certain medical conditions. The investigation concluded the breach was largely due to Google’s lack of proper privacy policies and procedures. Google has begun to delete the data collected in Canada, a process complicated by U.S. and Canadian regulations. It said the data will be secured and not used until it can be destroyed."
