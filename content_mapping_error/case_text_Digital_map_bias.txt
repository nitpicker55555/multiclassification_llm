The switch aims to correct the distortion present in traditional maps, such as the Mercator projection, which exaggerates the size of certain countries and continents. The article discusses how the introduction of the Peters projection has changed students' perceptions of the world's geography, with Africa and South America appearing larger and the USA and Europe appearing smaller. The decision to adopt the Peters projection is part of a broader effort by Boston public schools to decolonize the curriculum and present a more accurate representation of the world to students. It also mentions the controversy and debate surrounding the choice between Mercator and Peters maps, with proponents of the Peters projection arguing that the Mercator projection has perpetuated European imperialist attitudes."

The U.S. Supreme Court has reinstated a Republican-drawn map of Louisiana's six U.S. House of Representatives districts that had been blocked by a judge who found that it likely discriminates against Black voters. The judge's injunction required a new map with a second district where Black voters represent the majority of voters, but the Republican-led state legislature had adopted a version with only one such district. The decision by the Supreme Court is seen as a setback for Democrats as they try to retain control of Congress in November's elections. The case involves allegations that the map packs large numbers of Black voters into a single district while dispersing the rest into five others where they are too few to elect their preferred candidates. This case is part of a larger debate about the impact of gerrymandering and racial bias in electoral maps, and it raises questions about the Voting Rights Act and the equal protection under the law guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment."

        "Summary": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a bid by South Carolina officials to revive a Republican-crafted voting map that a lower court said had unconstitutionally 'exiled' 30,000 Black voters from a closely contested congressional district. The lower court found that the Republican-drawn map deliberately split up Black neighborhoods in Charleston County in a 'stark racial gerrymander' and ordered the district to be redrawn. Gerrymandering is a practice involving the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to marginalize a certain set of voters and increase the influence of others. In this case, the Republican legislators were accused of racial gerrymandering to reduce the influence of Black voters. The Supreme Court will hear the case in its next term, which begins in October."

"Summary": "The US government’s new mobile app for migrants to apply for asylum at the US-Mexico border is blocking many Black people from being able to file their claims because of facial recognition bias in the tech, immigration advocates say. Non-profits that assist Black asylum seekers are finding that the app, CBP One, is failing to register many people with darker skin tones, effectively barring them from their right to request entry into the US. Black asylum seekers from Haiti and African countries are particularly affected. The facial recognition technology is not picking up images of people with darker skin tones, preventing them from applying for asylum appointments. This issue has also affected Venezuelans with darker skin tones. Advocates are trying to find workarounds, such as using bright construction lights for photos, but the problem persists, especially for children under the age of six. The CBP One app is seen as the only hope for many migrants to cross the border, but it presents significant barriers for Black asylum seekers."

The Court found that the state violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act, as the map diluted the voting power of Black Alabamians by featuring only one majority-Black district out of seven, despite Black people comprising 27% of Alabama's population. The Court ordered Alabama to configure a second House district where Black voters could hold a 'voting-age majority or something quite close to it.' This ruling is expected to impact the congressional map for the 2024 elections and may have implications for the balance of power in the House of Representatives.

TomTom has amassed extensive data on maps and driving conditions, totaling 1 trillion data points, which can improve navigation and be used for new products. Within six months of the takeover closing, Tele Atlas plans to launch a new generation of products that include maps carrying TomTom's data on driving conditions. The acquisition also opens new opportunities for Tele Atlas' geographical information services business, expanding its services to governments, utility companies, planners, and fleet managers. Despite a weak first quarter, De Taeye believes the market for car navigation devices is far from saturation, with potential saturation levels beyond 50 percent in markets like Japan."

The Supreme Court's decision, authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, upheld the role of state courts and state constitutions in regulating federal elections. However, it still allows federal courts to second-guess state courts in certain election-related cases. The ruling was supported by a combination of conservative and liberal justices, with some dissenting conservative justices.

Researchers, including Simon Haslett from Swansea University and David Willis from the University of Oxford, have found evidence on a medieval map, known as the Gough map, which suggests the existence of two islands off the Ceredigion coast. The Gough map is believed to date back to the mid-13th century and is considered the earliest complete map of the British Isles. These islands, depicted on the map, are located offshore between Aberystwyth and Aberdyfi and farther north towards Barmouth, Gwynedd. The discovery has led to speculation that the legend of Cantre’r Gwaelod may have a historical basis, and it is supported by coordinates recorded by the Roman cartographer Ptolemy, suggesting the coastline was different in the past. This finding could have implications for understanding the history and geography of the region."

"Specific_information": "The news discusses a brain scan developed by American scientists that can detect racial prejudice in racially biased white individuals. The researchers observed increased brain activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when these individuals viewed photographs of black faces, suggesting suppressed prejudice. The study also mentioned controversy surrounding its conclusions, with some experts cautioning against drawing strong inferences from the results. The research suggests that the brain activity stems from an inner struggle not to express offensive thoughts or behavior, which can lead to mental exhaustion. However, it is worth noting that the study does not establish a direct link between implicit bias detected by brain scans and actual behavior towards people of other races. Some experts believe that the study's findings are inconclusive and emphasize the complexity of interpreting brain activity in real-life social contexts."

"Title": "Imprisoned by algorithms: the dark side of California ending cash bail",
"Summary": "The news is about California ending cash bail and replacing it with algorithm-based risk assessments. It discusses concerns about the potential negative impact of these algorithms, including the risk of indefinite imprisonment and racial biases. Activists and critics are worried that the new system may lead to more pre-trial incarcerations and harm communities of color. Despite bipartisan agreement on the flaws of the cash bail system, there is debate about the effectiveness of the algorithm-based replacement and calls for a focus on rehabilitation and due process."

"Specific_information": "The news is about the impact of Republican redistricting efforts on North Carolina A&T State University, the largest historically black university in the nation. In 2016, Republican state legislators divided the university's campus into separate congressional districts by drawing a line down Laurel Street, resulting in students crossing between the state's sixth and 13th districts, both represented by white Republicans. After a court decision late last year, the university's students will now vote in a general election under a single district. The newly minted sixth district includes the university and largely Black cities of Winston-Salem and Greensboro. The news discusses the impact of this redistricting on voter turnout, with an increase in young voters in the sixth district. It also mentions the activism and political engagement of students at A&T, who protested against racially biased districting. The article highlights the history of political activism at the university, including the Greensboro Four's sit-ins in 1960. It also discusses the need for fair redistricting and mentions that the state should consider models like California and Colorado, which involve citizens or independent bodies in drawing district lines."

"Specific_information": "The news is about a top U.S. university, Johns Hopkins, changing how it refers to Taiwan on a map detailing the spread of the new coronavirus. Initially, Johns Hopkins included Taiwan as part of China, but after protests from Taiwan's government, the university changed it to simply 'Taiwan.' Taiwan strongly objects to being identified as part of China and insists on its status as an independent country called the Republic of China. This change in naming was attributed to a comprehensive review of the dashboard by Professor Lauren Gardner and her team, aligning with the U.S. State Department naming conventions."
