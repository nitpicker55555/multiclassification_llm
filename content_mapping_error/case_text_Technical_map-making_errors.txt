"Specific_information": "This news is relevant to technical map-making errors because it discusses the distortion of the world map caused by the Mercator projection, a common template for world maps since 1569. The Mercator projection is known for making some landmasses, including Africa, appear smaller than they are in reality. The article also mentions that Boston schools are introducing the Peters projection, an alternative map projection, to teach children the real size of continents. It highlights how this distortion has been perpetuated and its potential consequences, including reinforcing notions of self-importance held by certain nations and even being used for propaganda."

"Specific_information": "The news is relevant to Technical map-making errors because it discusses a situation where Google's mapping teams made a mistake that resulted in detailed street-level video maps of US military bases being published on the internet. This incident involved the internal layout of Fort Sam Houston in Texas being inadvertently exposed. Google admitted that the footage was removed from its site within 24 hours, but the Pentagon still decided to issue a formal ban to prevent such incidents in the future. The concern raised by Air Force General Gene Renuart was that these 360-degree, street-level views could potentially reveal sensitive information like guard hut locations and building entries and exits, posing a security risk. Google acknowledged their mistake and stated that it goes against their policy to request access to military bases for capturing imagery in Street View. Hence, this news is relevant to Technical map-making errors."

"Specific_information": "The news is relevant to Technical map-making errors because it discusses the glaring errors and issues with Apple's new Maps service. Users complained about geographical errors, gaps in information, and missing features compared to Google Maps. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, issued an apology to customers for the frustration caused by these map errors and recommended that users download rival mapping services like Google Maps from the App Store. This demonstrates a significant problem with the accuracy and functionality of Apple's map-making, making it relevant to Technical map-making errors."

"Specific_information": "The news is relevant to Technical map-making errors. Tourism operators in Australia claim that inaccuracies in Google Maps are deterring potential visitors by making remote attractions appear further away than they actually are. Google Maps is accused of inflating travel times, which is causing problems for small businesses looking to promote their towns as remote tourist destinations. For example, the estimated travel time from Birdsville to Windorah was initially close to 11 hours, but after claims of inaccuracy, Google changed it to about 7 hours and 45 minutes. Locals say the drive is closer to four hours with no stops. This discrepancy in travel time is a clear example of technical map-making errors that are affecting tourism in the outback."

"Specific_information": "The news is about technical map-making errors. The specific information related to technical map-making errors is that Google Maps had an incorrect postcode for Simon Borghs' east London flat, causing delivery drivers to end up in the wrong location, specifically in parkland at Three Mills Green, Bromley-by-Bow, which was half a mile away as the crow flies but a mile and a half to drive. This error resulted in three years of frustration for Borghs and others, particularly affecting food delivery drivers from companies like Uber Eats and Deliveroo. Despite multiple attempts by Borghs and others to correct the error through feedback and community forums on Google Maps, the problem persisted until it was brought to the attention of the Observer, prompting Google to take action."

"Specific_information": "The news is about technical map-making errors related to Apple's mapping app. TomTom, the company that licenses its map data to Apple, defended the quality of its mapping systems after the iPhone 5 launch was marred by glitches in Apple's mapping app, which relies on TomTom's data. Users complained about geographical errors and missing information on the maps feature. The problems were related to points of interest (POIs), such as restaurants or shops, which are not part of the cartography supplied by TomTom. TomTom expressed its willingness to work with Apple to fix the issues but clarified that it licenses the map data, and the app's development is the responsibility of Apple. Despite the glitches in the Apple Maps app, TomTom stood by the quality of its data and emphasized that it does not know the exact cause of the issues on Apple Maps."

The provided news article titled "Survey subsidies wiped off the map" does not appear to be about Technical map-making errors. Instead, it discusses the government's decision to stop central subsidies for mapmaking, particularly in "uneconomic" parts of Britain. The key points of the news article are as follows:
The government has decided to stop providing subsidies to Ordnance Survey for mapping remote and less commercially viable areas of Britain.
Ordnance Survey argues that it needs the subsidy to maintain accurate maps of all parts of Britain, especially in emergencies.
The decision to end the subsidy has been met with surprise, as it pre-empts the findings of a geographical information strategy panel and goes against the consultation's results.
The subsidy was becoming obsolete due to a fast-evolving market in geographical information and budgetary pressures.
Commercial providers of geographical information have criticized the subsidy.
Ordnance Survey will continue to provide some Nimsa-funded services for emergency purposes.
There are concerns about the impact of ending the subsidy and potential privatization of Ordnance Survey.

It mentions instances where entire cities are misplaced, farms labeled as airports, highways leading to nowhere, and hospitals covering city centers. It also highlights errors in business listings, such as a taxi driver being listed as a taxidermist. Politicians and users have expressed concern about the potential dangers of these errors. Additionally, the absence of features like public transit directions and comprehensive traffic data, which are available in Google Maps, contributes to the technical map-making errors described in the news."

When the American Revolutionary War ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, a map maker's error about the source of the Mississippi River led to the incorrect drawing of the boundary between the US and Canada. This mapping error resulted in the protrusion of the Northwest Angle, making it disconnected from the rest of Minnesota and accessible by land only through the Canadian province. The news provides historical context about the mapping error and its impact on the region."

While the news mainly highlights the historical significance of the map and its auction, it mentions that the map was assessed to be about 75% complete. This percentage of completion suggests that there may have been errors or inaccuracies in the map-making process, which is a key aspect of Technical map-making errors."

The article mentions that Tele Atlas will use TomTom's extensive data, including speed profiles derived from customer measurements, to route drivers differently based on the day and time. This integration of data from millions of users of TomTom's navigation devices into map-making raises the potential for errors and deliberate abuse, as some users have submitted map improvements, and Tele Atlas is cautious about the risk of introducing errors."
