The ICO has warned that it may close down the My AI feature in the UK after a 'preliminary investigation.' Snapchat's AI chatbot, powered by ChatGPT, allows users to message a computer that mimics human conversation. The ICO expressed particular concern about the potential privacy risks for 13- to 17-year-old users, as Snapchat has 21 million users in the UK, many of whom are children. The ICO's code contains 15 standards for online services to follow to protect children's data online. If a final enforcement notice is adopted, Snap may not be able to offer the My AI function to UK users until they conduct 'an adequate risk assessment.' Snap has also faced criticism for being unclear about whether the chatbot can access private information, such as location data."
