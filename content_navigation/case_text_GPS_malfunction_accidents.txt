    "Specific_information": "This news is relevant to GPS malfunction incidents. It reports that GPS signals at Israel's Ben Gurion airport have been unreliable since early June, affecting pilots and planes using the location. The disruption of GPS signals has had a 'significant impact' on airport operations, as mentioned by Israel's Airports Authority. Additionally, the Israeli Airline Pilots Association described the issue as a 'spoofing' attack that produces incorrect location data, causing receivers on planes to report their location inaccurately. While the disruption has not resulted in accidents or safety incidents, it has clearly disrupted aviation operations. The article also mentions that there are suspicions of Russia's involvement in GPS spoofing and jamming, which is relevant to the topic of GPS malfunction accidents."
