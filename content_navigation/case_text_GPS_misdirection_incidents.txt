"Specific_information": "This news is relevant to GPS misdirection incidents because it reports on Iranian threats to commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf, which includes incidents of GPS interference. The US Department of Transportationâ€™s Maritime Administration has issued a warning about GPS interference reported by some ships in the region. Additionally, there are reports of unknown entities falsely claiming to be US or coalition warships. This interference with GPS and bridge-to-bridge communications can lead to navigation problems for ships, potentially causing them to enter Iranian waters or airspace by mistake. It is also mentioned that Iran has placed GPS jammers on Abu Musa Island to disrupt civilian aircraft and ship navigation systems. This deliberate interference with GPS systems is a key element of GPS misdirection incidents."
