"Reason": "This news is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking because it discusses the intentional disabling of automatic identification systems (AIS) on fishing vessels, which is a form of unauthorized tracking device manipulation.",
"Details": "The news highlights that up to 6% of global fishing activity involves the disabling of tracking systems, specifically AIS devices, by commercial vessels. This practice is used to hide illegal fishing activities, including unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The study applied a machine learning algorithm to a dataset of more than 3.7 billion AIS messages from fishing vessels between 2017 and 2019, revealing geographical hotspots where AIS disabling is prevalent, such as west Africa, the coast of Argentina, and the north-west Pacific, indicating potential locations for illegal fishing. The report also mentions that AIS disabling is a risk factor for fishing in unauthorized locations and unauthorized transshipments, which can be associated with illegal activities like laundering illegally caught seafood into the supply chain, forced labor, and human trafficking. While disabling AIS systems is not inherently illegal, it is considered a 'big red flag' by organizations like Global Fishing Watch. The study provides valuable insights into the extent and implications of unauthorized GPS tracking manipulation within the fishing industry."
