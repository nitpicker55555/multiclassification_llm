The firm, Huq, uses location data from apps on people's phones and sells it to clients, including English and Scottish city councils. They admitted that in two cases, its app partners had not asked for consent from users, which is a breach of data privacy requirements. Although the issue has been rectified, it raises concerns about GPS privacy breach as users' location data was collected and shared without their consent, violating their privacy."

The app's spy mode function was not mentioned in the app's description, and users were not adequately informed or given the opportunity to withdraw consent. The app only asked for permission to use the microphone twice per user, failing to provide active notifications each time it recorded, as suggested by the data protection watchdog. The LaLiga association plans to appeal the fine, arguing that the technology used did not capture personal data and that it was intended to combat piracy. Nevertheless, the news clearly highlights a breach of GPS privacy, as it involved the unauthorized use of GPS data to identify bars streaming games without proper broadcasting rights."

    "Details": "Security vulnerabilities in a popular Chinese-built GPS vehicle tracker (MV720) made by MiCODUS have been identified. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to easily track and remotely cut the engines of at least a million vehicles globally. The vulnerabilities include a hardcoded password in the Android app, which grants complete control over any GPS tracker, access to real-time location and past routes, and the ability to remotely cut off fuel to vehicles. Additionally, the default password for the GPS tracker is '123456,' making it accessible to anyone who hasn't changed the password. Other vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to data from vulnerable GPS trackers and generate spreadsheets containing device activity. The severity of these vulnerabilities has led both cybersecurity startup BitSight and CISA (the U.S. governmentâ€™s cybersecurity advisory agency) to warn vehicle owners to remove the devices to mitigate the risk. Despite being informed about these issues in September 2021, MiCODUS has made no efforts to fix the vulnerabilities."

The fitness tracking app Strava inadvertently revealed sensitive information about the location and staffing of military bases and spy outposts around the world through a data visualization map that showed all the GPS-tracked activities of its users. This map, released in November 2017, contained over 3 trillion individual GPS data points and was detailed enough to identify and map U.S. military bases. Military analysts, including Nathan Ruser from the Institute for United Conflict Analysts, noted that the heatmap could potentially compromise operational security (Op-Sec) for military personnel. The article highlights specific examples, such as U.S. bases in Syria and Afghanistan, where the Strava heatmap revealed the locations and even internal layouts of military bases.

It follows allegations that the app-based taxi company was able to monitor the whereabouts of passengers through its geolocation technology. It also failed to report a major data breach to authorities in a timely way. The investigation followed a BuzzFeed News story in 2014 that alleged one of its reporter's rides had been tracked without her permission. This was allegedly done through an internal company tool called 'God View,' which shows the location of Uber vehicles and customers who have requested a car and which was reportedly widely available to corporate employees. The attorney general also said Uber had taken five months to inform its drivers about a breach involving their personal data. The breach, which affected 50,000 drivers, occurred in May 2014 and was discovered by Uber in September 2014. But the firm admitted it did not tell its drivers or the public until February 2015. According to the settlement, it must also encrypt GPS-based location information and authenticate any employee accessing this data for business purposes."

    "Specific_information": "This news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because it discusses the updates made by Apple and Google to their coronavirus contact tracing technology. The key points that make it relevant to GPS privacy breach are:\n\n1. The technology mentioned in the news uses Bluetooth technology for contact tracing and explicitly states that it does not employ GPS location data. This indicates a focus on privacy protection and not utilizing GPS data, which is sensitive in terms of location tracking.\n\n2. The news mentions that the most sensitive data is stored in a decentralized way on users' phones. Storing data in a decentralized manner is a privacy measure to prevent centralized data storage, which can be vulnerable to breaches.\n\n3. The article discusses measures taken by Apple and Google to enhance user privacy, such as randomly generated user identifiers, encrypted metadata, and rounded exposure time intervals. These measures are designed to protect user information from tracking and privacy breaches.\n\n4. The companies are addressing concerns about false alerts and providing Bluetooth power level data to estimate proximity accurately, allowing authorities to set their own thresholds for alerts. This demonstrates a commitment to privacy and accuracy in contact tracing without relying on GPS data."
