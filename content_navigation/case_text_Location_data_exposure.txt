"Specific_information": "This news is about Location data exposure. The article discusses how Peloton and its rival Echelon were not stripping user-uploaded profile photos of their metadata, which, in some cases, exposed users' real-world location data. Security researcher Jan Masters found this metadata exposure, which was part of a wider investigation into Peloton's API. The article mentions that Peloton fixed its API issues but needed more time to fix the metadata bug and strip existing profile photos of location data. Echelon also fixed its version of the bug. It highlights the privacy risk associated with this exposure, as location data can reveal users' home addresses, workplaces, and other private locations. Additionally, the article references similar incidents with other platforms like Parler and Slack, which didn't scrub metadata from user-uploaded photos, exposing user locations."

Google has admitted to collecting Wi-Fi data through its Street View cars, which inadvertently gathered extracts of personal web activity from domestic Wi-Fi networks. Google's Street View cars were equipped with antennas that scanned local Wi-Fi networks, and this data was used for its location services. Although Google initially claimed to collect only Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs) and identifiers (Mac addresses), it has now acknowledged that it mistakenly collected samples of payload data from open Wi-Fi networks, totaling 600GB of data. This data consisted only of fragments of activity from open Wi-Fi networks, and it did not include data from password-protected web services or networks. Google attributed this mistake to legacy code from an experimental project that was reused for programming the Street View cars' equipment. The discovery has prompted Google to ground its Street View cars, disconnect the data from its network, and seek oversight for data deletion from a third party.

"Specific_information": "The news is relevant to Location data exposure because the messaging app JusTalk exposed a significant amount of user data, including millions of messages, phone numbers of senders and recipients, call records, and granular location data. The exposed database was accessible without a password and contained information from both the regular messaging app and a child-friendly version. This security lapse contradicts JusTalk's claims of end-to-end encryption, as none of the messages were encrypted. Additionally, the database was accessed by an unknown data extortionist, potentially putting user data at further risk. The exposed location data included information from users in the U.S., U.K., India, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and mainland China, as well as records from a third app, JusTalk 2nd Phone Number, which collected both users' cell phone numbers and ephemeral phone numbers they generated."

"Specific_information": "This news is about a data breach involving gun owners' information. The breach involves the exposure of thousands of names and addresses belonging to UK customers of a website for buying and selling shotguns and rifles (Guntrader.uk) to the dark web. The breach was considered a 'security breach,' and it has raised concerns among gun owners about their security. While the stolen data did not include information directly related to gun ownership or the location of firearms, it still poses a risk to gun owners as it includes personal information of individuals who own firearms. Shooting organizations like the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) are urging their members to be vigilant about home security in light of this breach. Police, including the National Crime Agency, are investigating the breach, and they have provided security advice to shotgun owners and urged them to report any suspicious activity. Overall, this news fits the category of 'Location data exposure' due to the exposure of gun owners' personal information and the potential risks it poses to their security."

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a Freedom of Information Act (Foia) request seeking the release of three years of records related to how the US government acquired cellphone location data collected through apps used by millions of Muslims worldwide. The investigation revealed that tech companies, including the one connected to the Muslim Pro app, sold personal location data of its users to the US military and defense contractors. This data exposure is a serious threat to privacy and religious freedom, and it potentially discriminates against Muslims. The records request is the first step and could lead to separate litigation. The news also highlights the use of tools like 'Locate X' to track cellphone movements and how location data can be easily de-anonymized. Various US government agencies, including the United States Special Operations Command and US Customs and Border Protection, have purchased access to such location data. The story also mentions X-Mode, which pays apps to collect and sell location data. The news further discusses the reactions of Muslim Pro app users and advocacy organizations, as well as promises of investigations by Senator Ron Wyden and others into the warrantless collection of phone location data."

The app uses Bluetooth short-range radio to measure the risk of exposure, which is a technology that does not rely on location data. Instead, it focuses on tracking encounters and contacts between individuals while maintaining their privacy. The app's security features include encrypted Bluetooth exchanges and pseudonyms to protect user identities, and no data is stored centrally. It is designed to complement existing contact tracing efforts and is intended for public settings and foreign travel monitoring."

The breach was discovered by a security researcher named Mossab H, who informed the company. Blind confirmed the exposure and began notifying affected users after media inquiry. While Blind stated that there was 'no evidence' of data misuse, it did not clarify how it reached that conclusion, and it remained unclear if U.S. state regulators would be notified of the breach.
