"Specific_information": "The news is about a failure in Russia's GPS system, known as GLONASS. The General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland issued a map illustrating the effects of the GLONASS system's failure. The GLONASS network experienced a half-day outage due to bad data being uploaded to spacecraft. The GLA map shows a GLONASS receiver at Harwich giving corrupted position fixes that were off by more than 50km. This incident serves as a timely reminder of the importance of alternatives to satellite navigation systems like GPS and GLONASS. It also mentions the UK's reliance on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and the need for receivers capable of switching seamlessly between different data sources in case of failures."

The issue occurred when 15 GPS satellites broadcasted the wrong time, with GPS time signals being 13 microseconds out of sync. This discrepancy is considered severe, causing system errors for Chronos telecoms clients. The GPS error was attributed to the decommissioning of a satellite named SVN 23 and was pushed to the satellites by 'ground system software.' The error led to thousands of system warnings being activated at some companies, affecting the accuracy of time measurements critical for data flow control in telecoms networks."

The automatic flight planning system used by Nats, the company responsible for national air traffic control services in the UK, was out of action for several hours due to a technical failure. This technical failure was triggered by a single piece of data in a flight plan that was wrongly input by an unnamed airline. While the airspace was not closed, the number of planes in the sky was severely restricted during the automated system's downtime. Although Nats claimed to have backup systems, the faulty data caused the secondary automatic processing system to be suspended to prevent incorrect safety-related information from reaching air traffic controllers.

The European Schiaparelli Mars lander crashed due to a sensor failure, causing it to cast away its parachute and turn off braking thrusters more than two miles above the surface of Mars. The error in the navigation system occurred because of a momentary glitch in a device that measured the spacecraft's spin rate. This erroneous information led to an estimated negative altitude, triggering a premature release of the parachute and a brief firing of the braking thrusters. As a result of this navigation system failure, the spacecraft activated its ground systems when it was still about 2.3 miles off the surface, ultimately leading to the crash of the lander on Mars.

Specific_information:
South Korea has revived a project to build a backup ship navigation system after experiencing GPS signal jamming attacks that disrupted fishing vessel operations.
The recent wave of GPS signal jamming attacks was blamed on North Korea.
South Korea will award a contract to secure technology to build an alternative land-based radio system called eLoran, which is intended to provide reliable alternative position and timing signals for navigation.
The jamming campaign from North Korea affected the signal reception of more than 1,000 aircraft and 700 ships.
The article highlights that GPS vulnerability poses security and commercial risks, especially for ships without backup electronic navigation systems.
It mentions that the U.S., Russia, and India are also looking into deploying versions of eLoran as a backup.
The disruption caused by GPS signal loss is described, including its impact on transportation, communication, financial systems, and the electrical grid.

"Specific_information": "The news is about a UK air traffic system failure that resulted in over 2,000 flights being canceled. The failure was blamed on 'an extremely rare set of circumstances.' According to a technical report from Nats, the air traffic control services provider, the failure was triggered by a single flight plan with confusing waypoint data, which brought their software system to a halt. The error in the plan, submitted by an incoming airline, forced the system to stop processing flight plans automatically, requiring controllers to handle operations manually. Nats stated that this failure was due to two identically named but separate waypoint markers outside the UK's airspace, a scenario that had not occurred in over 15 million flight plans processed in the past five years. While the failure did not present any danger, it caused significant disruption to passengers, airlines, and airports. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is conducting an inquiry into the incident and will review wider problems around the system failure and Nats' response. Airlines have also called for compensation reform due to the disruption, which may have cost them up to £100 million in customer care costs and lost revenue."

The article discusses the possible reasons for one of the worst cruise liner disasters, the Costa Concordia, which ran aground off Italy's west coast. It mentions over-reliance on electronic navigation systems as one of the possible reasons for the disaster. The article highlights that despite having state-of-the-art global positioning systems and collision avoidance radar tracking facilities, human error, and a failure of judgment by the captain are believed to have played a significant role in the incident. It also mentions that the ship deviated from the correct route and hit rocks near the coast, tearing a large hole in the hull. These details clearly indicate a failure in the ship's navigation system and human judgment, making this news relevant to Navigation system failure."

  "Specific_information": "The news is about a failure related to a technology project called the Digital Media Initiative (DMI). The DMI was intended to create a production system linked to the BBC's broadcasting archive but suffered from significant flaws. Instead of streamlining access to old video footage, it caused chaos and disruptions, including the inability of video editors to access archive footage for news reports. This situation led to editors having to physically transport tapes from the archive storage facility to the broadcasting house. The project incurred substantial costs (£98.4 million) and failed to deliver the intended benefits (£95.4 million) as it was significantly behind schedule. An independent review by PricewaterhouseCoopers will investigate the project's management, control, and governance issues, highlighting the magnitude of the failure. Director-general Tony Hall mentioned that off-the-shelf tools are now available that can perform the same tasks, rendering the project obsolete. The news clearly fits the category of a technology or system failure."
