"Specific_information": "The news is about a data leak involving Toyota, exposing the data of at least 260,000 car owners. The data leak was caused by a misconfiguration of Toyota's connected cloud service, which allowed external access to customer information. The exposed data includes in-vehicle device identifiers and mapping data used in the car navigation system, affecting customers in Japan who purchased a vehicle as far back as December 2007, with data exposed between February 2015 and May 2023. Additionally, personal information of customers outside of Japan, particularly in Asia and Oceania, was also exposed between October 2016 and May 2023. The exposed information may include customer names, postal and email addresses, customer identifying numbers, and vehicle registration and identifying numbers. While Toyota has no evidence that the data was accessed or copied, the incident represents a significant data leak."

The breach is reported to violate GDPR regulations, and the data protection office in Brandenburg, where Tesla's European gigafactory is located, has described the data leak as 'massive.' If the violation is proven, Tesla could face fines of up to 4% of its annual sales, which could be €3.26 billion ($3.5 billion).

The device, used for various purposes, including monitoring elderly patients and tracking vehicles, is manufactured in China and sold by multiple companies under different brand names. It connects to the 2G/GPRS cell network and can be remotely accessed and controlled by SMS. Security researchers from Fidus Information Security discovered that sending a specific text message with a keyword allows anyone to obtain the device's real-time location. Additionally, another command enables remote listening to the device's microphone without alerting anyone. The device can also be rendered useless by remotely killing its cell signal. Even though the device can be protected with a PIN, it's not enabled by default, and it can be remotely reset without needing a PIN. The security flaws put the privacy and safety of users at risk, and recalling the devices is suggested as a solution, but it may not be feasible. The news also mentions that fixing the security issues would be relatively simple by implementing unique codes and limiting functionality to authorized numbers. This information fits the category of Navigation system data leak due to the exposure of real-time location and unauthorized access to the device."

The initial fine of £183 million was reduced to £20 million due to the airline's financial difficulties and representations made by BA regarding the cyber-attack. Investigators found that BA had failed to implement sufficient security measures to protect customer data, and it took more than two months to detect the breach. Approximately 244,000 people had their full name, addresses, and payment card details, including the CVV security number, exposed. The ICO concluded that BA should have identified security weaknesses and implemented appropriate measures. This case was significant as it marked one of the first major enforcement actions under stricter data protection laws, allowing for larger fines based on a company's turnover."

In this breach, more than 170 people's email addresses were mistakenly copied into an email circulated on April 7, 2022, regarding a change in the location for a visa appointment with the UK Visa and Citizenship Application Service (UKVCAS). The UKVCAS, which is run on behalf of the Home Office by the private contractor Sopra Steria, was responsible for the breach. The email addresses included private Gmail accounts and those belonging to lawyers from various firms. The breach was acknowledged in an email apology sent on April 8, which referred to a 'data breach error' and expressed regret for any inconvenience caused. It clarified that the email only contained email addresses and no other personal information. The Home Office is reviewing its internal processes to prevent such errors in the future."

The breach compromised confidential emails and plans of some of its blue-chip clients, including government departments and household names. The attack went unnoticed for months and was discovered in March, but the attackers may have had access since October or November 2016. The hacker gained access to Deloitte's global email server through an 'administrator's account' with a single password and no two-step verification. The breach also potentially exposed usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams, and health information. Deloitte hired legal counsel to address the incident and confirmed that a small number of its clients were impacted. The investigation is ongoing to determine the identity of the hackers, but it is believed to be US-focused. Deloitte stated that the breach did not disrupt client businesses or its ability to serve clients, and it remains committed to enhancing cybersecurity."

"Specific_information": "The news is about a data leak involving California gun owners. The California department of justice mistakenly posted the names, addresses, and birthdays of nearly 200,000 gun owners on the internet due to officials not following policies or understanding how to operate their website. Personal information for 192,000 people was downloaded 2,734 times by 507 unique IP addresses during a roughly 12-hour period in late June. All of those affected had applied for a permit to carry a concealed gun. The data breach occurred just days after the US supreme court ruled that people have a right to carry guns in public, invalidating a California law. Although investigators did not find evidence of malicious intent, there are concerns about the exposed data, which likely includes information from people in sensitive positions, such as judges, law enforcement personnel, and domestic violence victims. The breach was not discovered by state officials but rather when someone sent attorney general Rob Bonta a private message on Twitter with screenshots of the personal information available on the state's website. The breach was initially mistaken for a hoax, and it took some time before the website was disabled, by which point the information had been downloaded thousands of times. The breach also involved the release of data from firearms safety certificates, dealer records of sale, and the state's assault weapons registry, affecting more than 2 million people and 8.7 million gun transactions. Investigators recommended more training and planning for state officials, including a review and update of policies and procedures."
