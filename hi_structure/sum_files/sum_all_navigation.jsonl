That was one of the many announcements out of Apple’s event this morning in Cupertino, where the company showcased its latest technical and service innovations.\nGoogle has offered car crash detection for some time on certain Pixel smartphone models, and the newly announced iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 14 Pro have it. But the Series 8 is one of — if not the only — smartwatch on the market with the feature.\nCar crash detection on the Series 8 — which was rumored late last year — is enabled by a new three-axis gyroscope and “high g-force” accelerometer that samples data four times faster than the previous generation (and up to 256 gs of force). Leveraging an algorithm running on the device, along with the barometer, the Series 8 can detect crashes in most types of vehicles and automatically notify emergency contacts and services if the users doesn’t respond within 10 seconds, Apple said.\nImage Credits: Apple\nApple explains it thusly in a press release: “To create the [crash detection] algorithm, data was collected from these new motion sensors at professional crash test labs with common passenger cars in simulated real-world accidents, including head-on, rear-end, side-impact and rollovers.\nIn addition to motion data, crash detection uses the barometer, GPS and the microphone on [a paired] iPhone as inputs to detect the unique patterns that can indicate whether a severe crash has taken place … When a severe car crash is detected, the emergency services call interface will appear on Apple Watch, as it is most likely to be in closer proximity to the user, while the call is placed through iPhone if it is in range for the best possible connection.”\nApple reportedly used data shared anonymously by iPhone and Apple Watch users to develop the aforementioned algorithm. According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple tapped a data set of more than 10 million suspected vehicle impacts to improve the accuracy of the crash detection system, cross-referencing the crash data with calls to 911 — since crashes associated with 911 calls are more likely to be legitimate.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to GPS malfunction accidents because it discusses the new Apple Watch Series 8's ability to detect car crashes using a combination of sensors, including GPS.

{"num":8,"Time":"Sat 25 Jun 2016 11.00 CEST","Title":"Death by GPS: are satnavs changing our brains?","Content":"O\nne early morning in March 2011, Albert Chretien and his wife, Rita, loaded their Chevrolet Astro van and drove away from their home in Penticton, British Columbia. Their destination was Las Vegas, where Albert planned to attend a trade show. Rather than stick to the most direct route, they decided to take a scenic road less travelled, Idaho State Highway 51. The Chretiens figured there had to be a turnoff from Idaho 51 that would lead them east to US Route 93 all the way to Vegas.\nAlbert and Rita had known each other since high school. During their 38 years of marriage, they had rarely been apart. They worked together, managing their own small excavation business. A few days before the trip, Albert had purchased a Magellan GPS unit for the van. They had not yet used it, but their plan wasn’t panning out. As the day went on and the shadows grew longer, they hadn’t found an eastward passage. They decided to consult the GPS. Checking their roadmap, they determined the nearest town was Mountain City, Nevada, so they entered it as the destination into their GPS unit. The directions led them on to a small dirt road near an Idaho ghost town and eventually to a confusing three-way crossroads. And here their troubles began.\nIf Albert had been navigating the route in the daytime, he might have noticed that it was taking them through the high desert as it rose toward shimmering snowy peaks in the distance. In the dark, the changes were so subtle that they barely registered. And besides, he was on a road – “a pretty good road”, the Elko county sheriff would later say, that “slowly goes bad”. Through the night, it carried them higher into the Jarbidge mountains, deeper into the back country. The road twisted, dipped, rose again, skirting canyons walled with sagebrush.\nSeveral days passed before their family and friends realised that Albert and Rita had never arrived at the trade show. The couple had not informed anyone of their detour, so nobody knew where to look for them. The manhunt involved police agencies in four states, scouring 3,000 miles of highway, with the most intense efforts in eastern Oregon, where they had used a credit card in a convenience store.\nOn 8 April, just shy of three weeks since Albert Chretien left Highway 51, authorities announced they were scaling back search and rescue efforts, a tacit admission that wherever the Chretiens had gone, it was too late to find them.\nA woman going to Brussels drove hundreds of miles to Zagreb, realising her mistake when she saw street signs in Croatian\nWhat happened to the Chretiens is so common in some places that it has a name. The rangers at Death Valley national park in California call it “death by GPS”. It describes what happens when your GPS fails you, not by being wrong, exactly, but often by being too right. It does such a good job of computing the most direct route from point A to point B that it takes you down roads that barely exist, or were used at one time and abandoned, or are not suitable for your car, or that require local knowledge that would make you aware that making that turn is bad news.\nDeath Valley’s vast arid landscape and temperature extremes make it a particularly dangerous place to rely on GPS. In the summer of 2009, Alicia Sanchez, a 28-year-old nurse, was driving through the park with her six-year-old son, Carlos, when her GPS directed her on to a vaguely defined road that she followed for 20 miles, unaware that it had no outlet. A week later, a ranger discovered Sanchez’s Jeep, buried in sand up to its axles, with SOS spelled out in medical tape on the windshield. “She came running toward me and collapsed in my arms,” the ranger wrote in a report. Her son had died. “I walked over to the Jeep and looked inside. I saw a boy slumped in the front seat.”\nMost death by GPS incidents do not involve actual deaths – or even serious injury. They are accidents or accidental journeys brought about by an uncritical acceptance of turn-by-turn commands: the Japanese tourists in Australia who drove their car into the ocean while attempting to reach North Stradbroke Island from the mainland; the man who drove his BMW down a narrow, steep path in a village in Yorkshire and nearly over a cliff; the woman in Bellevue, Washington, who drove her car into a lake that the GPS said was a road; the Swedish couple who asked GPS to guide them to the Mediterranean island of Capri, but instead arrived at the northern Italian industrial town of Carpi; the elderly woman in Belgium who tried to use GPS to guide her to Brussels, 90 miles from her home, but drove hundreds of miles to Zagreb, only realising her mistake when she noticed the street signs were in Croatian.\nThese types of mishaps often elicit sheer bafflement. The local Italian tourist official noted that although “Capri is an island”, the unfortunate Swedes “did not even wonder why they didn’t cross any bridge or take any boat”; the first responders in Bellevue were amazed that the woman “wouldn’t question driving into a puddle that doesn’t seem to end”. For their part, the victims often couch their experiences in language that attributes to GPS a peculiar sort of agency. GPS “told us we could drive down there”, one of the Japanese tourists explained. “It kept saying it would navigate us to a road.” The BMW driver echoed these words, almost verbatim: “It kept insisting the path was a road.”\nAnyone who has driven a car through an unfamiliar place can attest to how easy it is to let GPS do all the work. That GPS can have a transformative effect on a society is undeniable. We have come to depend on a technology that, in theory, makes it impossible to get lost. But not only are we still getting lost, we may actually be losing a part of ourselves.\nIn 1948, nearing the end of his career, Edward Tolman, a Berkeley psychology professor, published an article called Cognitive Maps In Rats And Men in the journal Psychological Review. He summarised several experiments that studied the wayfinding behaviour of rats wandering mazes in search of a reward. Tolman argued that they had much to teach us about how humans navigate and orient themselves.\nHe believed that the rats had a “cognitive map”, a mental representation of their environment, that could be divided into two basic models: strip maps and comprehensive maps. A strip map is a basic understanding of two points: an unbroken line from A to B. If one knows an environment intimately, and can add in more details, this can turn into a comprehensive map.\nBeginning in the early 1970s, Tolman’s cognitive map concept, or how we perceive locations in our mind’s eye, experienced a renaissance when it was adopted by psychologists, geographers, architects and anyone interested in wayfinding. Interpretations of the term vary, but most see the cognitive map as “a map-like representation within the ‘black box’ of the nervous system”, says geographer Rob Kitchin.\nWhich brings us to GPS, a technology Tolman never lived to see. What might Tolman have thought of our devotion to GPS as a means of making our way through this maze? The soothing voice of the turn-by-turn directions, guiding us through an unfamiliar environment, is the personification of the strip map. Allegiance to that strip map promotes the reasoning that lies behind the most baffling death-by-GPS scenarios, the willingness to “turn right here” when “here” is clearly a lake.\nThe car plunged off the bridge, dropping nearly 40ft to the ground near the water before it burst into flames\nBut the spectre of the strip map also haunts the scarier incidents, like the disappearance of the Chretiens – scary because we can imagine them happening to us. Who can fault Albert Chretien for following a road, even if he lacked a map comprehensive enough to know it was a road best not taken? Let those who have never experienced the liberating sensation of switching on GPS and switching off their navigational awareness cast the first stone.\nThe rise of personal GPS devices (including its integration into mobile phones) has been so meteoric that we are just beginning to take stock of how the technology can affect us. Are we witnessing the mass narrowing of the human cognitive map? If we are, we are doing it to ourselves, our love of GPS creating the conditions that lead to that narrowing.\nA British study, published in 2006, made headlines by revealing that the brains of London taxi drivers, whose licensing requires that they demonstrate recall of 25,000 city streets, plus the locations of landmarks and points of interest, contain more grey matter in the region of the hippocampus responsible for complex spatial representation than the brains of London bus drivers. Brain scan results from retired taxi drivers suggested, without being conclusive, that the volume of grey matter decreases when this ability is no longer required.\nThe idea that something similar may be happening on a large scale, as GPS use becomes more ubiquitous, is plausible enough to be taken seriously. More recent research has demonstrated that someone who does intensive exercises to improve navigational skills can exhibit changes in the hippocampus. Hugo Spiers, one of the scientists who conducted the London cab driver study, explains: “I think it’s possible that if you went to someone doing a lot of active navigation, but just relying on GPS – the assumption being that they’d be minimising the brain’s use for navigation – you’d actually get a reduction in that area.”\nIn a study conducted in Japan and published in 2008, three groups of walkers navigated routes in the city of Kashiwa. One group learned the route from direct experience; another group was given GPS devices; a third group was given a paper map with the beginning and end points marked, but no highlighted route. The results showed the GPS users exhibiting the weakest wayfinding acumen. They travelled at a slower speed and made more stops to reorient themselves than the walkers in the other groups. They rated the overall task as more difficult, and in post-walk tests, had the lowest scores on memory of the configuration and topology of the route.\nA Cornell University study published in the same year looked at GPS’s effect on drivers, and reached similar conclusions. Their research “found evidence for loss of environmental engagement”. Their conclusion: “GPS eliminated much of the need to pay attention.”\nSo what happens to our brains as we transition into a world where GPS does it all for us? Some cognitive experts believe we may be undergoing fundamental changes. “Physical maps help us build cognitive maps,” Julia Frankenstein of the Center for Cognitive Science at the University of Freiburg in Germany has argued.\nSpending our days moving through various environments, we fill in the details of our cognitive map based on our egocentric experiences. Can the granular detail of that map fade through misuse? “The problem with GPS systems is, in my eyes, that we are not forced to remember or process the information. As it is permanently ‘at hand’, we need not think or decide ourselves,” Frankenstein says. “The more we rely on technology to find our way, the less we build up our cognitive maps.” Life becomes a series of strip maps: “We see the way from A to Z, but we don’t see the landmarks along the way… developing a cognitive map from this reduced information is a bit like trying to get an entire musical piece from a few notes.”\nEven if we were to discover that its use is reshaping the physical contours of our brains, there would still be an elusive, unknowable element to our personal cognitive map. It remains locked away in the black box of the nervous system, accessible when we need it but never fully unfurling for us to examine.\nIn March 2015, Iftikhar and Zohra Hussain were driving from their home in Chicago to Indiana to visit family. As Iftikhar approached a bridge that spanned the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal, he ignored orange cones, Road Closed signs, and other deterrents meant to keep cars away, since the bridge had been closed for repairs since 2009. The car plunged off the bridge, dropping nearly 40ft to the ground near the water. Iftikhar managed to escape before it burst into flames. Zohra died from her burns. A local paper, citing a police investigator, reported that Iftikhar “was apparently paying more attention to the navigation system than what was in front of him”. Assuming that were true, the question still remains: what was going through his head?\nNearly two months after the Chretiens disappeared, three hunters in an all-terrain vehicle, somewhere in the Independence mountains, came across a Chevy Astro. A woman wearing a plaid shirt and jeans managed with great effort to open the sliding door and poke her head out.\nThe Chretiens had remained on the road that night, eventually realising they had no choice but to press on. It was too narrow and treacherous for them to turn around. In the morning, they discovered that the road soon narrowed into a trail. It still looked to them like they were heading in the direction of Mountain City, which they estimated was about 27 miles away.\nPlease help. We’re headed to Vegas. Got lost. No food. No gas. Al went for help. Did not return! Maybe died?\nThe next morning, they decided that Albert would set off on foot. Rita had injured her knee on the hike the day before and found it hard to walk. Albert figured it would take him between two to three days to reach Mountain City. Dividing their meagre supplies, they decided that Al should take the bag of chocolate-covered almonds for energy. Rita’s take included a small sandwich bag filled with trail mix, some hard candy, and fish oil. Al wrote down the GPS coordinates for Mountain City, and took the Magellan with him.\nRita carefully rationed her food, eating as little as she could each day. She melted snow and gathered water from a nearby creek. She wrote notes in case she was found: “Please help. Stuck.” “We’re headed to Vegas. Got lost.” “No food. No gas… Al went to get help. Find Mountain City. Did not return! Maybe died along way?” One note gave her GPS coordinates. She grew too weak to walk to the stream, and drank what water she could from puddles. Just before she was rescued, she decided she had one more day left in her. She put on fresh socks, wrapped a blanket around her, and prepared to die.\nHer rescuers gave her what little food and water they had, but realised she was too weak to ride on an all-terrain vehicle. One remembered a ranch eight miles away, and they asked if she could hold out for one more hour. They found the ranch, called 911, and led the sheriff’s helicopter to Rita’s location. By the time they reached her, she had torn down the notes, packed her bags and was smiling. She was airlifted to a hospital, where she was gradually reintroduced to food and spent Mother’s Day with her children. Rita Chretien, 56 years old, with no outdoor experience and next to no provisions, had somehow survived for seven weeks in the wilderness, a trial that would have taxed the most hardened survivalist.\nIn December 2012, nearly two years after her ordeal, Rita and four of her friends took another road journey, what she called a “trip of gratitude”. She wanted to visit the regions where people had organised searches for the Chretiens, to meet as many of them as possible and say thank you. She also had a chance to see her rescuers again. They had been back several times to the site where they found her, trying to find where Albert had gone. Now they wanted to take her back there, too. She was initially dubious, but accepted the invitation. Little had changed. The Astro’s tracks were still visible. “I showed them where I got my water,” she says today. “It was very emotional, seeing my old fire pit.”\nShe was also able to meet the man from the Elko county sheriff’s office who had organised the search party. “I had tried to figure out how on earth we got lost,” she says. “He said he realised we had followed exactly what the GPS said, because he went and followed what I told him, and from there ended up exactly where we ended up.”\nOne week after returning from her gratitude trip, she received a call from the sheriff. Albert’s remains had been found some seven miles from the van. He had made it a little more than halfway to Mountain City before succumbing to hypothermia and exhaustion. The Magellan, designed to run off a car’s battery power, had probably fizzled soon after he began his journey.\nRita remains remarkably serene and philosophical about her experience. “I’m not so sure I want to venture out on strange roads any more,” she says, laughing quietly. “I just stick to the main roads now.” In 2015, she remarried.\nIn his final hours, Albert’s course had veered north. He ascended 2,600 vertical feet, through snowdrifts taller than he was. “He did a lot of unnecessary climbing,” a sheriff’s deputy noted. “He was heading literally for the summit of the mountain.” Rita thinks she knows why. “I believe Albert climbed towards the peak to find shelter, but also to have a good look around,” she says. “To see where to head from there.”\nThis is an edited extract from Pinpoint: How GPS Is Changing Our World, by Greg Milner, published by Granta on 7 July at £14.99.

{"num":11,"Time":"JUNE 20, 2011","Title":"GPS interference alters LightSquared's mobile plans","Content":"By Sinead Carew, Matthew Goldstein\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - LightSquared is dramatically altering its plans for a high-speed wireless network because of interference problems with GPS services, in the latest setback for hedge fund manager Philip Falcone’s telecom start-up.\nSanjiv Ahuja, Chariman and CEO of LightSquared delivers his keynote address at the International CTIA wireless industry conference in Orlando, Florida March 23, 2011. REUTERS\/Scott Audette\nFalcone and his Harbinger Capital Partners’ investors have gambled billions of dollars on the success of LightSquared. The company said on Monday that it would now use a different block of wireless airwaves for its network than originally planned, after months of testing found the interference problems.\nAnalysts say LightSquared, which still needs billions of dollars more funding to build its network, may face more difficulty raising money in light of the interference problem with GPS services, which are used in everything from airline navigation to defense systems.\nThe new plan will also likely delay LightSquared’s wireless launch, which is expected next year, analysts said.\nTo date, Harbinger has sunk about $3.1 billion into LightSquared -- making the hedge fund the company’s largest single equity investor. The telecom venture also has sold over a $1 billion in short-term debt.\n“It is very hard to see how you justify an equity value for this business (in line with) what Harbinger has invested,” unless it can show it will be able to use all the spectrum it owns within two or three years, Tim Farrar, an independent satellite industry analyst said.\nFalcone -- one of the hedge fund industry’s better-known traders -- has previously said he may take LightSquared public to raise funds this year. The venture has become one of the billionaire manager’s riskiest and most high-profile bets.\nLightSquared said it has paid satellite provider Inmarsat Plc an additional $40 million to prepare the alternative spectrum for use by early next year on top of its earlier agreement to pay Inmarsat $337.5 million. LightSquared is leasing some spectrum from Inmarsat for its network.\nDELAYS AHEAD?\nUnder the revised plan, LightSquared’s CEO Sanjiv Ahuja told Reuters that customers would be able to test its service in early 2012 and launch commercial services around mid 2012.\nBTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said LightSquared could ill-afford any delays, given competitive pressure from well established rivals such as Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc, which already offer high-speed wireless services.\n“It’s questionable whether the new spectrum will be ready in time to meet that new timeline,” said Piecyk who had expected commercial services in early 2012.\nLightSquared said the new spectrum band it plans to use would be “largely free” of interference from more than 99 percent of GPS devices. It expects to find a way to resolve interference with remaining devices, Ahuja said.\nIn the meantime, Ahuja said he would also try to remedy the larger GPS interference problems in the original spectrum in time to use that spectrum in “a couple of years.”\nGPS service providers including Deere & Co, General Motors and Trimble Navigation had said they were concerned that LightSquared’s network as it was originally planned would cause serious interference. Trimble had argued that LightSquared should use different airwaves.\nThe GPS camp was still unhappy with LightSquared’s plans. The alternative spectrum would still interfere with “many critical GPS receivers,” said Trimble general counsel Jim Kirkland who represents the Coalition to Save Our GPS, a group that inclues big GPS users and suppliers. “This latest gambit by LightSquared borders on the bizarre,” he said.\nUnder the new plan, LightSquared said it had agreed to use more than 50 percent less power to transmit wireless signals in its network to provide additional protection to GPS. Executives for the company said this would not impair its mobile service.\nINVESTMENT RISK\nLightSquared had to ask U.S. regulators for an extension to its June 15 deadline to file a report about interference issues until July 1. It was granted the extension.\nLightSquared has been in talks with Sprint Nextel about a network-sharing agreement aimed at reducing network construction costs for LightSquared.\nFalcone sent Harbinger investors a letter last week saying LightSquared had signed the Sprint deal but did not provide financial details, according to sources familiar with the letter who asked not to be named because the letter was not made public.\nAhuja declined comment on whether a deal had been finalized or how much it might be worth. Reuters had previously reported that the deal would involve LightSquared paying Sprint about $2 billion a year for 8 years.\nHarbinger investors have said they are worried about Falcone’s plan to set up a new wireless operator and say he may have bet too much of their money on its success. The LightSquared investment represents a little over half of Harbinger’s assets under management.\nFalcone is giving some investors who have asked to get their money out of his fund some non-tradable LightSquared shares instead of cash.\nFor Falcone, the sudden change in direction for LightSquared further illustrates his own ups and downs as a hedge fund manager in the last few years.\nThanks to a bold, contrarian bet that U.S. mortgage defaults would surge, he became an investment-industry darling in 2007 when his returns rose 116 percent. But since then, assets have shrunk from about $26 billion to about $6 billion.\n(Additional reporting Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Boston; editing\nby Gary Hill, Bernard Orr)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS malfunction accidents because it discusses interference problems with GPS services caused by LightSquared's high-speed wireless network plans.

Without the waiver, he said, ULA could not compete for that launch or any other new national security launches until an American-built engine is ready in 2019.\n“That’s not a viable business model,” he told reporters.\nBruno said the company needed a decision to be able to submit a bid for the GPS launch competition, the first time in nearly a decade that launches of large U.S. military satellites will be opened to competition.\nClaire Leon, director of the Launch Enterprise Directorate at Air Force Space Command, said ULA has the option of formally requesting an RD-180 waiver as part of its bid.\n“It is critical to the Air Force that we get more than one bidder. We are actively working different ways to make it possible for ULA to bid,” Leon told reporters on a conference call. “We are hoping that they will bid on this proposal.”\nU.S. lawmakers banned use of the Russian engines for U.S. military and spy satellite launches last year after Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.\nThe Air Force earlier this year approved privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, to compete for such launches against ULA, which has been the monopoly provider for most Air Force satellite launches since its creation in 2006.\nThe Air Force issued final rules for the GPS 3 launch competition on Wednesday, and bids are due Nov. 16.\n“Today I still have no engines to bid,” Bruno told reporters after ULA’s 100th consecutive successful launch, an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket carrying a Mexican communications satellite.\nThe ban does not affect RD-180 engines used for NASA and commercial missions, but whenever ULA taps its current RD-180 inventory for non-military flights, it cannot order a replacement for later use on a military missions.\nBruno said ULA is burning through its supply of RD-180 engines at a rate of one every four to six weeks.\nBruno said the ban affected 24 of 29 engines that ULA had ordered from Russia, but not paid for, before Russia invaded Crimea. The five engines that could be used under the law had already been assigned to other missions and were not available for ULA to use in a bid for the GPS III launch, he said.\nBruno said he was encouraged that U.S. lawmakers had allowed use of four more engines in a compromise version of the fiscal 2016 defense authorization bill. But President Barack Obama has said he plans to veto the bill, which means ULA needs a Pentagon waiver.

(Reuters) - A SpaceX rocket blasted off on Wednesday to put a U.S. satellite into deep space, where it will keep tabs on solar storms and image Earth from nearly 1 million miles (1.6 million km) away. Illuminated by the setting sun, the 22-story Falcon 9 rocket soared off its seaside launch pad at 6:03 p.m. EST (2303 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.\nThe launch was delayed on Sunday by a problem with a radar tracking system and on Tuesday by high winds.\nWeather was pristine for launch on Wednesday, but high seas prompted SpaceX to cancel a test to land the rocket’s discarded first stage on a platform in the ocean. “Unfortunately we will not be able to attempt to recover the first stage of the Falcon 9,” SpaceX said in a statement. Waves three stories tall were crashing over the decks of the landing platform, SpaceX said. The company has been developing technology to reuse its rockets, potentially slashing launch costs. The rocket carries the Deep Space Climate Observatory, nicknamed DSCOVR, a $340 million mission backed by NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Air Force, which paid for the launch. DSCOVR replaces a 17-year-old satellite monitoring for potentially dangerous solar storms, which can disrupt GPS signals, block radio communications and impact power grids on Earth. It will take DSCOVR 110 days to reach its operational orbit around the sun, almost 1 million miles (1.6 million km) inward from Earth, where it will serve as a weather buoy, providing about an hour’s advance notice of threatening solar activity. The satellite’s original mission, championed by then-Vice President Al Gore, was to provide a near-continuous view of Earth that would be distributed via the Internet in an attempt to raise environmental awareness, much like the iconic Apollo 17 “Blue Marble” picture of Earth did in the 1970s. The satellite, then called Triana - and lampooned as GoreSat - was due to launch on the space shuttle, but the mission was canceled. Triana spent more than a decade in storage before it was refurbished and reborn as a solar observatory. DSCOVR also has two sensors to monitor Earth to track volcanic plumes, measure ozone and monitor droughts, flooding and fires. It also will take pictures of Earth every two hours that will be posted on the Internet, fulfilling in part Gore’s dream.\nEditing by Lisa Shumaker\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the JSON format response based on the provided news article:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"The news article is relevant to GPS malfunction accidents because it mentions that the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) mission is designed to monitor potentially dangerous solar storms.

It is about the size of a small plane, has cameras on board, and can be armed with laser-guided bombs.\nA Bayraktar drone was used in the attack which sank the Russian warship Moskva in the Black Sea in April 2022.\nRussia also uses the smaller, more basic Orlan-10, which has cameras and can carry small bombs.\nHow have military drones been used?\nFor both sides - Russia and Ukraine - drones have been effective for locating enemy targets and guiding artillery fire toward them.\nIn the past, observers might have had to spend 20 or 30 minutes pinpointing a target, says Dr Jack Watling, defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute.\nNow, however, he says: \"Russian forces can bring their guns to bear on the enemy within only three to five minutes of an Orlan-10 drone spotting the target.\"\nDr Marina Miron, defence researcher at Kings College London, says drones have allowed Ukraine to stretch its limited forces.\n\"If you wanted to seek out enemy positions in the past, you would have had to send out special forces units... and you might have lost some troops,\" she says. \"Now, all you're risking is a drone.\"\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nEPA\nImage caption,\nRussian Orlan-10 drones can target artillery fire on enemy positions within minutes\nThe main problem in using military drones is that they are large and slow moving, and are easy to shoot down.\nThey are also expensive to replace - a single Bayraktar TB2 costs about $2m (£1.7m).\nHow are non-military drones being used?\nBoth sides in the war - but especially Ukraine - have increasingly been using small, cheap commercial models of drone such as the DJI Mavic 3, which costs about £1,700.\nThese can be fitted with small bombs, but are mainly used to spot enemy troops and to direct attacks.\nHowever, commercial drones are much less capable than military ones.\nFor example, the DJI Mavic's total flying distance is only 30km, and it can only fly for a maximum of 46 minutes.\nRussia is using electronic devices to counter them, says Dr Miron.\n\"Russian forces have the Stupor rifle, which shoots electromagnetic pulses,\" she says. This stops commercial drones from being able to navigate using GPS, she explains.\nRussian forces have also used online systems, such as Aeroscope, to detect and interrupt communications between commercial drones and their operators.\nThese systems can cause a drone to crash or return to base, and can stop it sending back information.\nRelated Topics\nRussia-Ukraine war\nDrones\nUkraine\nMore on this story\nDozens send 'dronations' to help Ukraine fight\nPublished\n8 July 2022\nUkraine war: Is the tank doomed?\nPublished\n7 July 2022","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS malfunction accidents because it discusses the use of 'kamikaze' drones by Russia and Ukraine in their ongoing conflict.

REUTERS\/Beck Diefenbach\nPolice in southeast Victoria state said they had been forced to rescue a number of motorists who had become stuck for up to 24 hours “without food or water” after being directed to the arid Murray Sunset National Park, instead of the tourist town of Mildura, 70 km (43 miles) away.\n“We had a fellow trapped in there just on Friday night after his car became bogged. He saw a snake, a goat and a fox, and he was too scared to get out of the car,” Mildura police Inspector Simon Clemence told Reuters on Tuesday.\nThe Murray-Sunset National Park is in Victoria’s far northwest, a relatively untouched semi-arid region accessible only by four-wheel-drive vehicle.\nClemence said at least six vehicles had become stuck on the desert park’s sandy tracks after being directed by the iOS mapping system to turn off a long and infrequently sign-posted stretch of highway between South Australia state and Victoria.\n“These people have still been rescuable. But we’ve just had a 46C day (115 degrees F). If they were out there in that temperature and out of phone range, they would have been in serious trouble,” he said.\nClemence said police had contacted Apple over the issue. But while the world’s most valuable company had now rectified Mildura’s location for people travelling from South Australia, motorists seeking directions from Melbourne city were still being directed off course by iOS.\n“If you punch in Melbourne to Mildura, it still puts you in the middle of the park,” he said. “So they’ve got it half right.”\nPolice said people should not blindly rely on technology to get them to their location, although in fairness he said people could easily become misdirected over long stretches of road along the 377-km Mallee Highway.\n“There’s nothing to signpost, and people are just driving and driving when their GPS phone suddenly says turn,” Clemence said.\n“But anyone who has used a GPS would know, they all make mistakes. You have to use your common sense and your eyes, and if it doesn’t look right, then it probably isn’t right.”\nApple’s chief executive Tim Cook apologised to customers in September for problems with the new mobile mapping application and suggested they use a rival product from Google until the multitude of errors could be ironed out.\nApple also sacked the executive behind the mapping software, and handed responsibility for hardware and software design to the company’s industrial design guru Jonathan Ive.\nEditing by Michael Roddy\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to GPS misdirection incidents because it discusses incidents where motorists using Apple's iPhone mapping software were directed to the wrong location.

For this fee, it received 460 million rows of data from more than 140,000 phones and tablets.

The council had detailed in a report last year how Grindr and other dating apps leaked personal information to advertising technology companies for targeted ads in ways the council said violated the EU’s tough GDPR privacy rules.\nNorway isn’t a member of the EU but closely mirrors the bloc’s rules and regulations.\n“The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that this is a serious case,” said Director-General Bjorn Erik Thon. “Users were not able to exercise real and effective control over the sharing of their data.”\nThe company has until Feb. 15 to give feedback, which the watchdog will take into account for its final decision.\nGrindr said it looked forward to holding a “productive dialogue” with Norwegian regulators about the allegations, which it said date back to 2018 and don’t reflect current privacy policy or practices.\nThe app’s privacy approach includes “detailed consent flows, transparency, and control” provided to all users, the company said, adding it has “retained valid legal consent” from all its European users “on multiple occasions.”\n“We continually enhance our privacy practices in consideration of evolving privacy laws and regulations,” the company said in a statement.\nThe watchdog’s preliminary conclusion is that Grindr shared user data with a number of third parties without legal basis. The data included GPS location, user profile information as well as the fact that users are on Grindr, which could indicate their sexual orientation.\nSharing such information could put someone at risk of being targeted, the authority said in its notice to Grindr.\nThe fact that a person “is a Grindr user may lead to prejudice and discrimination even without revealing their specific sexual orientation,” it said.\nThe Data Protection Authority said the way Grindr asked users for permission to use their information went against GDPR’s requirements for “valid consent.” Users weren’t given the chance to opt out of sharing data with third parties and were forced to accept Grindr’s privacy policy in its entirety, it said, adding that users weren’t properly informed about the data sharing.\nThe watchdog is still investigating five “ad tech” companies that received data from Grindr, including Twitter’s mobile app advertising platform, MoPub, which has more than 160 partners.\nThe Norwegian Consumer Council welcomed the fine.\n“We hope that this marks the starting point for many similar decisions against companies that engage in buying and selling personal data,” said the group’s director of digital policy, Finn Myrstad.\n___\nJan M.

{"num":12,"Time":"12:15 PM GMT+2•June 12, 2019","Title":"LaLiga fined $280K for soccer app’s privacy-violating spy mode","Content":"Spanish soccer’s premier league, LaLiga, has netted itself a €250,000 (~$280k) fine for privacy violations of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) related to its official app.\nAs we reported a year ago, users of the LaLiga app were outraged to discover the smartphone software does rather more than show minute-by-minute commentary of football matches — but can use the microphone and GPS of fans’ phones to record their surroundings in a bid to identify bars which are unofficially streaming games instead of coughing up for broadcasting rights.\nUnwitting fans who hadn’t read the tea leaves of opaque app permissions took to social media to vent their anger at finding they’d been co-opted into an unofficial LaLiga piracy police force as the app repurposed their smartphone sensors to rat out their favorite local bars.\nThe spy mode function is not mentioned in the app’s description.\nEl Diaro reports the fine being issued by Spain’s data protection watchdog, the AEPD. A spokesperson for the watchdog confirmed the penalty but told us the full decision has not yet been published.\nPer El Diaro’s report, the AEPD found LaLiga failed to be adequately clear about how the app recorded audio, violating Article 5.1 of the GDPR — which requires that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. It said LaLiga should have indicated to app users every time the app remotely switched on the microphone to record their surroundings.\nIf LaLiga had done so that would have required some form of in-app notification once per minute every time a football match is in play, being as — once granted permission to record audio — the app does so for five sections every minute when a league game is happening.\nInstead the app only asks for permission to use the microphone twice per user (per LaLiga’s explanation).\nThe AEPD found the level of notification the app provides to users inadequate — pointing out, per El Diaro’s reports, that users are unlikely to remember what they have previously consented each time they use the app.\nIt suggests active notification could be provided to users each time the app is recording, such as by displaying an icon that indicates the microphone is listening in, according to the newspaper. \nThe watchdog also found LaLiga to have violated Article 7.3 of the GDPR which stipulates that when consent is being used as the legal basis for processing personal data users should have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Whereas, again, the LaLiga app does not offer users an ongoing chance to withdraw consent to its spy mode recording after the initial permission requests.\nLaLiga has been given a month to correct the violations with the app. However in a statement responding to the AEPD’s decision the association has denied any wrongdoing — and said it plans to appeal the fine.\n“LaLiga disagrees deeply with the interpretation of the AEPD and believes that it has not made the effort to understand how the technology [functions],” it writes. “For the microphone functionality to be active, the user has to expressly, proactively and on two occasions grant consent, so it can not be attributed to LaLiga lack of\ntransparency or information about this functionality.”\n“LaLiga will appeal the decision in court to prove that has acted in accordance with data protection regulations,” it adds.\nA video produced by LaLiga to try to sell the spy mode function to fans following last year’s social media backlash claims it does not capture any personal data — and describes the dual permission requests to use the microphone as “an exercise in transparency”.\nClearly, the AEPD takes a very different view.\nLaLiga’s argument against the AEPD’s decision that it violated the GDPR appears to rest on its suggestion that the watchdog does not understand the technology it’s using — which it claims “neither record, store, or listen to conversations”.\nSo it looks to be trying to push its own self-serving interpretation of what is and isn’t personal data. (Nor is it the only commercial entity attempting that, of course.)\nIn the response statement, which we’ve translated from Spanish, LaLiga writes:\nThe technology used is designed to generate exclusively a specific sound footprint (fingerprint acoustic). This fingerprint only contains 0.75% of the information, discarding the remaining 99.25%, so it is technically impossible to interpret the voice or human conversations.\nThis fingerprint is transformed into an alphanumeric code (hash) that cannot be reversed to recreate the original sound. The technology’s operation is backed by an independent expert report, that among other arguments that favor our position, concludes that it “does not allow LaLiga to know the contents of any conversation or identify potential speakers”. Furthermore, it adds that this fraud control mechanism “does not store the information captured from the microphone of the mobile” and “the information captured by the microphone of the mobile is subjected to a complex transformation process that is irreversible”.\nA spokesperson for LaLiga told us it was unable to send the expert report cited in the statement.\nIn comments to El Diaro, LaLiga also likens its technology to the Shazam app — which compares an audio fingerprint to try to identify a song also being recorded in real-time via the phone’s microphone.\nHowever Shazam users manually activate its listening feature, and are shown a visual ‘listening’ icon during the process. Whereas LaLiga has created an embedded spy mode that systematically switches itself on thereafter, after being granted two initial permissions. So it’s perhaps not the best comparison to try to suggest.\nLaLiga’s statement adds that the audio eavesdropping on fans’ surroundings is intended to “achieve a legitimate goal” of fighting piracy. \n“LaLiga would not be acting diligently if it did not use all means and technologies at its fingertips to fight against piracy,” it writes. “It is a particularly relevant task taking into account the enormous magnitude of fraud in the marketing system, which is estimated at approximately 400 million euros per year.”\nLaLiga also says it will not be making any changes to how the app functions because it already intends to remove what it describes to El Diario as “experimental” functionality at the end of the current football season, which ends June 30.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because it involves the LaLiga soccer app using the microphone and GPS of fans' phones to record their surroundings without clear and continuous user consent.

The app only asked for permission to use the microphone twice per user, failing to provide active notifications each time it recorded, as suggested by the data protection watchdog. The LaLiga association plans to appeal the fine, arguing that the technology used did not capture personal data and that it was intended to combat piracy.

Worse, the company that makes the GPS trackers has made no effort to fix them.\nCybersecurity startup BitSight said it found six vulnerabilities in the MV720, a hardwired GPS tracker built by MiCODUS, a Shenzhen-based electronics maker, which claims more than 1.5 million GPS trackers in use today across more than 420,000 customers worldwide, including companies with fleets of vehicles, law enforcement agencies, militaries and national governments. BitSight said in its report that it also found the GPS trackers used by Fortune 50 companies and a nuclear power plant operator.\nBut the security flaws can be easily and remotely exploited to track any vehicle in real time, access past routes and cut the engines of vehicles in motion.\nPedro Umbelino, principal security researcher at BitSight who authored the report seen by TechCrunch before its publication, said the vulnerabilities are “not difficult to exploit,” and that the nature of the flaws leaves “significant questions about the vulnerability of other models,” suggesting the bugs may not be limited to the one MiCODUS GPS tracker model.\nGiven the severity of the bugs and that there are no fixes, both BitSight and CISA, the U.S. government’s cybersecurity advisory agency, warned vehicle owners to remove the devices as soon as possible to mitigate the risk.\nThe six vulnerabilities vary in severity and exploitability, but all but one rank as “high” severity or greater. Some of the bugs are in the GPS tracker itself, while others are in the web dashboard that customers use to track their vehicle fleets.\nThe most severe flaw is a hardcoded password that can be used to gain complete control of any GPS tracker, access to vehicles’ real-time location and past routes, and remotely cut off fuel to vehicles. Because the password is embedded directly into the code of the Android app, anyone can dig around the code and find it.\nA map with red points representing a MiCODUS user.

BitSight found 95% of a sample of 1,000 devices it tested were accessible with an unchanged default password, likely because device owners aren’t prompted to change the device’s password on setup.\nTwo of the remaining vulnerabilities, known as insecure direct object references — or IDORs — allow a logged-in user to access data from a vulnerable GPS tracker that didn’t belong to them, and generate spreadsheets containing device activity, such as past locations and routes.\nThe researchers said they found vulnerable MiCODUS GPS trackers all over the world, with the highest concentration of devices in Ukraine, Russia, Uzbekistan and Brazil, as well as across Europe, including Spain, Poland, Germany and France. Kevin Long, a spokesperson for BitSight, told TechCrunch that it saw a smaller percentage of devices in the United States but that the figure is likely “thousands” of devices.\nBitSight CEO Stephen Harvey said the vulnerabilities have the potential to result in “disastrous consequences” for affected vehicle owners. The security company first contacted MiCODUS in September 2021, but no efforts were made to fix the vulnerabilities ahead of the report’s publication.

{"num":2,"Time":"Sun 28 Jan 2018 22.51 CET","Title":"Fitness tracking app Strava gives away location of secret US army bases","Content":"Sensitive information about the location and staffing of military bases and spy outposts around the world has been revealed by a fitness tracking company.\nThe details were released by Strava in a data visualisation map that shows all the activity tracked by users of its app, which allows people to record their exercise and share it with others.\nStrava suggests military users 'opt out' of heatmap as row deepens\nRead more\nThe map, released in November 2017, shows every single activity ever uploaded to Strava – more than 3 trillion individual GPS data points, according to the company. The app can be used on various devices including smartphones and fitness trackers like Fitbit to see popular running routes in major cities, or spot individuals in more remote areas who have unusual exercise patterns.\nHowever, over the weekend military analysts noticed that the map is also detailed enough that it potentially gives away extremely sensitive information about a subset of Strava users: military personnel on active service.\nNathan Ruser, an analyst with the Institute for United Conflict Analysts, first noted the lapse. The heatmap “looks very pretty” he wrote, but is “not amazing for Op-Sec” – short for operational security. “US Bases are clearly identifiable and mappable.”\n“If soldiers use the app like normal people do, by turning it on tracking when they go to do exercise, it could be especially dangerous,” Ruser added, highlighting one particular track that “looks like it logs a regular jogging route.”\n“In Syria, known coalition (ie US) bases light up the night,” writes analyst Tobias Schneider. “Some light markers over known Russian positions, no notable colouring for Iranian bases … A lot of people are going to have to sit through lectures come Monday morning.”\nIn locations like Afghanistan, Djibouti and Syria, the users of Strava seem to be almost exclusively foreign military personnel, meaning that bases stand out brightly. In Helmand province, Afghanistan, for instance, the locations of forward operating bases can be clearly seen, glowing white against the black map.\nHelmand province in Afghanistan. Photograph: Strava heatmap\nZooming in on one of the larger bases clearly reveals its internal layout, as mapped out by the tracked jogging routes of numerous soldiers. The base itself is not visible on the satellite views of commercial providers such as Google Maps or Apple’s Maps, yet it can be clearly seen through Strava.\nOutside direct conflict zones, potentially sensitive information can still be gleaned. For instance, a map of Homey Airport, Nevada – the US Air Force base commonly known as Area 51 – records a lone cyclist taking a ride from the base along the west edge of Groom Lake, marked on the heatmap by a thin red line.\nArea 51, with a lone cyclist marked on the map.

Photograph: Strava heatmap\nWhen Strava released the heatmap, an updated version of one it had previously published in 2015, it announced that “this update includes six times more data than before – in total 1 billion activities from all Strava data through September 2017. Our global heatmap is the largest, richest, and most beautiful dataset of its kind. It is a direct visualisation of Strava’s global network of athletes.”\nStrava demonstrated that the new heatmap was detailed enough to see kiteboarding in Mexico, to track the route of the Camino de Santiago across northern Spain and to see the sea route of the Ironman triathalon in Kona, Hawaii. Perhaps the closest to the current operational security issues that it noted, however, was the layout of the Burning Man festival in the Nevadan desert. “The unique pentagonal pattern of Burning Man’s pop-up city is forever etched into the Heatmap, thanks to all the runners and cyclists who have used Strava to explore it,” the company wrote.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a GPS privacy breach.

{"num":8,"Time":"Fri 27 Jun 2014 16.57 CEST","Title":"New York taxi details can be extracted from anonymised data, researchers say","Content":"New York City has released data of 173m individual taxi trips – but inadvertently made it \"trivial\" to find the personally identifiable information of every driver in the dataset.\nThe data could let malicious parties work out the home addresses of drivers, uncover their income, and retrace their movements across the city. But even without that, some users worry that the dataset also exposes passenger information to the world – which could reveal personal information about their journey points and times.\nThe trove of information comes from a Freedom of Information request filed by open data activist Chris Whong. In the original release, each record includes the time and location of the pickup and drop off, as well as an anonymised licence number and medallion number, which identifies the driver and taxi respectively. But Vijay Pandurangan, founder of secure password manager Mitro, discovered that the anonymous data was easy to restore to its original, personally identifiable format.\n\"These data are a veritable trove for people who love cities, transit, and data visualisation,\" Pandurangan wrote. \"But there’s a big problem: the personally identifiable information (the driver’s licence number and taxi number) hasn’t been anonymised properly — what’s worse, it’s trivial to undo, and with other publicly available data, one can even figure out which person drove each trip.\"\nPanduragan realised that the medallion and licence numbers both have a very specific format. Medallions only take one of three formats – either 5X55, XX555 or XXX555 – while licences are all six-digit or seven-digit numbers starting with a five. That means that there are only 2m possible license numbers, and 22m possible medallion numbers.\nThat let Panduragan reverse-engineer the anonymised data to find out which trips were carried out by which drivers, and in which taxis. The data had been anonymised by hashing, a cryptographic function which is supposed to be \"one-way\": it's very easy to find the hash of a given piece of data, and very hard – mathematically impossible, in theory – to find the piece of data which resulted in a given hash (for instance, the MD5 hash, the particular type used by NYC, of the data \"Alex\" is a08372b70196c21a9229cf04db6b7ceb). As the same piece of data always results in the same hash, such functions are frequently used to anonymise just this sort of data.\nBut once Panduragan had narrowed the possible entries down to 24m different numbers, it was the matter of only minutes to determine which numbers were associated with which pieces of anonymised data.\n\"Modern computers are fast: so fast that computing the 24m hashes took less than two minutes,\" he said. \"It took a while longer to de-anonymise the entire dataset, but… [I] had it done within an hour.\n\"There’s a ton of resources on NYC Taxi and Limousine commission, including a mapping from licence number to driver name, and a way to look up owners of medallions. I haven’t linked them here but it’s easy to find using a quick Google search… This anonymisation is so poor that anyone could, with less than two hours work, figure which driver drove every single trip in this entire dataset. It would even be easy to calculate drivers' gross income or infer where they live.\"\nPaduragan points out that there are a number of ways that the city could have more successfully anonymised the data. The first is if they hadn't tried to be so smart: rather than going through the effort of hashing the data, if they had simply assigned random numbers to each licence plate, it would have been much more difficult to work backwards. New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission was asked for comment, but didn't respond by publication time.\nBut in an update to his initial post on Medium, he says that there may be little the city could have done to fully guard against some data being de-anonymised. Citing a similar case where Netflix released a large quantity of anonymised data, which was then de-anonymised, he says that \"there are a number of other ways in which [personally identifiable information] may be reconstructed … NYC is dense enough that it may be much more challenging to target specific passengers using these data, however.\n\"Anonymising data is really hard.\"\nIn Netflix's case, in 2006 the company released the movie ratings of 500,000 customers in an effort to encourage better recommendation algorithms. Unlike the NYC data, there was no way to reverse engineer identifiable information from the dataset itself. But what two researchers realised is that some users were likely to rate movies similarly on Netflix and IMDB. What's more, they are likely to rate the same movies at the same time, which made it possible to link an anonymised entry in the Netflix dataset with a very identifiable user on IMDB – even if the IMDB ratings don't include more sensitive movies which the user may not have wanted to make public.\nFor instance, the researchers said, a user's \"political orientation may be revealed by his strong opinions about Power and Terror: Noam Chomsky in Our Times and Fahrenheit 9\/11, and his religious views by his ratings on Jesus of Nazareth and The Gospel of John.\" Eventually, the revelations led to a 2009 lawsuit from an in-the-closet lesbian mother, who sued Netflix for privacy violation.\nThe Netflix experience raises a further question: how much more information can be deanonymised from the taxi data set? \"I think there's a much bigger privacy issue here than what the author focuses on,\" says one commenter on Hacker News.\n\"Couldn't you deduce many passenger identities based on addresses? There's a lot of scenarios where passenger identities could be effectively de-anonymised, just based on GPS data. You could then use this data set to analyse their comings and goings … can you imagine someone just plotting all the trips from a single gay bar? Listing off all the connected residential addresses? And not only that, any subsequent trips home from those addresses the next morning?\"\nUber: the smartphone app that is driving London cabbies to distraction","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is about a GPS privacy breach.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week Ford's Jim Farley, global vice-president of marketing and sales, initially claimed the GPS units installed in the company's cars meant the company knew when drivers were speeding and where they weren't.\n\"We know everyone who breaks the law, we know when you're doing it. We have GPS in your car, so we know what you're doing. By the way, we don't supply that data to anyone,\" he told attendees.\nAfter his comments caused a furore Farley said he had “left the wrong impression”. He said in a follow-up statement: “We do not track our customers in their cars without their approval or their consent. The statement I made in my eyes was hypothetical and I want to clear this up.\"\nOn Monday, Foxx told reporters in Detroit that new technologies being developed for cars raised potentially thorny issues. He said: \"The technology that's emerging raises questions, and we're going to be responsive to those questions. But each technology is different, and each application of it is different, and we want to make sure that we're striking the right balance between helping folks be safe but also making sure that their expectations of privacy are also weighed carefully.\"\nSergio Marchionne, the chief executive officer of Chrysler and Fiat, said there were concerns about the data being collected at his company but that it was carefully protected.\n“The more information I get about a particular vehicle and the way in which it performs the better quality car I can manufacture,” he said. “There is a large caveat to this which is the potential misuse of this information. We have been very, very wary,” he said. Marchionne said any data was collected in such a way that no individuals information could be compromised “in any shape or form”.\nFoxx’s comments came after the US government accountability office (GAO) found inconsistencies in the way automakers handle data from car owners, raising fears of privacy breaches. The study looked at information collected by Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan and Toyota as well as navigation device-makers Garmin and TomTom and map and navigation app developers Google and Telenav.\n\"Without clear disclosures about the purposes, consumers may not be able to effectively judge whether the uses of their location data might violate their privacy,\" the report noted. It also criticised the fact that drivers were often not able to delete their data and expressed concern that the data could be used in ways “consumers did not intend or may be vulnerable to unauthorized access”.\nAfter the GAO report was released Minnesota’s senator Al Franken called to on Congress to pass a location-privacy bill. \"Companies providing in-car location services are taking their customers' privacy seriously – but this report shows that Minnesotans and people across the country need much more information about how the data are being collected, what they're being used for, and how they're being shared with third parties,\" Franken said in a statement.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news article discusses concerns about GPS and smartphone car technology's impact on drivers' privacy.

They point out that Meta has put the launch of Threads in the European Union on hold because it’s unclear whether the way the company handles user data and shares it across different platforms, including Threads, will run afoul of impending privacy regulations.\n‘Twitter killer’ Threads app hits 100m sign-ups in less than five days\nRead more\n“Several of the privacy concerns with Threads tie back to Meta’s history of concerning privacy practices,” said Calli Schroeder, senior counsel and global privacy counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic), a digital privacy nonprofit. “I haven’t seen any evidence that Meta is being transparent about what it will do with sensitive personal data or is clearly establishing why it is collecting that data other than ‘because we want to’.”\nThe list of past practices that give experts like Schroeder cause for concern is long. In addition to being under a FTC consent decree because of previous improper collection and use of data in the US, Meta has also been fined for collecting sensitive personal data without obtaining the proper consent under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nThough Threads is a novel entrant to the world of social media platforms, much is already known about how the platform collects, stores and shares user data. That’s because Threads is governed by the same privacy policy and business model as other Meta-owned properties when it comes to what the company can and can’t do with the intimate pieces of information it collects on its users.\nJust like its sister platforms, Instagram and Facebook, Threads can and will collect a great deal of data on its users.\nMeta’s apps receive whatever information users enter, said Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez.\nThat can include sensitive data such as health and fitness information, financial information, location and browsing history, according to the app store entry for Threads.\nSeveral of the privacy concerns with Threads tie back to Meta’s history of concerning privacy practices\nCalli Schroeder of the Electronic Privacy Information Center\nThe platform provides the company with information on what posts users engage with and whom they are following. That includes “the types of content you view or interact with and how you interact with it”, as well as how long and how often you use Threads, according to the Threads privacy policy. In addition to users’ Threads activity, the company’s privacy policy indicates it also has access to GPS location, cameras, photos, IP information, the type of device being used and device signals including “Bluetooth signals, nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons and cell towers”.\nCombined, this information can paint an extremely detailed and intricate map of people’s lives, particularly when taken together with all of the data Meta already collects through Facebook, Instagram and Meta Pixel.\nMeta Pixel, a short piece of code that can be added to websites, tracks and analyzes visitor activity, after which various versions of that data are shared with Meta. For instance, several pharmacies and grocery chains reportedly share sensitive information with Meta and other social platforms through Pixel including whether consumers added Plan B or HIV or pregnancy tests to their carts, according to news website the Markup.\nYou are the product\nMeta’s massive collection of data is geared towards one goal – selling ads. Threads currently doesn’t run ads yet, but it undoubtedly will in the future, experts say. In the meantime, information collected on Threads may be used as part of the larger ecosystem of data Meta uses to serve ads on its other platforms.\n“Meta has not only not changed its business model, it continues to want to do targeted ads, essentially surveillance advertising,” said Carissa Veliz, an associate professor at the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford.\nThe company is trying to collect as much data as possible and trying to continue in the same direction as it has from the very start despite all the scandals\nCarissa Veliz of the University of Oxford\n“To that end, the company is trying to collect as much data as possible and trying to continue in the same direction as it has from the very start despite all the scandals, despite the public backlash, despite warnings from regulators, despite fines. It’s not reimagining its business model to make it a more respectful business model towards users.”\nOne concern, Veliz said, is how sensitive the data is that the company collects. “It can include sexual orientation, race and and ethnicity, biometric data, trade union membership, pregnancy status, politics, religious beliefs. And all these data can potentially be sent to third parties.”\nThose third parties include marketers and law enforcement agencies. Vazquez, the Meta spokesperson, said the company internally filters out sensitive data including health information, sexual orientation and religious views from being used in advertising.\nBut much of that information remains vulnerable to law enforcement requests, of which Meta received nearly 240,000 globally in the second half of 2022. A little more than 64,000 of those law enforcement requests for user data were just in the US.\nIn the US, Meta has recently faced specific scrutiny for its collection and distribution of users’ health data and data that can be used in abortion-related prosecutions following the supreme court’s decision to overhaul federal abortion protections. Last year, a mother and daughter were charged with aiding and seeking an unlawful abortion in Nebraska in part based on Facebook messages Meta shared with local police. In the case of Threads, health information can come in the form of engaging with or sharing posts that might signal if a user sought reproductive care or was pregnant at some point. Even if their profile is private, law enforcement can subpoena Meta for their posts.\nMeta is not alone in collecting and sharing user data – Twitter, TikTok and most other social platforms are guilty of similar levels of information collection and sharing. But Meta has one of the largest suites of apps available to consumers, giving it a clear picture of the daily lives of users that few companies other than Google have access to, experts said.\n“We should absolutely be concerned about the amount of data Meta can hold on individuals,” Schroeder of Epic said. “Not only is this a huge risk for breaches – and Meta has already had and been penalized for several major data breaches in the past – but the data can be used to infer even more information about an individual that they may not voluntarily share.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because it highlights concerns about Meta's Threads app and its extensive data collection practices, which include GPS location information.

It's gone to the wrong person.\nNormally, the worst that can happen is a little embarrassment.\nBut a medical advice body is warning that while trying to use modern technology to contact patients, doctors are sometimes revealing confidential information.\nThe Medical Defence Union, which counts more than 50% of UK hospital doctors and GPs as members, says it is being contacted by medics worried about how to put right such data breaches.\nIn one case a practice sent patients an email reminder for a flu vaccination clinic, but mistakenly pasted the email addresses into the \"To\" rather than the \"Bcc\" - blind copies - box.\nA patient complained that a friend, who had also received the email, had asked her why she was on the list.\nShe was being offered the jab because she had cancer - but she had not wanted her friend to know.\nMost mix-ups occur when senders inadvertently use the To or Cc boxes instead of Bcc, allowing all recipients to see the names and email addresses of everyone on the list.\n'Assumptions'\nThe MDU is issuing advice to doctors about how to send out group emails, and what to do if it goes wrong.\nIts author, Dr Carol Chu, MDU medico-legal adviser, said the organisation had received a significant number of requests for advice from members.\n\"These are breaches of confidence. It shows those in the email group that other individuals are part of that practice, and part of that particular group.\n\"And, while you may not be directly releasing clinical information, it can be possible for people to make assumptions, especially in small communities.\n\"For example, on a flu jab reminder list, you may be on there because you are immunosuppressed, because you have cancer or HIV - or other reasons you don't want people to know about.\"\nShe said practices also used email to contact groups of people with particular conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease.\n\"If a mistake is made in an email to a group of patients about a particular treatment or service, such as an asthma, immunisation or diabetes clinic, doctors run the risk of a triple breach of confidence - by revealing the patient's email address; that the person is a patient; and that they are likely to have a condition that might benefit from the service being offered.\"\nDr Chu added: \"Electronic communication can bring a wealth of benefits to doctors and to patients, however it is not without risks.\"\n'Embrace technology'\nDoctors are at risk of being in breach of both the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications regulations 2003 - and the Information Commissioner would have to be informed.\nA spokesman for the Information Commissioner's office said GP practices, like hospital trusts and local councils had a responsibility to take care of the data they hold.\nHe added: \"Bcc and group emails are a concern. If we find a breach related to Bcc, and particularly if that's caused damage or distress, we would take enforcement action.\"\nKatherine Murphy, chief executive at the Patients Association, said it had received complaints from patients about their GPs' use of texts or emails.\nShe added: \"Whilst we fully recognise that the NHS needs to embrace technology, we do not want to see patient confidentiality compromised as a result.\n\"Every GP practice has a duty to ensure that this does not occur.\"\nMore on this story\nHospital fined after data stolen\nPublished\n1 June 2012\nNHS trust passes on patient data\nPublished\n24 May 2012\nRelated Internet Links\nMedical Defence Union\nPatients Association\nInformation Commissioner\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a potential GPS privacy breach because it discusses a breach of email privacy involving doctors sending emails to patients.

Our modern electronic age means that we all move around with a number of \"signatures\"; we send and receive a variety of signals, all of which can be tracked. And as the episode with the exercise tracker shows, you do not need to be an American or Russian spy to be able to see and analyse these signals.\nRussian troops have been tracked in Ukraine or in Syria by studying their social media interactions or geo-location data from their mobile phone images.\nEach piece of evidence is a fragment, but when added together it could pose a significant risk to security - in this case highlighting the location of formerly secret bases or undisclosed patterns of military activity.\nWhich bases are affected and why?\nThe app is far more popular in the West than elsewhere and major cities are aglow with jogging routines.\nBut in remote areas foreign military bases stand out as isolated \"hotspots\" and the activities of a single jogger can be illuminated on dark backgrounds.\nExercise activities stand out in such countries as Syria, Yemen, Niger, Afghanistan and Djibouti, among others.\nSkip twitter post 3 by Tobias Schneider\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter.

It was about something sensitive involving myself and my children, about a family tragedy,” the woman said.\nThe case has prompted warnings that any doctor in England could abuse their privileged access to private medical records for personal rather than clinical reasons.\nSam Smith, of the health data privacy group MedConfidential, said: “This is an utterly appalling case. It’s an individual problem that the doctor did this. But it’s a systemic problem that they could do it, and that flaws in the way the NHS’s data management systems work meant that any doctor can do something like this to any patient.\n“If you’re registered with the NHS in England, this could happen to you.”\nThe Guardian has chosen not to name either the victim or the doctor, who is a consultant at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge.\nThe woman was initially baffled how the medic had come by very personal information about her, her sister and her children that the doctor had then relayed to her ex-boyfriend in the early stages of his new relationship with the woman last July.\n“The doctor said that she had got it from friends, or from people in her choir or parents at my children’s school. That left my sister and I wondering if some of our close friends had betrayed us as we knew that only a few people knew those details. She had an unhealthy interest in us.”\nThe mystery was solved when at her request Addenbrooke’s gave the woman a detailed audit of all its staff who had accessed her medical records. It showed that the doctor had accessed her medical records seven times during August and September last year. On three occasions, the medic first accessed Epic, Addenbrooke’s own hospital medical records system.\nShe then clicked through to a different records system called GP Connect, which contained detailed notes of conversations her former partner’s new girlfriend had had with her GP about the painful impact of the tragedy and the health of one of her children.\nOn one occasion, the doctor, whom the woman did not know and had never met, rang the victim, asked her name, gave her name and then hung up. The victim assumed it was a deliberate ploy by the medic to show that she had gained personal information about her. “It’s normal to be jealous when your ex gets together with someone, but the doctor’s behaviour was upsetting.”\nAddenbrooke’s initially denied it was possible for its staff to access GP Connect through Epic. However, in a meeting with the victim Dr John Firth, its deputy medical director, did acknowledge that her full GP records were available. Michelle Ellerbeck, its head of information governance, later emailed the woman to thank her for showing them that it could be done, in case “this enquiry ever comes up again”.\nDr Nicola Byrne, the NHS national data guardian for England, advises it how to keep patients’ information safe and use it properly. She said she was “concerned at the seriousness of the allegations” when the patient wrote to her detailing the unjustified intrusion into her medical history.\nByrne criticised the doctor’s behaviour as “absolutely unacceptable” and sought to reassure patients who may be worried by the incident by stressing that it was the first time she had heard of a medic breaking the rules on the secure handling of a patient’s medical records in order to gather information about them. However, she left open the possibility that others may be doing the same.\n“Breaches of confidentiality are absolutely unacceptable. All clinicians should take their professional duties and obligations very seriously. And, given that no case like [this] has ever come to my attention before, I trust that most do,” Byrne said.\nSign up to First Edition\nFree daily newsletter\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both involved male doctors, one at Addenbrooke’s and the other at a London hospital. In each case, the doctor told a woman on a second date that since they had first met, he had accessed her medical records in order to find out more about her, including health issues she had already mentioned.\n“Both the women were unnerved and unsettled and couldn’t believe it had happened,” Smith said.\nCambridge University hospitals (CUH) NHS trust, which runs Addenbrooke’s, said it had disciplined the consultant but declined to specify what action it had taken, citing the need to protect staff confidentiality.\n“We take the security of our patients’ information very seriously. To maintain confidentiality, we cannot comment on the details of this case. But we can confirm that it was fully investigated in line with the trust’s disciplinary policy and appropriate action taken,” the trust said.\n“We have met with the patient to apologise and discuss their concerns and we are extremely sorry for the distress caused by this incident,” it added in a statement.\nThe woman said she was deeply frustrated that neither the police nor the information commissioner had taken any action after she complained that her right to privacy had been breached and that the doctor had broken data protection laws and also that CUH would not tell her what sanctions it had imposed.\nCambridgeshire constabulary said the woman had reported that she had been harassed. However, “an investigation was conducted and was filed due to lack of evidence”, a spokesperson said. The information commissioner said it had no power to help the woman and that it was CUH, and not her, that the data breach had affected.\nNHS England declined to comment.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to GPS privacy breach.

Victims are typically contacted after their computers are infected, and told they must transfer funds if they want to return the files to their original state.\nSome customers have already reported that Garmin's services appear to be \"partially\" working again.\nEarlier reports claimed that the company had been asked to pay $10m (£7.79m) to get its systems back online.\nTwitter hack: Bitcoin exchange 'blocked 1,000 transactions'\nHow hackers extorted $1.14m from a US university\nPilots who use flyGarmin were unable to download up-to-date aviation databases, which aviation regulators such as the FAA require pilots to have, before they can fly.\nCustomers were also unable to log into Garmin Connect to record and analyse their health and fitness data.\nThere have been many high-profile attacks in recent months, but few victims have been as tight-lipped as Garmin.\nEven now, despite confirmation from many different sources across different newsrooms, the company is choosing not to admit it was ransomware.\nThe big question is whether or not the company paid the blackmailer what is likely to be a multi-million dollar demand.\nIt seems the company has somehow got the decryption key it needs to start bringing services back online.\nAs well as customers and shareholders, the US authorities will be very keen to know what happened.\nMembers of Evil Corp, the criminal group that's suspected of being behind the hack, were indicted in 2019 by the US Treasury.\nMore on this story\nExchange 'blocked 1,000 Twitter hack transactions'\nPublished\n21 July 2020\nHow hackers extorted $1.14m from a US university\nPublished\n29 June 2020","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the JSON-formatted response based on the provided news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": {\n        \"Reason\": \"This news is relevant to a potential GPS privacy breach.\",\n        \"Details\": [\n            \"The news article reports that Garmin, an American GPS and fitness-tracker company, is dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack.\",\n            \"The ransomware attack has disrupted Garmin's online services, which may include GPS-related functionalities.\",\n            \"Some of Garmin's online tools are mentioned to be provided in a 'limited' state, indicating a disruption in their usual services.\",\n            \"The ransomware attack encrypted some of Garmin's systems, which could potentially include GPS data or services.\",\n            \"Although there is no explicit mention of a ransom demand in the statement, the news hints at the possibility of a ransomware attack, which could be relevant to GPS privacy concerns.\",\n            \"The disruption affected various online services, including customer support and customer-facing applications, which might involve sensitive GPS-related information.\",\n            \"Pilots using flyGarmin were unable to download up-to-date aviation databases, which could be related to GPS data integrity and security.\",\n            \"Garmin Connect, used for recording and analyzing health and fitness data, was also affected, potentially involving user location data.\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\nBased on the information provided in the news article, it is relevant to a potential GPS privacy breach due to the ransomware attack on Garmin, which disrupted various online services, including those that might handle GPS-related data and services.

{"num":19,"Time":"Sat 27 May 2023 19.34 CEST","Title":"NHS data breach: trusts shared patient details with Facebook without consent","Content":"NHS trusts are sharing intimate details about patients’ medical conditions, appointments and treatments with Facebook without consent and despite promising never to do so.\nAn Observer investigation has uncovered a covert tracking tool in the websites of 20 NHS trusts which has for years collected browsing information and shared it with the tech giant in a major breach of privacy.\nThe data includes granular details of pages viewed, buttons clicked and keywords searched. It is matched to the user’s IP address – an identifier linked to an individual or household – and in many cases details of their Facebook account.\nInformation extracted by Meta Pixel can be used by Facebook’s parent company, Meta, for its own business purposes – including improving its targeted advertising services.\nRecords of information sent to the firm by NHS websites reveal it includes data which – when linked to an individual – could reveal personal medical details.\nIt was collected from patients who visited hundreds of NHS webpages about HIV, self-harm, gender identity services, sexual health, cancer, children’s treatment and more.\nIt also includes details of when web users clicked buttons to book an appointment, order a repeat prescription, request a referral or to complete an online counselling course. Millions of patients are potentially affected.\nThis weekend, 17 of the 20 NHS trusts that were using Meta Pixel confirmed they had pulled the tracking tool from their websites.\nEight issued apologies to patients. Multiple trusts said they had originally installed the tracking pixels to monitor recruitment or charity campaigns and were not aware that they were sending patient data to Facebook. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is investigating.\nThe Observer can reveal:\nIn one case, Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS trust shared when a user viewed a patient handbook for HIV medication. The name of the drug and the NHS trust were sent to the company along with the user’s IP address and details of their Facebook user ID.\nAlder Hey Children’s trust in Liverpool, sent Facebook details when users visited webpages for sexual development problems, crisis mental health services and eating disorders. It also shared data when users clicked to order repeat prescriptions.\nThe Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust in London shared data with Facebook when users clicked the information page for its gender identity service, which specialises in working with children who have gender dysphoria. Data was also shared when users viewed the webpage for the Portman Clinic, which “offers specialist help with disturbing sexual behaviours”, and clicked for details on how to be referred to the service.\nSurrey and Borders Partnership NHS trust shared data with Facebook when a patient clicked buttons indicating they were under 18, lived in Brighton and wanted to access mental health services.\nOther NHS trusts sent detailed receipts to Facebook when users accessed pages for appointment bookings or completed online self-help courses. Barts Health NHS trust, which serves a population of 2.5 million in London, shared data with Facebook when a user clicked to “cancel or change an appointment” or added a visit to a particular hospital to their itinerary.\nThe Royal Marsden, a specialist cancer centre, sent data on patients requesting referrals, viewing information about private care and browsing pages for particular cancer types.\nA page about sexual development disorders on Alder Hey Children’s Hospital’s website, which shared details of the browsing with Facebook via the Meta Pixel.\nThe findings have caused alarm among privacy experts who said they indicated widespread potential breaches of data protection and patient confidentiality that were “completely unacceptable”.\nInformation sent to the company is likely to include special category health data, which has extra protection in law and is defined as information “about an individual’s past, current or future health status”, including medical conditions, tests and treatment and “any related data which reveals anything about the state of someone’s health”. Using or sharing it without explicit consent or another lawful basis is illegal.\nOnce the data reaches Facebook’s servers, it is not possible to track exactly how it is used. The company says it prohibits organisations from sending it sensitive health information and has filters to weed such data out when it is received by mistake.\nProfessor David Leslie, director of ethics at the Alan Turing Institute, said the transfer of data to third parties by the NHS risked damaging the “delicate relationship of trust” with patients. “Our reasonable expectation when we’re accessing an NHS website is that our data won’t be extracted and shared with third-party commercial entities that could [use it] for targeting ads or linking our personal identities to health conditions,” he said.\nWolfie Christl, a data privacy expert who has investigated the ad tech industry, said: “This should have been stopped by regulators a long time ago. It is irresponsible, even negligent, and it must stop.”\nHe accused Meta of doing too little to monitor what information it was being sent. “Meta says we don’t permit certain types of data being sent to us but they haven’t spent enough on resources to audit this,” Christl said.\nIn most cases, the information sent to Facebook during a test by the Observer was transferred automatically upon loading a website – before the user had selected to “accept” or “decline” cookies – and without explicit consent. Only three of the 20 trusts mentioned Facebook or Meta in their privacy policies at all. Several of the trusts had previously promised patients that their information would not be shared or used for marketing.\nCollectively, the 20 NHS trusts found using the tracking tool serve a population of more than 22 million people in England, stretching from Devon to the Pennines. Some had been using it for several years.\nSurrey and Borders partnership trust shared data with Facebook when a patient clicked buttons indicating they were under 18, lived in Brighton and wanted to access mental health services.\nOne of the trusts that pulled the tracking tool this weekend, Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS trust, had previously said in its privacy policy that “confidential personal information about your health and care … would never be used for marketing purposes without your explicit consent”.\nIn a statement, the trust apologised to patients and said the Meta Pixel had been active on its website in error. “It was installed in relation to a recruitment campaign, and we were not aware that Meta was using this information for marketing purposes,” a spokesperson said. “Immediate action has been taken to remove it.”\nAlder Hey said it asked visitors to its website for permission to use cookies and said patients’ names and addresses had not been shared. It has removed the tracking tool.\nThe Royal Marsden said it regularly reviewed its privacy policies but did not say whether it planned to remove the pixel. Barts said it was removing trackers from its website “following the disclosure that they were being used to extract personal information beyond the purpose for which they were originally installed, which was to measure responses to recruitment advertising campaigns.”\nSeveral said they were unaware of how data would be used and apologised to patients for failing to get consent. Aside from the 17 who pulled or are pulling the tool, Hertfordshire Partnership trust and Royal Marsden said they were investigating the issues internally and only the Tavistock and Portman did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe ICO said it had “noted the findings” and was considering the matter. “People have the right to expect that organisations will handle their information securely and that it will only be used for the purpose they are told,” a spokesperson said.\nRevelations about the NHS use of Meta Pixel come after regulators in the US issued warnings over the use of tracking tools there. Last summer, tech website The Markup exposed their use on the websites of healthcare providers. In December, the Biden administration warned that using tracking pixels to collect patient data without consent was a potential federal law violation.\nSeveral leading US hospitals are currently being sued by their patients over their use of the pixels, which are tiny pieces of code that are invisible during normal browsing.\nMeta is also facing legal action over accusations of knowingly receiving sensitive health information – including from pages within patient portals – and not taking steps to stop it. The plaintiffs claim Meta violated their medical privacy by intercepting “individually identifiable health information” from its partner websites and “monetising” it.\nJeffrey Koncius, a partner at Kiesel Law in California and one of the attorneys leading the action, said the data transfer by the NHS websites appeared similar to what was happening in the US. “Imagine if a hospital sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg and said, ‘We want you to know that Jeff Koncius is our patient,’” he said. “That’s exactly what’s happening here. It’s just happening electronically.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about a significant breach of GPS privacy.

{"num":29,"Time":"Fri 5 Feb 2016 13.00 CET","Title":"Meet Joe Simitian, Silicon Valley's surveillance technology watchdog","Content":"O\nne of the broadest pushes to reel in America’s surveillance state isn’t in Congress, the White House or a courtroom; arguably it’s in Joe Simitian’s office in California’s Santa Clara County government building.\nSimitian – 63 and bespectacled - is a supervisor on the county board here. This winter he drafted a proposal for regulation that would require local law enforcement to justify each time they use any piece of surveillance technology – fake cellphone towers, computer hacks, license plate readers, GPS trackers, or anything else that helps cops track civilians.\nThe police aren’t his biggest fans. Simitian has spent the past year trying to slow the sheriff’s purchase of new gadgets, and describes the relationship as having a “healthy tension”.\n“I am perpetually the guy at our board meetings saying, ‘I just want to be mindful of …’” he told the Guardian. “People talk about the importance of constitutional rights, but somehow this one just seems to have taken a back seat to others.”\nPrivacy advocates say the Santa Clara regulation would be one of the broadest anti-surveillance measures being considered anywhere in the US. As Washington remains deadlocked over how to put a leash on an ever-growing list of surveillance technology used by state and local police departments, it will probably be up to city councils and county boards to play watchdog.\nThat can be a daunting task for local politicians who often have little technical experience and are more focused on dangerous intersections and village planning.\nBased in Silicon Valley, Simitian might be a special case. He’s been close to technology since his mother helped program computers with punched cards. At one point she worked at North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs. He also has an interest in non-parochial issues. The bookshelf in his office includes treatises on recent foreign conflicts – With The Contras – and most of the autobiographies to come out of the Bush and Obama administrations.\nIf privacy is a passion, he doesn’t show it verbally. In conversation and at board meetings he speaks in a steady, even cadence. He’s also prone to unprompted anecdotes.\nLike this one: just before he joined the state assembly in 2000, an employee at the local Microsoft campus asked him for his thoughts on privacy legislation. Simitian said his first response was that he thought that was something handled by Washington DC. The room laughed.\nSince then, his policy efforts have donned a tin foil hat.\nIn 2001, he introduced what would become the first data breach disclosure law in the US where if hackers steal a company’s data, the firm has to notify affected consumers. Since then, 46 states have followed suit.\nGoogle was affected by his 2003 law that requires companies that collect personal data to clearly post a privacy policy. And thanks to him, California in 2008 became one of four states to outlaw the mandatory implantation of a radio frequency identity chip under someone’s skin.\nAs he paged over a binder of county documents and news clippings related to privacy, Simitian acknowledged, “these issues seem a little abstract when you’re in the middle of a recession”.\n'We will be torn apart': the battle to save Silicon Valley's oldest trailer park\nRead more\nBut he said that someone has to remain on guard. If the electorate waits to care about privacy only after it’s gone, it’s probably too late, he said.\n“This is not something that happens overnight,” Simitian said. “This is a steady drip of the erosion of the right to privacy.”\nHis efforts come as Congress and states have moved to regulate specific electronic surveillance methods, such as aerial drones, bulk telephone record collection, and devices that impersonate a cell tower to intercept calls.\nBut making laws takes a lot of time, and as new bits of spy kit continuously show up it can be hard to keep pace.\nSo Simitian’s draft ordinance would require the local sheriff or any county agency to get board approval if it wants to buy any new piece of surveillance technology or use an existing system in a new way. This applies to any “technological tool used, designed or primarily intended to collect … information specifically associated with, or capable of being associated with, any individual or group”.\nThe sheriff would then have to provide details for a public report that would explain what the technology is and how it would be used.\nIn Silicon Valley speak, the statute is, theoretically, future-proof.\nLaw enforcement also says it is overly burdensome.\n“We want to be careful about tying the hands of police officers who are just trying to solve crimes and protect people,” said the Santa Clara County district attorney, Jeffrey Rosen. “It’s not as though we’re in a country where there are no laws about how law enforcement is supposed to act.”\nRosen said he has one-on-one chats with Simitian at least once a month. And he said he genuinely respects him, even if he disagrees. He did, however, note that when he talks with law enforcement counterparts in other cities, they don’t seem to have to debate with a Simitian. In an interview, the district attorney described the county supervisor as “unique”. Even in Santa Clara he can be an anomaly.\nAt a county board meeting last month, Simitian peppered sheriff’s department officials about their request to buy four GPS tracking devices for $3,000 – a small request given the county’s annual budget, and one that was eventually approved.\nBut Simitian had wanted to know what controls would be placed on who had access to data collected by the trackers. The department, which didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, recently had several correctional officers accused of inappropriately accessing a database with inmate data.\nSimitian asked if the sheriff’s department would accept data security advice from a county technology staffer. The sheriff’s department declined. “Captain, we’ve got legal liability as a county for any misuse or abuse of the system,” Simitian told the board.\n“I’m just baffled there isn’t some way you’d be open to stepping up the security of the system.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach as it discusses the efforts of Joe Simitian, a supervisor in Santa Clara County, to regulate the use of surveillance technology, including GPS trackers, by local law enforcement.

{"num":34,"Time":"Mon 29 Jan 2018 11.46 CET","Title":"Strava suggests military users 'opt out' of heatmap as row deepens","Content":"Fitness-tracking company Strava has defended its publication of heatmaps that accidentally reveal sensitive military positions, arguing that the information was already made public by the users who uploaded it.\nFollowing the revelations, militaries around the world are contemplating bans on fitness trackers to prevent future breaches. As well as the location of military bases, the identities of individual service members can also be uncovered, if they are using the service with the default privacy settings.\nThe “global heatmap” shows, in aggregate form, every public activity uploaded to the app over its history. In major cities, it lights up popular running routes, but in less trafficked locales it can highlight areas with an unusually high concentration of connected, exercise-focused individuals – such as active military personnel serving overseas.\nQuick Guide\nStrava fitness app\nShow\nIn a statement, Strava said: “Our global heatmap represents an aggregated and anonymised view of over a billion activities uploaded to our platform. It excludes activities that have been marked as private and user-defined privacy zones.\n“We are committed to helping people better understand our settings to give them control over what they share,” the company said, sharing a blogpost from 2017 which detailed eight things users can do to lock down their privacy on the service, including specifically opting out of the global heatmap by unchecking a box in the settings page.\nStrava added: “We take the safety of our community seriously and are committed to working with military and government officials to address sensitive areas that might appear.”\nWhile the heatmap only shows information in aggregate, Strava’s own website allows users to drill down into the tracked runs to find the names of individuals, as well as the dates they set their personal best times on particular runs.\nWhen applied to military bases, that information can be extremely sensitive. The leaderboard for one 600m stretch outside an airbase in Afghanistan, for instance, reveals the full names of more than 50 service members who were stationed there, and the date they ran that stretch. One of the runners set his personal best on 20 January this year, meaning he is almost certainly still stationed there.\nIn Djibouti’s Chabelley Airport, used as a staging ground for US Air Force drones, three runners have completed a 7km loop of the runway – two in December 2014, and one two years later in August 2016. At least one of them is no longer based there: their running profile shows they were transferred to an air base in Germany in 2016.\nThe Pentagon said on Monday it was reviewing whether it needed to bolster its security protocols. “The Department of Defense takes matters like these very seriously and is reviewing the situation to determine if any additional training or guidance is required,” the Pentagon said in a statement, without directly confirming that U.S. troops had used the fitness trackers.\nThe Australian military said it was considering taking action to prevent further security breaches, according to a report from the Australian Associated Press. Australia Defence Association spokesman Neil James said any devices that record or transmit should be left at home on deployments. “In world war II, all you had to do was censor peoples’ letters so they didn’t inadvertently tell someone at home something they shouldn’t,” he told AAP.\nWorried about Strava? It’s not the only app mapping our every move\nKeza MacDonald\nRead more\nThe US Marines have had clear policies on the use of “personal wearable fitness devices” on base since 2016. Such devices are prohibited “if they contain cellular or wifi, photographic, video capture\/recording, microphone, or audio recording capabilities.” The policy notes that “merely disabling the cellular, camera, or video capability is not sufficient”.\nBut it does allow such devices if they don’t contain those features, and explicitly mentions that devices with bluetooth connectivity and a GPS tracking function may be used on base, and it contains no specific ban on uploading that information. Those features are what allow apps like Strava to create personalised maps of historic activity.\nThe number of sensitive establishments known to be visible on the Strava heatmap continues to grow, as security analysts continue to scour the map.\nIn Pyongyang, North Korea, a popular riverside running route glows brightly – as does the embassy compound in the Munsu-Dong neighbourhood, to the east of the city centre, home of the British, German, Polish and Czech embassies.\nCamp Lemonnier (top right), and a suspected CIA base (bottom left) in Djibouti.

{"num":37,"Time":"Tue 21 Jun 2022 06.00 CEST","Title":"Shadowy Strava users spy on Israeli military with fake routes in bases","Content":"Unidentified operatives have been using the fitness tracking app Strava to spy on members of the Israeli military, tracking their movements across secret bases around the country and potentially observing them as they travel the world on official business.\nBy placing fake running “segments” inside military bases, the operation – the affiliation of which has not been uncovered – was able to keep tabs on individuals who were exercising on the bases, even those who have applied the strongest possible account privacy settings.\nIn one example seen by the Guardian, a user running on a top-secret base thought to have links to the Israeli nuclear programme could be tracked across other military bases and to a foreign country.\nThe surveillance campaign was discovered by the Israeli open-source intelligence outfit FakeReporter. The group’s executive director, Achiya Schatz, said: “We contacted the Israeli security forces as soon as we became aware of this security breach. After receiving approval from the security forces to proceed, FakeReporter contacted Strava, and they formed a senior team to address the issue.”\nStrava’s tracking tools are designed to allow anyone to define and compete over “segments”, short sections of a run or bike ride that may be regularly raced over, like a long uphill climb on a popular cycling route or a single circuit of a park. Users can define a segment after uploading it from the Strava app, but can also upload GPS recordings from other products or services.\nBut Strava has no way of tracking whether those GPS uploads are legitimate, and allows anyone to define a segment by uploading – even if they may not have been to the place they are tracking. In fact, some uploaded segments are clearly artificially generated, with average paces of hundreds of kilometres an hour, unnaturally straight lines and instant vertical leaps up clifftops all recorded.\nSome of those fake uploads may have been used for the purposes of cheating on friendly competitions, or setting up a segment to guide others: but at least one set appears to have a more malicious purpose. An anonymous user, with their location given as “Boston, Massachusetts”, had set up a series of fake segments across a number of military establishments in Israel, including outposts of the country’s intelligence agencies and highly secure bases thought to be associated with its nuclear programme.\n“By exploiting the capability to upload engineered files, revealing the details of users anywhere in the world, hostile elements have taken one alarming step closer to exploiting a popular app in order to harm the security of citizens and countries alike,” Schatz said.\nThe fake segment approach also bypasses some of Strava’s privacy settings. Users can set their profiles to be only visible to “followers”, which prevents prying eyes from tracking their movements across time. But unless they also set each individual run to be actively secured, then their profile picture, first name, and initial will show up on segments they have run, in the spirit of friendly competition. With enough segments scattered across the map, individuals can still be identified: one user, for instance, tracked their participation in a publicly reported race, which they won, as well as running in secure military establishments.\nIn a statement, the fitness company said: “We take matters of privacy very seriously and have been made aware by an Israeli group, FakeReporter, of a segment issue regarding a specific user account and have taken the necessary steps to remedy this situation.\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST.\n“We provide readily accessible information regarding how information is shared on Strava, and give every athlete the ability to make their own privacy selections. For more information on all of our privacy controls, please visit our privacy centre as we recommend that all athletes take the time to ensure their selections in Strava represent their intended experience.”\nThe discovery has echoes of a scandal from 2018 when a new Strava feature published a visualisation of all activity on the fitness tracking platform across the world. The heat map showed popular running, cycling and swimming routes, and an announcement from Strava highlighted that it could be used to spot locations like the route of the Ironman triathlon in Hawaii. But it also laid out routes that were less public: the location and layout of multiple military bases in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, were clearly visible, as was a popular outdoor swimming spot next to RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands. The map even recorded the route of a lone cyclist in Area 51, Nevada.\nStrava’s response to the uproar was to advise military users to opt out of its visualisation, arguing that the information was made public by the users who uploaded it. In an echo of the latest privacy vulnerability, some users were tracked in alarming detail: one US air force service member could be tracked from a tour in Djibouti, where she ran the 7km loop of the runway, to an airbase in Germany where she was transferred in 2016.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because unidentified operatives have used the fitness tracking app Strava to spy on members of the Israeli military by placing fake running 'segments' inside military bases.

{"num":49,"Time":"Updated 10:06 AM EDT, Sat July 11, 2015","Title":"OPM Director Katherine Archuleta steps down","Content":"Washington\nCNN\n — \nOffice of Personnel Management Director Katherine Archuleta resigned Friday, a day after revealing that the recent data breach of government computers was vastly larger than originally thought.\nArchuleta confirmed her departure in an email to OPM staff.\n“I write to you this afternoon to share that earlier today, I offered and the President accepted my resignation as the Director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,” she wrote. “Leading this agency and serving with all of you has been the highlight of my career.”\nStarting Saturday, Beth Cobert, currently the U.S. chief performance officer and a deputy director at the Office of Management and Budget, will take over as acting director of OPM.\nArchuleta acknowledged Thursday that her agency had discovered in April that hackers had breached sensitive personnel databases and had stolen the personal data of 22.1 million current, former and prospective U.S. government employees and their family members.\nRELATED: OPM government data breach impacted 21.5 million\nSupport for Archuleta crumbled after her testimony. But she had never received a thorough vetting of her qualifications for the job.\nWhen she won Senate confirmation to lead the Office of Personnel Management, the chief objections from lawmakers who voted against her focused on Obamacare.\nThat was October 2013, and the 62-35 vote reflected the political concerns at the time about how the agency, which serves as the federal government’s HR department, would implement parts of the health care law opposed by Republicans.\nIn nominating Archuleta, the President said: “Katherine brings to the Office of Personnel Management broad experience and a deep commitment to recruiting and retaining a world-class workforce for the American people.” The White House announcement listed a series of chief-of-staff and policy jobs in Denver and Washington before her job on the president’s campaign.\nLess attention focused on the agency’s role in handling government security clearances and how it safeguards some of the most sensitive U.S. government databases.\nEven less was paid to why Archuleta – whose most recent job was as a national political director for Obama for America, the President’s reelection campaign – was the person to help fix what was an agency already struggling to deal with technology problems and serious data breaches.\nAides to Republican lawmakers who voted for her confirmation now acknowledge they didn’t pay enough attention to the importance of technology in the agency Archuleta was taking over.\nU.S. investigators believe Chinese government hackers are behind the breach, the worst ever against the U.S. government. Some of the most sensitive security background check data, including information on mental and drug histories of federal job applicants, is now in the hands of Chinese intelligence, according to U.S. authorities.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner on Thursday became the highest-ranking lawmaker to call for Archuleta resignation. He was joined by Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. In recent weeks more than 20 other lawmakers had demanded she be fired.\nCritics now call her a political hack who shouldn’t have the job, even though she got the job with bipartisan support and her political past played little role in her Senate confirmation.\nAdministration officials privately acknowledged Archuleta has performed poorly in hearings and briefings, and that she has made missteps to hurt her own cause. At a recent hearing she was asked if she had met with FBI Director James Comey to discuss the investigation, given the seriousness of the breach. No, was her answer.\nHer briefings for lawmakers have come across as misleading, in part because she stuck by a public estimate that only 4 million people were affected by the breach, even as Comey had told lawmakers the number was nearly five times larger and cited OPM’s own internal data.\nThe White House was saying even Friday morning that President Barack Obama continued to have confidence in her.\nEven before Archuleta took the job, there were signs of trouble at OPM that demanded attention. Internal audits found the agency was woefully behind in meeting security standards for sensitive databases.\nBy the time Archuleta took office, hackers had begun a series of breaches that investigators believe eventually led to the mother lode: the intrusion that began in 2014 and the eventual theft of personal records from two databases.\nArchuleta likely wouldn’t have known about the earlier breaches before taking office. But she knew enough about the agency’s struggles to make this promise in response to written questions provided by senators voting on her nomination: “If confirmed as director of OPM, improved management of OPM’s IT, including proper security and data management, will be one of my top priorities.”\nShe also promised to create a plan within her first 100 days to modernize the agency’s technology and to appoint a chief technology officer focused on the issue.\nShe did make the CTO appointment and, the agency says that Archuleta is responsible for major improvements in OPM’s security. They credit some of those improvements for detecting the latest breach, though it came perhaps up to a year after hackers broke in.\nOPM has identified five major breaches of its computer networks since mid-2012, according to data the agency has provided lawmakers. The first occurred in May, 2012 and involved a critical software system. Investigators later determined that a roadmap for several of OPM’s proprietary software systems was available for some time on an insecure publicly-available website.\nHackers struck the same system again in March 2013. A year later hackers breached a background investigations database. But they had trouble stealing data because OPM’s computer systems were outdated. That breach was discovered in July 2014.\nBy then, the intrusions into separate databases, now at the center of the OPM crisis, had already begun, investigators believe. And this time, hackers succeeded in stealing a trove of data. Late last year, a new breach occurred in an Interior Department database that housed data on behalf of OPM.\nCNN’s Jim Sciutto and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because it discusses a significant data breach involving government computers, specifically the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

This year alone, there have been more than 10 Beidou satellite launches - two more were launched this week. More are planned in what state media describe as a \"period with unprecedentedly intensive launches\".\nImage caption,\nChina aims to have 35 Beidou satellites in orbit by 2020\nBy the end of 2018, it will cover countries along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) - a massive China-led infrastructure and trade programme, part of what it calls the \"Space Silk Road\". Beidou already covers 30 countries involved with the BRI, including Pakistan, Laos and Indonesia.\n\"There is certainly an aspect of this that is about expanding influence, but part of it is likely also about economic security,\" Alexandra Stickings, from the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, tells the BBC.\nA global navigation system that can rival GPS is a big part of China's ambition to be a global leader in space, Ms Stickings says.\n\"The main advantage of having your own system is security of access, in the sense that you are not relying on another country to provide it.

An email has been circulated to about 100 practices across north-east London calling on them to also consider whether the data collection is legitimate, with the hope that it will spread to many more. The email makes clear the refusal to share the data is technically a breach of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.\nPrivacy campaigners and doctors have raised the alarm about plans, led by the Department of Health and Social Care, to put the medical histories of more than 55 million patients into a new database where they will be made available to the private sector and other researchers.\nNHS Digital has said the new General Practice Data for Planning and Research (GPDPR) system will reduce the burden on GP practices and create a valuable data source for pharmaceutical and public policy research. The agency says the data, which will include information on patients’ physical, mental and sexual health, will be pseudonymised.\nThe Guardian view on medical records: NHS data grab needs explaining\nRead more\nBut critics warn pseudonymisation can be easily reversed. And they argue the six weeks between the announcement of the plan and the beginning of collection has not given patients enough time to understand what is happening to their medical records.\nDoctors fear that the automatic transfer of medical records will undermine the trust patients have in them, according to Dr Ameen Kamlana, one of the Tower Hamlets GPs taking part in the action.\n“There’s an immense amount of good that can come from responsible and secure use of public data, public health records,” Kamlana said. “However, our issue here with this particular proposal is that it’s been rushed through. There has been no public information campaign to inform the public about the plans, and in order to allow them to decide for themselves whether they are happy about it.\n“Essentially what’s being asked for here is people’s entire health record, so everything that we’ve coded in people’s records from the time of their birth to the time of their death, including their physical, mental and sexual health, including their health-related concerns with family and work and including their drug and alcohol history.\n“Essentially all your most intimate private details of your life is being asked to be handed over and we were concerned that the public aren’t aware of what’s being done.”\nAn email sent out to about 100 surgeries on Monday night by Dr Osman Bhatti, the chief clinical information officer for the NHS North East London clinical commissioning group, and co-signed by Dr Jackie Applebee, the chair of Tower Hamlets local medical committee, called on doctors to withhold data until they are satisfied patients have had enough time to consider the plan.\n“NHS Digital have not publicised this in the way that I would have expected,” Bhatti wrote. “If you feel that you have not had enough time to inform your patients and that they have had a reasonable time to object, then this sharing agreement should not be enabled.”\nPatients who want to opt out of the centralisation of their health records have to fill in a form, available on the NHS Digital website, and return it to their GP by 23 June.\nBhatti told the Guardian he expected the email to be circulated to about 270 surgeries. “The aim from this is to buy some time, essentially, to say we need a campaign to make the public aware this is happening with this data,” he said.\n“Ultimately patients may decide: OK that’s fine, I’m not worried about it, or some might say: yeah, I want to object and stop my data being being released. But fundamentally it’s just enabling patients to be aware that this is happening, to make an informed choice, and that there’s no breakdown in patient-doctor relationship going forward.”\nAn NHS Digital spokesperson said: “Patient data is already used every day to plan and improve healthcare services, for research that results in better treatments, and to save lives.\n“We have engaged with doctors, patients, data, privacy and ethics experts to design and build a better system for collecting this data.\n“We have worked with our partners in the GP profession throughout as we developed this improved data collection and will continue to do so.”\nThis article was amended on 4 June 2021.

Picture taken on May 3, 2020. REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi\/Illustration\nThe government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has touted its app, Aarogya Setu, or “Health Bridge,” as a key tool in fighting the deadly coronavirus. With more than 70,000 people already infected, the number of cases in India is expected to exceed China, the origin of the outbreak, within a week.\nLike many apps being rolled out around the world, Aarogya Setu uses Bluetooth signals on smartphones to record when people come in close contact with one another, so that contacts can be quickly alerted when a person tests positive for COVID-19.\nBut the Indian app also uses GPS location data to augment the information gathered via Bluetooth and build a centralized database of the spread of the infection--an approach avoided by most countries for privacy reasons.\nAnd it mimics China’s health QR code system with a feature that rates a person’s likely health status with green, orange or red colours, signifying whether the individual is safe, at high risk or a carrier of the virus.\nOn top of that, the federal government earlier this month made use of the app mandatory for all public and private sector employees returning to work as the world’s biggest lockdown eases--drawing sharp criticism from digital rights’ advocates.\nIt made India the world’s only democratic country to make the use of a contact tracing app mandatory for its citizens, according to Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC).\n“The government is virtually forcing you and taking your data without consent,” said B.N. Srikrishna, a former Supreme Court judge, who led an effort to draft India’s first data-privacy law.\n“Once your fundamental rights are being breached left and right, without anybody to question you, and if the courts are not going to help you, you’re even worse than China.”\nBut the Modi government, which has drawn international criticism for its treatment of the country’s large Muslim minority, is not backing down though.\nThe railway ministry, which is currently running special trains to take migrant workers and others to their home towns, has ordered all passengers to download Aarogya Setu “before commencing their journey”.\nA paramilitary force guarding India’s airports and the metro train stations in capital New Delhi has proposed a similar plan for all passengers, according to Indian media reports.\nA spokesman for the paramilitary CISF said it had made no such recommendations to the government, while the Delhi Metro said it was yet to finalise its plan to resume services.\nAnd in Noida, a hub for smartphone manufacturing on the outskirts of New Delhi, police are using the country’s criminal code to ensure everyone on the road has downloaded the app.\nPRIVACY, SURVEILLANCE CONCERNS\nThe National Informatics Centre (NIC), the government agency which developed Aarogya Setu, is free to share personal data from the app with government departments and public health institutions, according to a circular issued by India’s technology ministry on May 11.\nThe system could be used to create permanent government databases containing sensitive personal information about Indian citizens, said New Delhi-based digital rights group Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF). The IFF also raised a red flag about the NIC’s ability to share anonymised data with Indian universities and research institutions.\n“This demonstrates the incentives for why the government of India has taken a centralised approach,” the IFF said. “It is less about taking the least intrusive measure towards responding to the public health crisis, but more towards maximising the utility of data.”\nIndia’s technology ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCritics, including a French hacker, have called on the government to make the app’s source code public, so that independent researchers can fully understand the technology.\nThe government intends to do that, two senior officials from India’s technology ministry told Reuters, but declined to give a timeline.\nThe technology ministry has previously said that the Aarogya Setu app can help authorities identify virus hot spots and better target health efforts, and that information would be used “only for administering necessary medical interventions”.\nAn official at the government think-tank, NITI Aayog, said last month that the app was a “temporary solution to a temporary problem”, adding that the country may have stumbled across “the initial building block for a India health stack”.\nAADHAR 2.0\nCritics say the government’s approach to the app is reminiscent of the Modi administration’s effort to make Aadhar, a biometric ID system, mandatory for everything from opening a new bank account to getting a mobile phone connection.\nThat push, which also lead to fears of a surveillance state, was reined in by India’s top court in 2018.\nThere are also questions of whether the core Bluetooth contact-tracing functions will work effectively without new technology from Apple AAPL.O and Google GOOGL.O, which many countries are now adopting. The tech giants will not permit apps such as Aarogya Setu, that use GPS and are made mandatory, to use their tools.\nSo far nearly 100 million Indian smartphone users have downloaded the app since its launch in early April. The government on Thursday released a version of the app for roughly 5 million users of the cheap internet-enabled JioPhone. The rollout will soon cover the remaining roughly 95 million JioPhone users.\nBut another 300 million Indians use basic feature phones and do not have access to the Aarogya Setu app.\nFor them, India has launched a toll-free number that connects their devices to the Aarogya Setu platform, allowing them to self-assess for COVID-19 via an interactive voice response system.\nBut the mandatory use of the app could marginalise these people if the rules mean they can’t get on a train to go to work.\n“It’s not just a privacy issue but a human rights issue where you are going to exclude a whole section of the society from accessing transport, from accessing their workplace,” Prasanth Sugathan of SFLC India said.\n“It’s definitely going to be a big problem for them.”\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal.

So far it is not backed by any law,\" he told the newspaper.\nMIT Technology Review's Covid Tracing Tracker lists 25 contact tracing apps from countries around the globe - and there are concerns about some of them too.\nCritics say apps such as China's Health Code system, which records a user's spending history in order to deter them from breaking quarantine, is invasive.\n\"Forcing people to install an app doesn't make a success story. It just means that repression works,\" says French ethical hacker Robert Baptiste, who goes by the name Elliot Alderson.\nWhat are the main concerns about India's app?\nAarogya Setu stores location data and requires constant access to the phone's Bluetooth which, experts say, makes it invasive from a security and privacy viewpoint.\nIn Singapore, for example, the TraceTogether app can be used only by its health ministry to access data. It assures citizens that the data is to be used strictly for disease control and will not be shared with law enforcement agencies for enforcing lockdowns and quarantine.\n\"Aarogya Setu retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure compliance of legal orders and so on,\" says the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights and liberties advocacy group in Delhi.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nAarogya Setu requires constant access to a user's Bluetooth and GPS to collect multiple points of data about a user\nThe app builders, however, insist that at no point does it reveal a user's identity.\n\"Your data is not going to be used for any other purpose. No third party has access to it,\" Mr Singh of MyGov said.\nThe big issue with the app is that it tracks location, which globally has been deemed unnecessary, says Nikhil Pahwa, editor of internet watchdog Medianama.\n\"Any app that tracks who you have been in contact with and your location at all times is a clear violation of privacy.\"\nHe is also worried by the Bluetooth function on the app.\n\"If I'm on the third floor and you are on the fourth floor, it will show that we have met, even though we are on different floors, given that Bluetooth travels through walls. This shows 'false positives' or incorrect data.\"\nWhat are the concerns over privacy?\nThe app allows the authorities to upload the collected information to a government-owned and operated \"server\", which will \"provide data to persons carrying out medical and administrative interventions necessary in relation to Covid-19\".\nThe Software Freedom Law Centre, a consortium of lawyers, technology experts and students, says it is problematic as it means the government can share the data with \"practically anyone it wants\".\nMyGov says \"the app has been built with privacy as a core principle\" and the processing of contact tracing and risk assessment is done in an \"anonymised manner\".\nMr Singh says when you register, the app assigns you a unique \"anonymised\" device ID. All interactions with the government server from your device are done through this ID only and no personal information is exchanged after registration.\nBut experts have raised doubts about the government claim.\nMr Alderson has said there are flaws in the app which make it possible to know who is sick anywhere in India.\n\"Basically, I was able to see if someone was sick at the PMO [prime minister's office] or the Indian parliament. I was able to see if someone was sick in a specific house if I wanted,\" he wrote on his blog.\nAarogya Setu denied any such privacy breach in a statement.\nSorry, we're having trouble displaying this content.\nView original content on Twitter\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\nBut, India has \"a terrible history\" of protecting privacy, says Mr Pahwa, referring to Aadhaar - the world's largest and most controversial biometrics-based identity database.\nCritics have repeatedly warned that the scheme puts personal information at risk and have criticised government efforts to compulsorily link it to bank accounts and mobile phone numbers.\n\"This government has argued that privacy isn't a fundamental right in court,\" Mr Pahwa said. \"We cannot trust it.\"\nIndia's Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that the controversial Aadhaar scheme was constitutional and did not violate the right to privacy.\nAnd the question of transparency?\nUnlike the UK's Covid-19 tracing app, Aarogya Setu is not open source, which means that it cannot be audited for security flaws by independent coders and researchers.\nA senior IT ministry official told a newspaper that the government had not made the source code of Aarogya Setu public because it \"feared that many will point to flaws in it and overburden the staff overseeing the app's development\".\nMr Singh said \"all applications are made open source ultimately and the same is applicable to Aarogya Setu also\".\nCan you beat the system?\nTo register, users have to give their name, gender, travel history, telephone number and location.\n\"People can fill the form incorrectly and the government cannot verify it, so the efficacy of the data is questionable,\" Mr Pahwa told the BBC.\nAccording to a Buzzfeed report, an Indian software engineer had hacked the app to bypass the registration page, and even stopped the app from gathering data through GPS and Bluetooth.\nThe report also mentioned a comment on Reddit suggesting phone wallpaper as a simple workaround to not downloading the app.\n\"The privacy conscious are likely to do this. Those who don't want to be forced to give their data to the government will look for and find workarounds. It could be by using a modified app or a screenshot, people will find ways,\" Mr Pahwa says.\nBut Mr Singh argues that \"if one is staying home and not meeting anyone, it would not matter whether they have the app, or deleted it or switched the Bluetooth off or lied on self-assessment\".\nA SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\nIMPACT: What the virus does to the body\nRECOVERY: How long does it take?\nLOCKDOWN: How can we lift restrictions?\nENDGAME: How do we get out of this mess?\nMore on this story\nHow are Covid-tracing rules changing?\nPublished\n5 August 2021\nIndia replaces ringing tone with virus information\nPublished\n17 March 2020\nShould Indians pay for their own coronavirus tests?\nPublished\n20 April 2020","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because it discusses India's Covid-19 contact tracing app, Aarogya Setu, which uses location data and Bluetooth technology to track users' proximity to Covid-19 positive individuals.\",\n\"The app collects various user data, including location data, gender, travel history, and whether the user is a smoker.\",\n\"It mentions concerns raised by users and experts about data security and privacy, including the invasive nature of the app's constant access to Bluetooth and location data.\",\n\"The news highlights the controversy surrounding the app's mandatory use for government and private sector employees, as well as residents in certain areas.\",\n\"Experts express concerns about the app's ability to track user locations and the potential for data sharing with government-owned servers, which could lead to privacy breaches.\",\n\"There are doubts about the government's claims regarding the anonymization of user data, and security flaws have been reported by ethical hackers.\",\n\"The news also mentions that Aarogya Setu is not open source, which limits independent auditing for security flaws.\",\n\"It discusses the possibility of users finding workarounds to avoid using the app or providing accurate information.\"\n]\n}","From":"bbc.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-52659520","query_name":"updated_file_GPS_privacy_breach.xlsx"}

IDORs can be particularly problematic because, like a row of mailboxes, a bad actor can exploit them sequentially one after the other and access data that they should not be allowed to.\nBecause these vulnerabilities can often be exploited by enumeration, IDORs can be abused “at scale” using automated tools, the advisory warns.\n“While there have been prior open source reports on insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities in web applications, CISA and our partners at the Australian Cyber Security Centre and National Security Agency realized this is a major flaw with too little recognition or understanding within the cyber community. Today’s joint advisory is the first significant advisory on this subject to help organizations protect sensitive data in their systems and push vendors to reduce prevalence of IDOR vulnerabilities and flaws,” James Stanley, CISA Product Development Section Chief, told TechCrunch.\nThe joint advisory notes that IDORs have resulted in major data breaches in the United States and overseas.\nIn recent years, IDORs have resulted in the exposure of thousands of medical documents by a U.S. laboratory giant, a state government website that spilled thousands of taxpayers’ personal information, a college contact-tracing app that leaked COVID-19 vaccination status and a state-backed health app that allowed access to other people’s vaccination data. IDORs also resulted in the mass data spill of hundreds of millions of U.S. mortgage documents, the exposure of the real-time location data of more than a million vehicles from a flawed GPS tracker and the leak of hundreds of thousands of people’s private phone data stolen by a global stalkerware network.\nThe joint advisory says developers should ensure their web apps perform authentication and authorization checks to reduce IDORs, and that software is secure-by-design, a principle promoted by CISA that urges software makers to bake-in security from the beginning and throughout the software development process.\n“Secure-by-design is a fundamental theme in this advisory. Vendors and developers are encouraged to take appropriate steps to provide products that protect their customers’ sensitive data by design and default,” said CISA’s Stanley.\nAustralia’s cyber agency said it continues to observe malicious actors exploiting misconfigured networks.\n“Even a single breach using IDOR vulnerabilities can have a national impact. A malicious actor being able to exfiltrate data could impact critical infrastructure, businesses, government and individuals,” said Patrick Holmes with the Australian Cyber Security Centre.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because it discusses insecure direct object references (IDORs) and their potential for large-scale data breaches.

{"num":57,"Time":"1:39 PM GMT+2•April 3, 2018","Title":"Grindr hit with privacy complaint in Europe over sharing user data","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Leon Neal\n(opens in a new window)\nThe Norwegian Consumer Council has filed a privacy complaint about Grindr, arguing it’s in breach of national and European data protection laws after it emerged the dating app has been sharing personal information about its users with third parties.\nAs we reported earlier, Norwegian research outfit SINTEF analyzed the app’s traffic and found that — if set — a user’s HIV status is included in packets sent to two app optimization firms, Apptimize and Localytics.\nThis data was sent via an encrypted transmission. But users were not informed their HIV status was being shared.\nGrindr has claimed HIV status data is being shared only for testing and platform optimization purposes — and that the third parties in question are “under strict contractual terms that provide for the highest level of confidentiality, data security, and user privacy”.\nBut, in SINTEF’s assessment, it is not strictly necessary to transmit such data for analytics and functionality testing (A\/B testing) purposes.\nLocalytics, one of the third-party services Grindr shares user data with – such as GPS location, HIV status and 'last tested date' (see https:\/\/t.co\/Tq6vdgGa0W) – claims to track app users across 37,000 different apps on 'more than 2.7 billion devices': https:\/\/t.co\/wJnFaO7crc pic.twitter.com\/S4xBIQlM7m\n— Wolfie Christl (@WolfieChristl) April 2, 2018\nAs well as HIV statuses, SINTEF found Grindr transmits a raft of other personal data points to third party ad firms — this time via unencrypted transmissions — namely: precise GPS position, gender, age, “tribe” (aka group-affiliation, e.g. trans, bear), intention (e.g. friends, relationship), ethnicity, relationship status, language and device characteristics.\nThe Council is objecting to both the sharing of highly sensitive HIV statuses and other personal information with third parties without Grindr gaining explicit user consent for the data to be handed off to others.\n“Information about sexual orientation and health status is regarded as sensitive personal data according to European law, and has to be treated with great care. In our opinion, Grindr fails to do so,” said Finn Myrstad, director of digital services at the Council in a statement on its action.\n“We expect the company to ensure that its users receive both the privacy protection and security that they are entitled to. This also applies to how the information is used by Grindr’s service partners.”\nThe Council argues that by transmitting sensitive personal data to third parties for ad purposes this is outside the original purposes for the data collection — thereby constituting a breach of the principle of purpose limitation.\nTo be legal under European law Grindr would need to gain separate and clear consent from users for their personal info to be shared, it argues.\n“If such data sharing is to be in accordance with European law, the service has to obtain a separate and clearly given consent from the user. Grindr, who only mention sharing user data in their privacy policy, does not obtain clear consent,” Myrstad asserts.\nThe Council is basing its complaint on the published report from the technical test by SINTEF (available on Github) and Grindr’s privacy policy, dated August 9, 2017.\nIn the complaint it also takes aim at Grindr for adding what it describes as an “unfortunate” disclaimer to its privacy policy which warns users their personal data may be processed in other countries — “including the United States, where laws regarding Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country”.\n“The Consumer Council regard this disclaimer as unfortunate, especially when Grindr is transferring sensitive personal data about European users. European users of the app have the right to have their personal data protected according to European law,” it writes. “The Consumer Council cannot see that Grindr is registered under the trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement Privacy Shield, which is meant to ensure that personal data that is transferred to the United States is protected in line with European data protection law. The Consumer Council see this as a cause for concern regarding whether the privacy rights of European Grindr users are sufficiently respected.”\nIt also argues Grindr is not gaining sufficient consent from users to their personal data being processed because the app asks for consent to the terms of service as a whole — i.e. “without individual elements being emphasized or singled out”.\n“In the view of the Consumer Council, information about sensitive personal data being shared with third parties should not be hidden away in long terms of service and privacy policies. The Consumer Council cannot see that Grindr fulfill the conditions for gathering an informed and explicitly given consent,” it adds.\nWe’ve reached out to Grindr for comment and will update this story with any response.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a GPS privacy breach.

The researcher said he exploited the bugs to see what data he could get access to. He also reached out to the company on June 17 alerting them of the issues in an attempt to get them to fix the vulnerabilities and protect their users’ data, according to a screenshot of the email he sent and shared with TechCrunch.\nAs of publication, the company has yet to fix the vulnerabilities and did not respond to repeated requests for comment from TechCrunch.\n“Everything’s just too easy to exploit. And that’s irresponsible,” the researcher told TechCrunch. “So my best hope is that they will contact either you or me and fix everything.”\nBecause the vulnerabilities are not fixed, TechCrunch is not identifying the company in order to protect its users, whose data is still at risk. TechCrunch also contacted the company’s web host, which said it would alert the device maker, as well as China’s Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT, in an effort to also alert the company.\nGiven that he wasn’t getting any answers, on August 23 the researcher defaced the company’s homepage in an attempt to warn the company again, as well as its users.\n“The site was disabled by a benevolent third party. [REDACTED] has left the site wide open, allowing any script kiddie to grab any and all customer information. This includes plaintext passwords and contrary to what [REDACTED] has claimed, also shipping addresses. You’re welcome!” the researcher wrote. “If you have paid for a physical unit and now cannot use it, I’m sorry. But there are thousands of people with accounts on here and I could not in good faith leave everything up for grabs.”\nLess than 24 hours later, the company removed the researcher’s warning and restored the website. But the company did not fix the flaws, which remain present and exploitable.\nIn addition to the flaws that allowed him to gain access to the users’ database, the researcher found that the company’s website is also exposing logs of users’ PayPal payments. The logs show the users’ email addresses that they use on PayPal, and the day they made the payment.\nThe company sells a chastity cage for people with a penis that can be linked to an Android app (there is no iPhone app). Using the app, a partner — who could be anywhere in the world — can follow their partners’ movements, given that the device transmits precise GPS coordinates down to a few meters.\nThis is not the first time hackers exploit vulnerabilities in sex toys for men, in particular chastity cages. In 2021, a hacker took control of people’s devices and demanded a ransom.\n“Your cock is mine now,” the hacker told one of the victims, according to a researcher who discovered the hacking campaign at the time.\nThe year before, security researchers had warned the company of serious flaws in its product that could be exploited by malicious hackers.\nOver the years, other than actual data breaches, security researchers have found several security issues in internet-connected sex toys. In 2016, researchers found a bug in a Bluetooth-powered “panty buster,” which allowed anyone to control the sex toy remotely over the internet. In 2017, a smart sex toy maker agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by two women who alleged the company spied on them by collecting and recording “highly intimate and sensitive data” of its users.\nDo you know of any similar hacks or data breaches?

REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo\nThe EU executive’s recommendation came as part of a unified European approach for using technology to combat COVID-19 and after several EU countries rolled out a variety of apps, prompting criticism from data privacy activists.\nDoctors want to be able to identify recent encounters of people diagnosed with the virus to quarantine those potentially infected contacts, and a major question is how to do so while respecting privacy rights. Apple and Alphabet’s Google have proposed one system and are considering how to work with other groups that have overlapping goals and methods.\nTo date, 28 countries around the world have launched contact tracing apps, including 11 European countries, while another 11 are developing apps based on GPS or Bluetooth data, according to an analysis by law firm Linklaters.\nThe European Commission said in a statement that app use should be voluntary and not involve any type of data that pinpoints people’s location.\n“Location data is not necessary nor recommended for the purpose of contact tracing apps, as their goal is not to follow the movements of individuals or to enforce prescriptions,” the Commission document said, citing security and privacy risks.\nPrivacy rights group American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that rather than tracking where a person has gone, apps should use Bluetooth signals exchanged between phones to track encounters.\nApple and Google last week said they would help public health authorities and others develop apps for such Bluetooth-based contact tracing. The two companies will have to grant permission to app developers and health authorities to access the technology.\nWhile Apple and Google’s contact tracing technology itself does not rely on location information, both Google and Apple generally allow app developers to collect location information with the user’s permission.\nThe two companies told Reuters that they still are developing policies on whether to allow contact tracing apps using its new technology to also gather location data.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, told the news arm of Snap Inc in an interview this week that users likely would reject contact tracing apps that collect location data.\nApple and Google declined to comment on Fauci’s remarks.\nAmericans in an early April Pew Research Center survey were sharply divided over government tracking of locations of people who test positive for the virus, with 52% saying it would be acceptable and 48% saying it would be unacceptable.\nAbout two-thirds of a country’s population would need to be involved for contact tracing to be effective, a study by researchers at Oxford University’s Big Data Institute said.\nThe European Commission further said mobile apps should be based on anonymized data and work with other apps in other EU countries.\nIt said public health authorities will assess the effectiveness of such apps by the end of the month, with EU countries expected to share the feedback in May and the EU executive to put out a progress report in June.\n“Strong privacy safeguards are a prerequisite for the uptake of these apps, and therefore their usefulness,” European digital chief Thierry Breton said in a statement.\nBreton said he had held a video conference with Google chief Sundar Pichai and Youtube CEO Susan Wojcicki on Wednesday to discuss their cooperation with Apple to create contact tracing technology.\nGoogle said it was a good meeting and that the joint effort with Apple was designed to be opt-in and to comply with privacy and security standards.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels; Additional reporting by Paresh Dave and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Jane Merriman, David Holmes and Jonathan Oatis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because it discusses the use of location tracking in contact tracing apps during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Guardian did not name the doctor or the woman whose privacy she violated. The GMC is now investigating the consultant’s behaviour.\nResponding to the GMC’s figures, the victim said: “Given how unlikely it is that a patient will discover that their data has been illegitimately accessed, it is highly likely that doctors are accessing patients’ notes more often than the roughly 40 times a year that lead to someone complaining to the GMC.\n“The fact that our most personal data is so widely shared with so few safeguards, I believe puts us all at risk of NHS staff examining our records without good reason.”\nSign up to First Edition\nFree daily newsletter\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sardar alarmed both women by calling them on their mobile phones and coming to their homes.\nLast year the MPTS struck off Dr Monika Ciechanska, a London hospital doctor. The hearing in her case was told that she had accessed, or caused other people to access on her behalf, electronic patient records using other doctors’ accounts so that she could order medical tests.\nThe GMC reiterated that doctors should not access patients’ records without a medical reason. A spokesperson said: “Patients must have confidence that their personal information is protected at all times. Our guidance is clear.

Instead of reporting it, Uber hid evidence of the theft and paid ransom to ensure the data wouldn’t be misused.\n“This is one of the most egregious cases we’ve ever seen in terms of notification; a yearlong delay is just inexcusable,” Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan told The Associated Press. “And we’re not going to put up with companies, Uber or any other company, completely ignoring our laws that require notification of data breaches.”\nUber, whose GPS-tracked drivers pick up riders who summon them from cellphone apps, learned in November 2016 that hackers had accessed personal data, including driver’s license information, for roughly 600,000 Uber drivers in the U.S. The company acknowledged the breach in November 2017, saying it paid $100,000 in ransom for the stolen information to be destroyed.\nThe hack also took the names, email addresses and cellphone numbers of 57 million riders around the world. After significant management changes in the past year, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said the decision by current managers was “the right thing to do.”\n“It embodies the principles by which we are running our business today: transparency, integrity, and accountability,” West said. “An important component of living up to those principles means taking responsibility for past mistakes, learning from them, and moving forward.”\nThe settlement requires Uber to comply with state consumer protection laws safeguarding personal information and to immediately notify authorities in case of a breach; to establish methods to protect user data stored on third-party platforms and create strong password-protection policies. The company also will hire an outside firm to conduct an assessment of Uber’s data security and implement its recommendations.\nWest said the commitments in the settlement coincide with physical and digital safety improvements the company recently announced. Uber hired a longtime in-house counsel for intel as chief its privacy officer and selected a former general counsel to the National Security Agency and director of the National Counterterrorism Center as the company’s chief trust and security officer.\nThe settlement payout will be divided among the states based on the number of drivers each has. Illinois’ share is $8.5 million, said Madigan, who plans to provide $100 to each affected Uber driver in Illinois. The payout was similar to what several other states had estimated.\n___\nO’Connor reported from Springfield, Illinois.

In another involving South Wales police, the name of a woman trying to check if her partner was a child abuser was disclosed to the man. She was trying to use Sarah’s law, which was introduced to provide access to sex offender registers after the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne in 2000 by a convicted sex offender.\nSolicitors and the department for work and pensions were also responsible for data breaches, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said.\nEdwards is calling for data handlers to receive more training and to double-check records and contact details, and for access to information to be further restricted to reduce the risk of harm. Every year, 1.7 million women suffer domestic abuse, according to the crime survey for England and Wales.\n“These families reached out for help to escape unimaginable violence, to protect them from harm and to seek support to move forward from dangerous situations,” Edwards said. “But the very people that they trusted to help, exposed them to further risk.”\nIn one case that triggered a reprimand from the ICO, a woman had approached a subsidiary of the social housing provider Bolton at Home for help escaping her husband, a violent domestic abuser. But a staff member left a voicemail on the alleged abuser’s phone with the woman’s new address even though he did not know she was planning to leave him. The man ended up going to the address.\nIn another incident in South Wales, police told a man with convictions for violence and sexual assault that his parter had applied for information about him under the domestic violence disclosure scheme, introduced after the 2009 murder of Clare Wood by her ex-boyfriend.\nIn the Wakefield council case, it was handling child protection court proceedings when it sent the woman’s partner documents including the address where she lived with her two children, despite her living in fear of the man due to a history of domestic violence. The mother and her children had to be moved into emergency alternative accommodation on the same day as the data breach.\nWakefield, Bolton at Home and South Wales police have all since introduced remedial measures.\n“For victims of domestic abuse, a data breach can be a matter of life or death,” said Jacobs. “There is no room for basic mistakes – all organisations that handle victims’ data must implement proper training, robust processes and regular checking.”\nFarah Nazeer, the chief executive of the domestic abuse charity Women’s Aid, said: “These highly concerning data breaches have undermined women’s safety, had severe consequences for women and children’s lives and show just how urgently public services need to improve their understanding and responses to domestic abuse.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because it discusses data breaches that have put domestic abuse victims' lives at risk by accidentally disclosing their addresses to perpetrators.

Norway isn’t a member of the 27-nation bloc but closely mirrors EU rules.\nGrindr said the agency’s findings related to consent policies from years ago, not its current practices, and that it is considering its next steps, including an appeal.\nThe data watchdog “relies on a series of flawed findings, introduces many untested legal perspectives, and the proposed fine is therefore still entirely out of proportion with those flawed findings,” said Grindr’s chief privacy officer, Shane Wiley.\nIn 2020, Norway’s Consumer Council filed a complaint against Grindr for disclosing information about its users, including GPS locations, IP addresses, ages, gender and their use of the app, to several third parties for marketing purposes. That allowed users to be identified and third parties to potentially share personal information further.\nThe data privacy watchdog said users “were forced to accept the privacy policy in its entirety to use the app” and were not asked specifically if they wanted to allow their data to be shared with third parties “for behavioral advertisement.”\n“Furthermore, the information about the sharing of personal data was not properly communicated to users,” contrary to EU requirements for “valid consent,” the agency said.\nThe Consumer Council’s director of digital policy, Finn Myrstad, said the decision by the Data Protection Authority “sends a strong signal to all companies involved in commercial surveillance.”\nAla Krinickyte with the nonprofit European Center for Digital Rights said “it is astonishing that the DPA has to convince Grindr that its users are LGBT+ and that this fact is not a commodity to be bartered.”\nGrindr said in a statement that “protecting users’ interests and ensuring that we put them in control of their personal data have always been our top priorities.”\n“We have also been proactive in adopting industry-leading privacy positions and tools, like detailed consent flows, granular user privacy controls, and ‘just-in-time’ app notifications,” Wiley said.\n___\nChan reported from London.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a GPS privacy breach.

{"num":69,"Time":"4:05 PM GMT+2•June 2, 2020","Title":"Researchers find exposed data on millions of users of quiz app, TVSmiles","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Thomas Trutschel\/Photothek \/ Getty Images\nTVSmiles, a Berlin-based mobile native advertising app whose users earn digital currency in exchange for engaging with branded content such as quizzes, apps and videos, has suffered a data breach.\nSecurity researcher UpGuard disclosed in a report today that it found an unsecured Amazon S3 bucket online last month — containing personal and device data tied to millions of the app’s users. According to TVSmiles’ marketing material the quiz app has up to three million users.\nThe storage bucket UpGuard found exposed to the Internet contained a 306 GB PostgreSQL database backup with “unencrypted personally identifiable information matched to individual users, profiling insights about users’ interests based on quiz responses, associations to smart devices, and accounts and login details for TVSmiles’ business relationships”, according to its report.\nUpGuard writes that 261 database tables were present in the exposed repository — including a “core_users” table consisting of more than 6.6 million rows. Of the entries that had an email address tied to them UpGuard says it found 901,000 unique emails.\nThe exposed backup file appears to date back to August 2017.\nScreengrab: UpGuard\nAfter UpGuard reported the breach to TVSmiles, in an email sent May 13, the Berlin-based company responded on May 15, writing in an email that the repository “has been immediately secured” (UpGuard says it independently confirmed this).\nTVSmiles co-founder, Gaylord Zach, added in this email to UpGuard that it would “further investigate the contents of the exposed data to take further actions”.\nReached for comment on the incident today, Zach confirmed UpGuard’s report and also confirmed that the exposed repository had been accidentally left unsecured for years.\nHe said internal analysis of available logs has found no unauthorized access besides UpGuard’s access of the data, adding that TVSmiles has yet to notify users of the incident — but is planning a communication to users within its mobile app and a blog post on its website.  \n“Our analysis has revealed that the data consists of a database backup that was created in 2017 and mistakenly stored in a cloud storage repository provided within the cloud hosting environment,” Zach told us. “Allegedly this backup was created as a safety measure ahead of performed maintenance work. Further investigation revealed three independent but severe policy breaches: 1.) The backup was stored in plain format where all backups should have been encrypted; 2.) The affected repository was provisioned as a code repository and never intended to store data; 3.) The affected repository was intended for private use within the organization and never intended to be publicly available.\n“The very unfortunate combination of these three factors resulted in the long period that this data remained stored without discovery.”\nTVSmiles reported the breach to the German Data protection authorities — filing its report on May 17, per Zach.\nEurope’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires data controllers to report all breaches of personal data that pose a risk to people’s rights and freedoms to a supervisory authority within at least 72 hours of discovery.\n“We are very thankful to UpGuard unveiling this exposure before it has led to material data breaches and harm to our users. We are very much embarrassed by this unnecessary exposure of user data. It is a strong reminder to every developer to do regular security checks and house keeping in order to avoid these incidents,” he added.\nScreengrab: UpGuard\nClicks for data\nTVSmiles’ business participates in a data-fuelled digital ad ecosystem that operates by linking user IDs to devices, digital activity and tracked interests, building individual profiles for the purpose of targeting screen users with advertising.\nHence the interactive content that the TVSmiles quiz app encourages users to engage with — rewarding activity with a proprietary digital currency (called ‘Smiles’) that can be exchanged for discount vouchers on products in its shop or directly for cash — functions both as direct marketing material to drive deeper engage around branded content; and a data harvesting tool in its own right, enabling the business to gather deeper insights on users’ interests which can in turn be monetized via user profiling and ad targeting.\nSuch insights enable TVSmiles to plug into a wider digital advertising ecosystem in which mobile users are profiled and tracked at scale across multiple apps, services and devices in order that targeted ads can follow eyeballs as they go — all powered by the background profiling of people’s digital activity and inferred interests.\nAccording to Crunchbase the quiz app has raised a total of $12.6M in funding since being founded around seven years ago when it was pitching itself as a second screen app for TV viewers. It went on to launch its own ad platform, called Kwizzard, which packages ads into “a native, gamified ad format” — with the aim of luring app users to engage with quiz-based ad campaigns.\nGiven the nature of TVSmiles’ business — and a wider problematic lack of transparency around how the adtech industry functions — this data breach is a fascinating and unnerving glimpse of the breadth and depth of data harvesting that routinely goes on in the background of ad-supported digital services.\nEven an app with a relatively small user base (single digit millions) can be sitting atop a massive repository of tracking data.\nThe online ad industry also continues to face major questions over the legal basis it claims for processing large volumes of personal data under the European Union’s data protection regime.\n A master database plus access tokens\nIn terms of the types of data exposed in this breach, UpGuard said the 306 GB PostgreSQL database backup contained “centralized information” about users of the app, alongside what it describes as “large amounts of internal system and partnership information necessary for any business participating in the modern online advertising ecosystem”.\nTVSmiles’ LinkedIn page reports the app having in excess of 2M users in Germany and the U.K. — per Google’s Play store the TVSmiles app has had in excess of 1M downloads to date, and while Apple’s iOS does not break out a ballpark figure for app downloads a video on the Play Store app page makes reference to 3M users — so it’s possible the 6.6M figure relates to total downloads over the app’s lifetime since launch back in September 2013.\nZach told us that the discrepancy between the user figures is a result of TVSmiles being a much smaller business now than it was in mid 2017 — when it was spending a lot on marketing and had more active users, including as a result of operating in the UK market (which it left in 2018).\n“In general we are now a much smaller organisation compared to 2017,” he added.\nOther tables in the repository were found by UpGuard to contain considerably more entries — such as a “tracking_token” table, with more than 235 million entry rows.\n“A table in this database called “user_core” contained six million rows, with many users having their “country” field marked for other territories throughout Europe, making this data consistent with being a master database for TVSmiles at the time,” it writes in the report. “The user_core table contained fields for email address, fb_user, fb_access_token, first and last name, gender, date of birth, address, phone number, password, and others.”\nUpGuard told us that the user_core table had password hashes filled in for 626,000 of the rows. It said these passwords appear to have been hashed using a type of hashing algorithm that’s known to be vulnerable to brute forcing — the sha256 algorithm — and therefore offers little protection against malicious attackers.\nIt added that it was able to locate three out of three random hashed passwords it checked in publicly available indexes which are easily searchable online — meaning these password hashes had already been reversed (which in turn suggests they may have been used elsewhere before; or else are commonly guessable).\nIt also found Facebook user IDs (“fb_user”) and access tokens (“fb_access_token”) stored in the repository for some of the listed TVSmiles users — presumably for those who used a Facebook account to login to the app.\n“Not all data points were present for all users – for example, the Facebook specific fields would likely only be present for users who had connected with their Facebook identity, and users who had authenticated via Facebook would not inherently need to create a password for the app due to the functionality of that authentication method,” UpGuard suggests.\nThe exposed repository contained more than 312,000 access tokens tied to Facebook IDs, according to its analysis.\nScreengrab: UpGuard\nIt also found a large collection of personal data stored in a table related to end user devices — which it said were linked to tracking tokens, ad IDs and user rewards.\n“A table called “device_core” contains 7.5 million rows tied to physical devices,” UpGuard writes. “These devices have unique device ids, access tokens, and mappings to the user ids of their owners. Those device ids, in turn, are then relevant to a “tracking_token” table consisting of 235 million entry rows.\n“The rows in the tracking_token table include fields such as campaign_id, placement_id, user_payout, and challenge_id, building up a picture of the TVSmiles activity – like which ads and activities users responded to – on each device – which can then be linked back to the user.”\nOther personal data found in the repository includes precise location data — “users’ latitude and longitude” — with a related admin view configured for a database named “full device info”, which UpGuard says highlights “the “tracker_name,” a token value, and the nearest weather station”.\nIt also found a collection of “insights” related to TVSmiles users — listed in the form of “intents, interests, and other psychographic qualities”.\n“These subjects ranged from consumer goods (e.g. books, video games, furniture, and clothing) to the user’s education and more esoteric interests,” the report notes.\nRedacted screengrab: UpGuard\nAs well as storing (unencrypted) personal data attached to millions of users of the TVSmiles app, and hashed passwords for more than half a million of these entries, the exposed repository was found to contain information related to a number of the company’s own business clients — also tied to access tokens.\n“It is reasonable to interpret these names as business clients, who have paid to publish ads on TVSmiles or have access to insights gleaned from end-user app interaction,” UpGuard writes of the “business_clients” table.\n“These business users’ hashed passwords, phone numbers, email addresses, names, and other data points were also present. Conversely, TVSmiles’ own credentials for interacting with vendors necessary to provide the TVSmiles platform, like ad exchanges, fraud detection platforms, and email communication scheduling, were also present.”\nUpGuard suggests that a hacker who stumbled across the unsecured bucket may have been able to use the tokens to gain access to a number of additional services where they could potentially obtain further user data — such as by exporting contact data; accessing or sending mail via a third party service; or reading historic service information and performance metrics.\n“If this database had been located by malicious entities, prior to UpGuard discovering it and sending appropriate notification, the possibility exists that such credentials could have allowed an attacker to impersonate TVSmiles and collect additional information about arbitrary targets from those other platforms and service providers,” it adds.\nZach confirmed the data contained “legacy access tokens” — but said they stem from a deprecated login methodology that had since been replaced with a OAuth based sign on service.\n“The data originates from August 2017. Any contained access tokens would therefore have expired by now,” he told us, saying TVSmiles has not yet notified any business partners on account of seeing “no major risk based on the nature and age of the exposed tokens”.\n“We would however not hesitate to contact and take action if we have underestimated or overseen risks,” he added. \n Questions of consent\nAfter reviewing UpGuard’s report, Wolfie Christl, an EU-based privacy researcher who focuses on adtech and data-driven surveillance, called for EU data protection agencies to launch an immediate investigation.\n“This is a massive data breach. But it is about more than that. It provides a glimpse into an opaque industry consisting of thousands of companies that secretly harvest extensive personal information on millions of people for business purposes,” he told TechCrunch.\n“According to the leaked database, the company has digital profiles on 6M people and 7.5M devices. It seems that they linked names, email addresses and phone numbers to device identifiers, social media accounts, and to all kinds of behavioral data.\n“Data protection authorities in Germany — and perhaps in other European countries — must immediately start an investigation. In addition to the data breach, they must examine whether the company, and its affiliates and partners, processed this extensive amount of personal data in a lawful way. Did they have a legal basis to process it?”\nScreengrab: UpGuard\n“The wider issue is that, two years after the GDPR came into full force, it has still not been enforced in major areas,” Christl added. “We still see large-scale misuse of personal information all over the digital world, from platforms to digital marketing to mobile apps. EU authorities should have acted years ago, they must do so now.”\nIn its privacy policy, TVSmiles states that it only uses app users’ personal data “to the extent that this is legally permissible or you have given your consent… for the purposes of advertising, market research or the needs-based design of our offer” [text translated using Google Translate].\n“We are obtaining user consent to the use of data and have created a dedicated section within our app to obtain consent like location data, advertising identifier, sharing of personal data with advertising partners,” Zach told us on this, adding that consent information is provided to “various advertising and tracking partners” — assuming users agree to be tracked via responses to its consent flows (shown below).\nScreenshots: TVSmiles\nReferences to a number of third party adtech companies can be found in TVSmiles’ repository, per UpGuard, suggesting it was making use of their services for data structuring, enrichment and monetization purposes — including Adex, a data management platform and marketplace whose website touts the “easy selling and purchase of data”; Adjust, a mobile measurement and fraud-prevention firm geared towards mobile marketing; mobile app monetization company, Fyber; and product user behavior analytics platform, Mixpanel.\nAnother interesting component in this story is how TVSmiles’ business straddles the TV and online advertising realms. Its business began, more than half a decade ago, with a firm focus on the notion of being a ‘second screen’ app for TV viewers — including by using audio technology to automatically identify TV ads in order to serve related in-app content. This means it’s forged links with traditional media giants.\nBack in 2014, for instance, it inked a marketing partnership for its app in Austria with European media giant ProSiebenSat.1’s marketing subsidiary, SevenOne Media. At the time ProSiebenSat.1 PULS 4’s MD, Michael Stix, billed the move as a “strategic step” to integrate brand communication on the second screen, lauding the tie-up as a way to offer advertising customers “additional novel touchpoints” for their target group.\nBut the rise of smart TVs and digital sign-ins has paved the way for deeper linking of Internet activity and TV viewing. Especially as traditional mass media giants have been looking for ways to diversify their media businesses, with more competition for viewers’ eyeballs than ever before.\nBehind all these screens a complex mass of adtech pipes is exchanging data linked to individual users — trading IDs and insights to join dots and serve targeted ads. So connected “touchpoints” are now very much integral, not secondary, these days.\nUpGuard found labels (see below screengrab) in the exposed TVSmiles repository that refer to “seven_pass”: Aka a single sign-on solution for all ProSieben.Sat1’s digital services, called 7Pass.\nAn FAQ on TVSmiles’ website confirms TVSmiles users are able to use the 7Pass service to log in to the app.\nScreengrab: UpGuard\nIn its privacy policy, TVSmiles states that “pseudonymized” data of users of the 7Pass login is sent to ProSiebenSat.1 Digital & its affiliates and to other affiliated companies of ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE — including quiz response data.\n“In addition, survey data collected and provided by you via survey cards in the app are also transmitted pseudonymised to ProSiebenSat.1 Digital & Adjacent GmbH and other affiliated companies of ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE in order to enable you to use special quiz cards in the app, bring in more smilies and be able to offer special promotions in cooperation with ProSiebenSat.1,” it adds.\nOf course, much like weak password hashes, “pseudonymised” personal data can be trivially easy to re-identify — such as by unifying tracking IDs.\nAsked about the 7Pass service, Zach said TVSmiles had replaced its legacy user management with ProSiebenSat.1’s digital sign-on service — claiming the main objective was “to leverage a trustworthy well maintained sign-on service by a larger partner and remove the need of self managed credentials and access tokens”. \n“Given the sensitivity of user data and access credentials it seems like a wise choice in light of this case,” he added. \nIn a more recent business development, TVSmiles sold its development division and adtech to a company called PubNative in December 2019. PubNative is a mobile SSP and programmatic ad exchange owned by a German holding company called MGI Media that’s made a large number of media and adtech acquisitions in recent years (as well as being majority owner of free-to-play gamesmaker, Gamigo).\nAt the time of this “acqui-hire” TVSmiles and PubNative suggested an ongoing business partnership. “As we recently branched into Connected TV, PubNative’s advanced tech stack supports our continued growth and allows us to expand our business internationally. Advancements on demand-side business development will be introduced gradually across the entire product line,” said Zach in a press statement at the end of last year.\nAsked about the nature of the business relationship between TVSmiles and PubNative, Zach confirmed it sold “certain people and technology” to PubNative but retained its mobile apps and user base, adding: “No user data has been shared with PubNative and they have no involvement in this case.”\nHowever he confirmed TVSmiles uses advertising technology provided by PubNative. \n“This technology (SDK) is built into the TVSmiles app. Data sharing is limited to those authorized by user consent for advertising use,” he added.\nA static analysis by Exodus suggests the TVSmiles app contains more than 40 trackers — including PubNative’s. This plus the fact the TVSmiles repository was found by UpGuard to be storing precise user location data is interesting in light of a separate report, published in January, by Norway’s Consumer Council (NCC) — which delved into how the adtech industry non-transparently exploits app users’ data.\nThe NCC report identified PubNative as one of the entities receiving GPS data from a number of apps it tested (NB: it did not test the TVSmiles app). The Council found a majority of apps that it did test transmitted data to entities it characterized as “unexpected third parties” — meaning users were not being clearly informed about who was getting their information and what was being done with it, in its view.\nOther SDKs contained in the TVSmiles app, per Exodus and a list of software suppliers in TVSmiles’ privacy policy, include Facebook Ads, Analytics and Places; Google Ads, Analytics, DoubleClick & more; and Twitter MoPub. Also present: A longer list of smaller adtech and mobile marketing\/monetization players, from AdBuddiz to Vungle.\n“Looking through the Exodus report most of these trackers stem from advertising technology that is being used within TVSmiles app,” Zach also told us.

Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who was briefed on the attack.\nChina has called the allegation that it was behind the attack irresponsible. But the experts said that the goal behind the attack is to build a database of federal employees – using the stolen personal information to fool and impersonate government workers – to set up future “insider” attacks. By revealing who has security clearances and at what level, the Chinese may now be able to identify, expose and blackmail U.S. government officials around the world, the experts added.\nThe connection between the hacking attack and the Anthem incident was first reported by The New York Times.\nVIDEO\nFailure to update software behind federal data breach\nThe cybersecurity experts added that some government agencies have not been following the government’s own best practices for cybersecurity, such as updating operating systems with latest protections.\nThe Office of Personnel Management, which is conducting background checks, warned it was urging potential victims to monitor their financial statements and get new credit reports.\nCan Washington keep your data secure?\nFederal employees lash out\nSome federal employees took to Facebook to express their displeasure.\n“Unreal, I don’t have enough money as it is,” Facebook user Shari Saeler posted on the Office of Personnel Management’s page. “Now I have to worry about someone stealing it!”\nRetiree Linda Eleanor Rigby Robbins posted she didn’t know if she was affected.\n“I do not understand why I heard this on the news instead of via letter or email from OPM,” she wrote.\nGeorge Thomas, who works as an analyst at the Smithsonian Institute, said he felt his employer had done its job in trying to keep his personal information safe. But Thomas also said that in the fast-changing world of technology, it can be difficult for employers to stay ahead of hackers and information breaches.\n“It’s an uphill battle,” Thomas said.\nThe breach was initially thought to have affected the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Interior, but government officials said hackers hit nearly every federal government agency.\nAn assessment continues, and it is possible millions more government employees may be affected.\nU.S. investigators: We believe this was China’s work\nU.S. investigators believe they can trace the breach to the Chinese government. The Chinese Foreign Ministry neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in the hack, simply pointing out it too has been a victim of cyberattacks in the past.\n“China itself is also a victim of cyberattacks,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Friday in Beijing. “China resolutely tackles cyberattack activities in all forms.”\nHe added that China would like to have more global cooperation “to build a peaceful and safe, open and collaborative cyberspace.”\nAnd he also called on the United States not to make groundless accusations about China’s involvement “but instead add more trust and cooperating in this field.”\nA spokesman from the Chinese Embassy in Washington late Thursday objected to allegations that the Chinese government may be behind the massive hack.\n“Cyberattacks conducted across countries are hard to track, and therefore the source of attacks is difficult to identify. Jumping to conclusions and making (a) hypothetical accusation is not responsible and counterproductive,” Zhu Haiquan said.\nHow China could have hacked the U.S. government in 10 steps\nEINSTEIN detection system\nEmployees of the legislative and judicial branches and uniformed military personnel were not affected.\nThere are 2.7 million federal executive branch employees. It’s unclear whether the breach affected all of them, along with former employees, or only a portion of them.\nThe federal personnel office learned of the data breach after it began to toughen its cybersecurity defense system. When it discovered malicious activity, authorities used a detection system called EINSTEIN to unearth the information breach in April, the Department of Homeland Security said.\nVIDEO\nHackers steal data from millions of U.S. government employees\nA month later, the federal agency learned sensitive data had been compromised.\nThe FBI is investigating what led to the breach.\n“We take all potential threats to public and private sector systems seriously and will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,” the FBI said in a statement.\nThe federal personnel office said “personally identifiable information” had been breached, though the office didn’t name who might be responsible.\nCybersecurity: How safe are you?\nSenator: The breach is ‘disturbing’\nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, called the breach “disturbing” and said the Office of Personnel Management needs to do a better job securing its information.\n“It is disturbing to learn that hackers could have sensitive personal information on a huge number of current and former federal employees – and, if media reports are correct, that information could be in the hands of China,” Johnson said in a statement. “(The office) says it ‘has undertaken an aggressive effort to update its cybersecurity posture.’ Plainly, it must do a better job, especially given the sensitive nature of the information it holds.”\nU.S. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said hackers are one of the “greatest challenges we face on a daily bases.”\n“It’s clear that a substantial improvement in our cyber databases and defenses is perilously overdue,” Schiff said in a statement. “That’s why the House moved forward on cybersecurity legislation earlier this year, and it’s my hope that this latest incident will spur the Senate to action.”\nAnd former Arkansas governor and 2016 Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee blasted the Obama administration in a statement over what he felt were inadequate precautions taken to protect the personal data of millions of federal workers.\n“What will it take for the White House to do its job? What will it take for the Obama administration to wake up and defend America?” he asked. “The lack of common sense in this White House is beyond breathtaking.”\nAt a press briefing earlier Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, citing the ongoing investigation, declined to discuss specific details about the attack. But he blamed Congress for not doing enough to pass laws that would enhance cybersecurity.\n“We need the United States Congress to come out of the Dark Ages and actually join us here in the 21st century to make sure that we have the kinds of defenses that are necessary to protect a modern computer system,” he said.\nThe worst hacks of all time\nCNN’s Evan Perez, Kevin Wang, Sophie Tatum and Walbert Castillo contributed to this report.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach as it discusses a massive hack that may have stolen the personal information of four million federal employees.

{"num":73,"Time":"Published 2:27 PM EDT, Tue May 14, 2019","Title":"Who is NSO, the company tied to the WhatsApp security breach?","Content":"London\nCNN\n — \nWhatsApp has just pushed a significant update to its 1.5 billion users. That’s because the messaging service has discovered a security flaw that enabled attackers to remotely install spyware, possibly without the target of the surveillance even being aware of it.\nA “select” group of users were targeted by an “advanced cyber actor,” the company said. So who might have been responsible? “The attack has all the hallmarks of a private company reportedly that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems,” the company said.\nTo anyone immersed in the murky world of cybersecurity and surveillance, it was pretty clear who WhatsApp was referring to. A source familiar with the investigation tied the spyware to an Israeli-based security developer called NSO Group.\nWhat is NSO Group?\nNSO is a multi-million-dollar Israeli tech firm that specializes in cyber-surveillance tools. Appropriately for the sphere in which it works, the company prefers to work in the shadows. Its executives rarely talk to the media and it does not say very much about its clients.\nIts flagship product is Pegasus, a powerful piece of malware designed to track a user’s cellphone. The software is able to infect a device after a single click on a link in a fake text message, which then grants complete access to the phone. Data stored on the phone – messages, phone calls and even GPS location data – are visible, allowing NSO’s clients to see where someone is, who they are talking to, and about what.\nNSO Group told CNN on Monday that its technology was licensed only to government agencies, and “for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror.” The company has no role in identifying the targets of its technology, “which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies,” it said in a statement.\nWho uses the NSO Group’s spyware?\nUp to 45 countries use NSO’s Pegasus technology, according to researchers with the Toronto-based Citizen Lab, an academic security research group that investigates digital threats to civil society groups and online freedom of expression.\nAt least six of those countries – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Mexico, Morocco and Kazakhstan – “have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society,” Citizen Lab noted in a report in September.\nShalev Hulio, the CEO of NSO Group, said earlier this year that his company only sells its products to government agencies. “All sales are authorized by Israel’s Defense Ministry and are only made to states and their police and law enforcement organizations” and “only for use fighting terrorism and crime,” Hulio told Yedioth Ahronoth, one of Israel’s largest newspapers.\nHulio defended the firm’s technology, and said that if clients were found to be abusing the software, NSO group could disconnect it – and had done so three times in the past, though he declined to identify who the customers were.\n“I will say with modesty that thousands of people in Europe owe their lives to the hundreds of workers [we have] in Herzliya,” Hulio said, referring to the Israeli town where the company is based. “I reiterate that any use [of our technology] that goes beyond the criteria of saving human lives at risk from crime or terror will prompt our company to take immediate steps, unequivocally and decisively.”\nBut cyber security expert Michael Shaulov told CNN that once the software was sold to a country, NSO Group had little control over what it was used for.\n“Even when [NSO Group sells] the software to specifically the law enforcement agency that specifically bought it, in the case that those guys want to go after what we call illegitimate targets, NSO has no control [over it],” Shaulov said. “They cannot really prevent it.”\nPrevious scandals\nThe firm attracted attention in the aftermath of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi last year, when a friend of the Washington Post journalist claimed that their conversations had been intercepted by Saudi authorities using spyware created by NSO Group.\nOmar Abdulaziz, a Montreal-based activist, had been communicating with Khashoggi via WhatsApp in the year before the journalist was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October. In their private messages, Khashoggi was far more critical of Saudi Arabia than he was in public.\nAbdulaziz is suing NSO Group, accusing it of violating international law by selling its software to oppressive regimes. Researchers at Citizen Lab believe Abdulaziz’s phone was targeted with military-grade spyware developed by NSO Group. “The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,” Abdelaziz told CNN in December. “The guilt is killing me.”\nThe company has denied any involvement in the tracking of the Saudi journalist or his killing.\nWell before Khashoggi’s death, there have been accusations that its technolgy has been used to target journalists and human rights workers. Citizen Lab identified the use of NSO Group spyware in 2016 when it said governments had been able to use fake domains in attempts to disguise themselves as legitimate groups like the Red Cross, news organizations, and large tech companies. At the time, NSO said that it required its clients only to use its tools to combat crime.\nMore recently, Citizen Lab said that two other Saudi dissidents were targeted using NSO tools. One was an activist called Yahya Assiri and the other was a staff member who had been involved in Amnesty International’s work on Saudi Arabia. An Amnesty deputy program director confirmed its technology experts studied the phone in question and found it contained spyware.\nPegasus has put NSO at the center of a series of lawsuits that allege violations of international law.\nOn Tuesday, Amnesty International launched a legal move in Israel that seeks to have NSO Group’s export license revoked. The petition, filed at the District Court of Tel Aviv, argues that by allowing NSO Group to continue selling Pegasus, and thereby threaten the rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion and expression, Israel is in breach of its obligations under human rights law.\nIn its response to the lawsuit, NSO said that it “operates according to the law and adheres to a clear ethical policy that is meant to prevent misuse of its technology,” according to a statement reported by the Jerusalem Post.\n“NSO only licenses its technology to approved government intelligence and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of preventing and fighting crime and terror, according to clear definitions,” it said.\nSeparately, NSO Group flatly rejected Abdulaziz’s allegations in December as “completely unfounded.”\nHow to update your device\nUnlike previous vulnerabilities, this latest attack does not discriminate between types of devices. WhatsApp has released a patch, which is available in an upgrade.\nIf you’re an Apple user, open the App Store on your device and tap open the “Updates” tab along the bottom of the screen. If your version of WhatsApp needs to be updated, you will see it listed in the “Pending” list at the top.\nOn devices running Android, updating is pretty similar. Go to the Google Play Store on your phone and find “My apps & games” in the menu. Find WhatsApp in the “Updates pending” list.\nCNN’s Donie O’Sullivan and Heather Kelly contributed to this report.

Overall, it reported 62 breaches of personal information by staff in 2008-09, 80 in 2009-10 and 45 from January 2010 to January 2011.\nIn its response, NHS Barnet said that in the second and third examples, the teams concerned had reviewed their procedures, including those involving information governance and security. In the first case, the bag was recovered by a member of staff.\nGuardian Healthcare asked all 71 trusts in London (before the formation of primary care trust clusters) to disclose the number of data breaches by employees of personal information, including serious incidents as well as low level breaches over the last three years. By the time of publication, 30 had responded with the requested information.\nChelsea and Westminster hospital foundation trust reported the second highest number of incidents, with 123 data breaches since 2008-09, and the highest annual level, 45, occurring in April 2010 to February 2011. It reported a high level breach in 2008 involving the loss of a memory stick with patient identifiable information, which led to an internal investigation and an investigation by the Metropolitan Police. Another breach at the trust graded \"orange\" involved a member of staff finding five sets of patients' notes in a bin visible to the ward corridor. Most of the incidents were considered 'low level', however.\nCamden and Islington foundation trust came third in the list, with 72 breaches since 2008-09, followed by Barking, Havering and Redbridge hospitals trust with 68 breaches, of which seven were classed as serious. One data breach involved the theft of a doctor's personal unencrypted laptop, which contained patient information. The trust said that the laptop was password protected.\nAt the time of receiving responses, the Royal National Orthopaedic trust, NHS Croydon and NHS Havering said that there had been no data breaches at their organisations since 2008.\nUnder government guidelines, trusts must declare any serious patient data or breach of confidentiality in their annual report, but they do not have to disclose low level breaches. Outside of the 30 trusts that released figures to Guardian Healthcare, eight more responded with just a link to their annual reports.\nTrusts are required to report any data breach deemed serious to the relevant strategic health authority and then the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The central government watchdog has the power to issue fines of up to £500,000 for breaches of the Data Protection Act. In June 2010 the ICO disclosed that the NHS was the top sector for data losses, with 305 incidents reported to the organisation since November 2007, beating levels in the private sector and local government.\nAnalysis: The biggest threat to NHS data security: its staff\nData: Personal data breaches by London NHS trusts, 2008-11\n\nCorrection: This article has been corrected to make clear that the total number of data breaches of personal information by trusts stands at 899, not 909 as was originally specified.\nThis article is published by Guardian Professional.

So when are you going to get on top of this situation?”\nSimon Stevens, the NHS’s chief executive, replied: “This should be wrapped up by the end of March. End of March is a feasible goal.”\nNHS officials told the committee that of the original missing files, they sent 5,562 cases for clinical review. Of those, 4,565 have been completed – 3,624 of which have shown that there was no clinical harm to patients. There are 941 cases still to be cleared, officials said, adding that no one has yet been identified as coming to harm because of the loss.\nThe National Audit Office found that SBS first recognised in January 2014 that patients may have come to harm as a result of what was at the time a fast-rising backlog of undelivered paperwork.\nHowever, despite staff raising concerns, the firm – which is 49.99% owned by the Department of Health – did not alert the department or NHS England until March last year, 26 months later. SBS was then “obstructive and unhelpful” to NHS England in the inquiry it then instigated, the NAO found.\nA review of the health department’s governance arrangements in relation to SBS, undertaken by its own internal auditor, later found it had not taken up two of its three seats on the firm’s board.\nNHS officials and SBS apologised for the lost documents, saying that SBS has paid £4.34m for the loss.\nMeg Hillier, chair of the committee, wrapped up the fraught session by saying that the committee would ask the NAO to look again at the loss of documentation.\nAn NHS England spokesperson said: “These new cases have come to light as a result of our determination to leave no stone unturned and all these documents will be returned to GPs for clinical review where needed within the next 10 weeks.\n“People should be reassured that despite reviewing over 97% of the records that SBS failed to process not a single case of patient harm has been identified.”\nLabour said the disclosure that even more documents had gone missing than first acknowledged was “astonishing”.\nJonathan Ashworth, its shadow health secretary, said: “Hundreds of thousands of patient letters have been lost, and the secretary of state only admitted it had happened because details were leaked. Now we find even more letters went missing than we were originally told.\n“The government’s response has been complacent and evasive. It’s still not clear how much public money has been wasted in this affair or how this private company is going to be held to account. It’s totally unreasonable for Jeremy Hunt to wash his hands of this when more and more details of his department’s failures keep emerging.”\nVince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, demanded that Hunt -- who has already been summoned to the Commons twice over the scandal -- should urgently appear before MPs to update them on the situation.\n“This colossal blunder now turns out to be even worse than previously thought. the safety of thousands of patients has been put at risk due to the incompetence of a single private company and lack of proper oversight. Jeremy Hunt must urgently come before parliament to explain what steps are being taken to ensure this does not happen again.”\nThis article was amended on 17 October 2017.

The changes will allow emergency services more opportunity to apply for a warrant to request location triangulation data from phone companies to find missing people at risk.\nThe current legislation allows disclosure of such information, under section 287 of the act, if emergency services believe “on reasonable grounds that the disclosure or use is reasonably necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of a person”.\nThe changes would remove the “imminent” qualifier – which Rowland said could often be “impossible” to show – and expand the potential to apply for warrants to access GPS data.\n“It means telecommunications companies can disclose information where they have a reasonable belief that disclosure will lesson a serious threat to life,” Rowland said.\nThe expanded data access would not apply to all missing person cases, only those where police believe there is a threat to life.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe changes were spurred by recommendations from the NSW deputy coroner Erin Kennedy, who in September published findings of an inquest into the disappearance of a Sydney man identified as CD.\nThe findings recommended “urgent reform” around the interpretation and operation of section 287, including removing the qualifier of “imminent” threat to life, and changing the requirement of “belief” to “suspicion”.\nThe CD case involved the disappearance of a man experiencing mental health issues. The inquest detailed, in the days after CD’s disappearance, the refusal of a request for triangulation by a senior police officer, who said the case did not meet the threshold of “imminent” harm. That officer said he received up to 20 requests for triangulation each day.\nThe inquest stated there had been a “narrow view” taken of section 287, and that there were “different definitions” of the term “imminent”.\n“Apps track our locations, the concept of privacy has changed considerably, as should the interpretation of the section, and the section itself,” the inquest found.\nKennedy has been approached for comment.\n“These are critical amendments to the Telecommunications Act and associated legislation which could very well save lives,” Rowland said.\nSign up to Afternoon Update\nFree daily newsletter\nOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The attack affected 111 services across the UK.\nMinisters coordinate response after cyber-attack hits NHS 111\nRead more\nThe Information Commissioner’s Office, the data watchdog, confirmed it was aware of the incident, which took place on Thursday 4 August, and was “making inquiries.”\nA leaked internal NHS England document, seen by the Guardian, has disclosed that “a number of NHS services, including NHS 111, some urgent treatment centres and some mental health providers use software that have been taken offline”.\n“This presents a significant challenge to these services,” it added.\nThe paper also warns that fixing the IT problems created by the hack “may take some time”. Even after Advanced brings forward a purported solution, it will take “potentially 10-12 days” for things to return to normal.\nThis is due to needing “to undertake their own assurance, configure their systems and resolve issues that may have been created by the outage”. NHS Digital will also need to approve Advanced’s plan as “safe”, it adds.\nThe memo adds that 111 has a litany of problems after the attack, including:\nThe service taking longer to answer calls.\nHandlers being unable to book a GP appointment, either at a family doctor surgery or access hub.\nBeing unable to book patients slots at a pharmacy, to pick up medicines, or with a dental care provider.\nGP services may get more patients than usual because of the problems arising from the cyber-attack, the document adds, with family doctors being asked to manage patients themselves who they would normally tell to call the advice service.\nIn addition, for staff at GP hubs, “access to patients’ NHS numbers will not be available for the duration of this incident”, because electronic patient records are unavailable.\nHowever, “NHS numbers can be found retrospectively” and “GP access hubs should accept patient referrals with no NHS number”.\nThe NHS Confederation said NHS staff, especially GPs, are expected to face a massive task inputting paper notes and checking in on patients once the disruption is over.\nThe internal NHS England memo said there is “currently no evidence to suggest that patient data has been compromised”. However, it is understood that the security of patient data is still under investigation.\nAlexi Drew, an information security consultant, said the information commissioner’s involvement indicated serious concerns about whether patient data had been taken.\n“If the ICO is involved, they have to think that there is a credible risk that personal data has been stolen,” she said.\nThe Health Service Journal reported on Wednesday that a “system outage” of the Carenotes electronic patient record – an Advanced product – had affected at least nine NHS mental health trusts. Advanced software is used in 36 acute trusts or mental health trusts in England, according to Digital Health Intelligence.\nThe attack has also affected the Advanced Adastra system, which helps 111 administrators dispatch ambulances and is a patient management system for emergency care.\nAn NHS England spokesperson said: “While Advanced has confirmed that the incident impacting their software is ransomware, the NHS has tried and tested contingency plans in place including robust defences to protect our own networks, as we work with the National Cyber Security Centre to fully understand the impact.\n“The public should continue to use NHS services as normal, including NHS 111 for those who are unwell, although some people will face longer waits than usual, as ever if it is an emergency, please call 999.”\nAlan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, said any patient data on the affected Advanced systems would be at risk.\nHe said: “Even if it was ransomware … that doesn’t mean data was not stolen. Ransomware has evolved to not simply encrypt the data on the users’ devices but also to steal the data (the item of real value) and demand a ransom for its safe return\/destruction.”\nAdvanced said it believed it had “contained” the incident but some services could take weeks to recover.\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n“With respect to the NHS,” it said. “We are working with them and the NCSC to validate the additional steps we have taken, at which point the NHS will begin to bring its services back online.\n“For NHS 111 and other urgent care customers, we anticipate this phased process to begin within the next few days.\n“For other NHS customers, our current view is that it will be necessary to maintain existing contingency plans for at least three to four more weeks.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to GPS privacy breach concerns because it discusses a ransomware attack on an NHS software supplier, which has disrupted key health services, including the 111 telephone advice service, GP surgeries, and mental health trusts.

{"num":86,"Time":"6:49 PM GMT+1•January 13, 2021","Title":"Flo gets FTC slap for sharing user data when it promised privacy","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Flo\nThe FTC has reached a settlement with Flo, a period and fertility tracking app with 100 million+ users, over allegations it shared users’ health data with third-party app analytics and marketing services like Facebook despite promising to keep users’ sensitive health data private.\nFlo must obtain an independent review of its privacy practices and obtain app users’ consent before sharing their health information under the terms of the proposed settlement.\nThe action follows a 2019 reports in the Wall Street Journal that conducted an analysis of a number of apps’ data sharing activity.\nIt found the fertility tracking app had informed Facebook of in-app activity — such as when a user was having their period or had informed it of an intention to get pregnant. It did not find any way for Flo users to prevent their health information from being sent to Facebook.\nIn the announcement of a proposed settlement today, the FTC said press coverage of Flo sharing users data with third-party app analytics and marketing firms including Facebook and Google had led to hundreds of complaints.\nThe app only stopped leaking users’ health data following the negative press coverage, it added.\nUnder the FTC settlement terms, Flo is prohibited from misrepresenting the purposes for which it (or entities to whom it discloses data) collect, maintain, use or disclose the data; how much consumers can control these data uses; its compliance with any privacy, security or compliance program; and how it collects, maintains, uses, discloses, deletes or protects users’ personal information. \nFlo must also notify affected users about the disclosure of their personal information and instruct any third party that received users’ health information to destroy that data.\nThe app maker has been contacted for comment. Update: A Flo spokesperson said:\n“At Flo our highest priority is protecting our users’ data which is why we have cooperated fully throughout the FTC’s review of our privacy policy and procedures. \n“We understand that our users place trust in our technology to keep their sensitive information private and the responsibility we have to provide a safe and secure platform for them to use. That’s why it is our policy to provide security measures designed to protect individual user data and privacy rights. We are transparent about our data practices and adhere strictly to all applicable regulations.\n“Our agreement with the FTC is not an admission of any wrongdoing. Rather, it is a settlement to avoid the time and expense of litigation and enables us to decisively put this matter behind us.\n“Flo did not at any time share users’ names, addresses, or birthdays with anyone.  We do not currently, and will not, share any information about our users’ health with any company unless we get their permission.\n“We have a comprehensive privacy framework with a robust set of policies and procedures to safeguard our users’ data which are regularly reviewed both internally and using independent expert auditors.\n“We are glad to have reached an agreement with the FTC and resolved the matter. We will be conducting a compliance review into our policies and procedures as requested as part of the Consent Agreement and providing the FTC with regular updates. We are committed to ensuring that the privacy of our users’ personal health data is absolutely paramount”.\nNo financial penalty is being levied but the FTC’s proposed settlement is noteworthy as it’s the first time the U.S. regulator has ordered notice of a privacy action.\n“Apps that collect, use and share sensitive health information can provide valuable services but consumers need to be able to trust these apps. We are looking closely at whether developers of health apps are keeping their promises and handling sensitive health information responsibly,” said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.\nWhile the settlement received unanimous backing from five commissioners, two — Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter — have issued a joint dissent statement in which they highlight the lack of a finding of a breach of a health breach notification rule that they argue should have applied in this case.\n.@RKSlaughterFTC and I also believe that Flo violated the @FTC Health Breach Notification Rule.\nCongress directed the FTC to protect our sensitive health data through this rule, to complement HIPAA, but the agency has never brought an action under this rule. This should change.\n— Rohit Chopra (@chopraftc) January 13, 2021\n“In our view, the FTC should have charged Flo with violating the Health Breach Notification Rule. Under the rule, Flo was obligated to notify its users after it allegedly shared their health information with Facebook, Google and others without their authorization. Flo did not do so, making the company liable under the rule,” they write.\n“The Health Breach Notification Rule was first issued more than a decade ago, but the explosion in connected health apps make its requirements more important than ever. While we would prefer to see substantive limits on firms’ ability to collect and monetize our personal information, the rule at least ensures that services like Flo need to come clean when they experience privacy or security breaches. Over time, this may induce firms to take greater care in collecting and monetizing our most sensitive information,” they add.\nFlo is by no means the only period tracking app to have attracted attention for leaking user data in recent years.\nA report last year by the Norwegian Consumer Council found fertility\/period tracker apps Clue and MyDays unexpectedly sharing data with adtech giants Facebook and Google, for example.\nDating and fertility apps among those snitching to ‘out of control’ ad tech, report finds\nThat report also found similarly nontransparent data leaking going on across a range of apps, including dating, religious, make-up and kids apps — suggesting widespread breaches of regional data processing laws, which require that for consent to be valid users must be properly informed and given a genuine free choice. Although app makers have so far faced little enforcement for analytics\/marketing-related data leaking in the region.\nIn the U.S. regulatory action around apps hinges on misleading claims — whether about privacy (in Flo’s case) or in relation to the purposes of data processing, as in a separate settlement the FTC put out earlier this week related to cloud storage app Ever.\nFTC settlement with Ever orders data and AIs deleted after facial recognition pivot","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a GPS privacy breach because it involves a period and fertility tracking app called Flo, which allegedly shared users' health data with third-party app analytics and marketing services like Facebook, despite promising to keep users' sensitive health data private.

REUTERS\/Jean-Paul Pelissier\/File Photo\nDigitalisation means electricity networks, emergency services, industry and agriculture are all vulnerable to hacking by criminal gangs for extortion or, for political reasons, by militant groups or foreign states.\nBut ships are also exposed to interference through electronic navigation devices such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and lack the backup systems airliners have to prevent crashes.\nWith 90 percent of world trade transported by vessels, the stakes are high. Gaps in insurance for ship owners and the disruptions that could cause have the potential to drive up both industrial and consumer prices.\nIn a particularly secretive industry, information about the nature of attacks is scarce, which insurance and shipping officials say is an obstacle to mitigating the risk.\nThere is also a gap in provision, because most existing cyber or hull insurance policies will not cover the risk of a navigation system being jammed or physical damage to the ship caused by a hacking attack.\n“Shipping is very vulnerable not just to jamming of their systems but now to spoofing as well,” said professor David Last, strategic advisor to the government-affiliated General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland, referring to devices that can transmit false GPS signals.\nThe most high-profile reported cyber attacks involving shipping so far had wider targets.\nLast year, South Korea said hundreds of fishing vessels had returned early to port after its GPS signals were jammed by North Korea, which denied responsibility, and an earlier hack by drug traffickers diverted containers in Belgium’s Antwerp port.\nOther cases have had a lower profile: U.S. Coast Guard officials have said GPS interference disrupted operations at an undisclosed U.S. port for several hours in 2014 and reported a similar attack at a non-U.S. port, also unnamed, in 2015.\nIn the latter attack, the Coast Guard said affected ships were able to navigate using radar, compasses and landmarks and urged operators to make sure such skills were not lost. It also called for more information-sharing on cyber threats.\nRANSOMWARE\nNorth, a British based international marine mutual liability insurer, said last month there were likely to be gaps in cover as there was little data and risks were not well understood.\nJamie Monck-Mason, executive director for cyber and TMT at insurance broker Willis Towers Watson, said attacks on ships were not covered by the insurance shipowners have traditionally held.\n“Marine hull and cargo policies typically contain a cyber attack exclusion,” he said, while adding that large policyholders could negotiate to have the exclusion removed.\nHowever, an earlier report by North said attempts to cause shipping accidents were rare at the moment. “The risks of this are currently thought to be low for most companies,” it said.\nA veil was lifted on the scale of the wider problem when CSO Alliance, a trade association for maritime security professionals, said a quarter of the ship owners represented at a confidential workshop it had run admitted cyber incidents in the past year.\nShip operator Consolidated Marine Management said in a presentation last month that “ransomware” attacks, where hackers scramble a ship’s computer system and seek a ransom to unscramble it, were one of the main challenges.\n“SILENT” POLICY\nRegulators are also concerned that a “silent” property policy - which neither mentions nor excludes cyber attacks - is not adequate, a problem too for other industries that face cyber attacks on their property such as power plants.\nBritain’s insurance regulator said in November such policies could leave insurers open to large losses from cyber breaches and that policy holders “may find it challenging to understand whether they are covered”.\nThe world's number one container shipping line Maersk MAERSKb.CO acknowledged the cyber risk to its fleet and said it was working to mitigate it. \"We currently see a trend towards the gap in insurance cover being closed,\" it said.\nProducts are emerging from specialist insurer Sciemus Cyber Ltd as well as large insurers such as American International Group Inc(AIG) AIG.N, while reinsurer Munich Re MUVGn.DE is also developing cover.\n“It’s about figuring out how to connect the gap between a property loss and a cyber loss,” said Dieter Berg, head of business development, marine at Munich Re and president of the International Union of Marine Insurers. “This is the process of discussion with the client - where is your exposure?”\nAIG launched a standalone cyber policy last year, CyberEdge Plus, which protects the policyholder from property damage among other issues. It did not immediately respond to a request for pricing comment and has previously declined to discuss pricing.\nSciemus was not immediately available to comment on the cost of its policies. It has said it charges energy utilities about $100,000 for $10 million in data breach insurance and as much as seven times that to cover attacks causing physical damage.\nFollowing an attack on a Ukrainian power plant in 2015, large utility companies have warned of their exposure to cyber risks in annual reports to regulators and that their insurance coverage might not cover all expenses related to an attack.\nThose kind of warnings are largely absent from company reports in the shipping world, which is just waking up to the risks and has tight margins to take into account due to a near decade long industry slump.\nGraeme Charnock, chief financial officer with Peel Ports, which operates Liverpool port among other terminals in the UK and Ireland, said it was going through a risk assessment and would share it with its insurers in due course.\n“To the extent cover is available, it will ultimately come down to how much it costs as measured against the perceived threats.”\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to GPS privacy breach because it highlights the vulnerability of ships to interference through electronic navigation devices, including the Global Positioning System (GPS).

When auditors tried to get access to Virgin Care to check their compliance, they were denied access for several weeks and the company refused to delete the patient data, the BMJ reported.\nRecords about mental health, including children and young people, those with learning disabilities, diagnostic imaging and other confidential patient data was being processed outside the scope of objectives agreed with NHS Digital, at an address that had not been agreed, and without a data sharing contract.\nA spokesperson for Virgin Care said it had “robust data protection in place”.\n“It is outrageous that private companies and university research teams are failing to comply,” said Kingsley Manning, the former chair of NHS Digital. “How is it that these organisations can be so lax with data?”\nThe BMJ’s analysis of NHS Digital audits found that in the past year 33 organisations were audited and each one had breached data sharing agreements. Hundreds more have been found in breach since audits began in 2015.\nGSK was found to be at high risk regarding “compliance, duty of care, confidentiality, and integrity” by NHS Digital’s auditors in December 2021. It had breached the terms of its data sharing agreement with NHS Digital in 10 ways, including allowing four unauthorised GSK data analysts in North America to access the patient data. GSK also processed and stored NHS patient data in locations that had not been declared, according to the BMJ.\nA GSK spokesperson told the Guardian the company had “worked hard” to ensure “all of their recent audit findings have been fully addressed”, adding: “This is reflected by NHS Digital’s decision to reassess GSK’s risk rating as ‘low’.”\nA health research unit at Imperial College London was also deemed high risk in August 2021. Identifiable, sensitive patient data was not encrypted while in transit between the primary datacentre and the back-up site. Two doctoral students were also given unauthorised access to the data supplied by NHS Digital, the BMJ reported. Imperial College London said it “fully accepted” the findings of this audit and had “quickly put in place an action plan to tackle the matters raised”.\nNone of the organisations had their access to NHS Digital’s data curtailed in light of the breaches. NHS Digital said it was working with the organisations to rectify problems.\n“These breaches will damage public trust that data is being handled safely and securely,” said Natalie Banner, the former lead for the Understanding Patient Data initiative hosted by Wellcome. “The current system is failing to protect data adequately and a major policy shift and investment is needed.”\nPhil Booth, coordinator of campaigning group medConfidential, called for real consequences if companies, commissioners and research teams breach their agreements, warning that breaches of data sharing contracts would otherwise be meaningless.\nHe said: “These contractual requirements aren’t just for fun: a single data breach could include sensitive information about millions of patients.”\nAn NHS Digital spokesperson said: “We take our responsibility to safeguard data very seriously and it is only ever shared with organisations that have a legal basis and legitimate need to use it, to improve health and care services, including medical research.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to GPS privacy breach as it discusses breaches of patient data sharing agreements, which involves the mishandling of sensitive patient information.

{"num":91,"Time":"Sun 18 Jul 2021 18.00 CEST","Title":"What is Pegasus spyware and how does it hack phones?","Content":"It is the name for perhaps the most powerful piece of spyware ever developed – certainly by a private company. Once it has wormed its way on to your phone, without you noticing, it can turn it into a 24-hour surveillance device. It can copy messages you send or receive, harvest your photos and record your calls. It might secretly film you through your phone’s camera, or activate the microphone to record your conversations. It can potentially pinpoint where you are, where you’ve been, and who you’ve met.\nPegasus is the hacking software – or spyware – that is developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group. It has the capability to infect billions of phones running either iOS or Android operating systems.\nThe earliest version of Pegasus discovered, which was captured by researchers in 2016, infected phones through what is called spear-phishing – text messages or emails that trick a target into clicking on a malicious link.\nQuick Guide\nWhat is in the Pegasus project data?\nShow\nSince then, however, NSO’s attack capabilities have become more advanced. Pegasus infections can be achieved through so-called “zero-click” attacks, which do not require any interaction from the phone’s owner in order to succeed. These will often exploit “zero-day” vulnerabilities, which are flaws or bugs in an operating system that the mobile phone’s manufacturer does not yet know about and so has not been able to fix.\nIn 2019 WhatsApp revealed that NSO’s software had been used to send malware to more than 1,400 phones by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability. Simply by placing a WhatsApp call to a target device, malicious Pegasus code could be installed on the phone, even if the target never answered the call. More recently NSO has begun exploiting vulnerabilities in Apple’s iMessage software, giving it backdoor access to hundreds of millions of iPhones. Apple says it is continually updating its software to prevent such attacks.\nTechnical understanding of Pegasus, and how to find the evidential breadcrumbs it leaves on a phone after a successful infection, has been improved by research conducted by Claudio Guarnieri, who runs Amnesty International’s Berlin-based Security Lab.\n“Things are becoming a lot more complicated for the targets to notice,” said Guarnieri, who explained that NSO clients had largely abandoned suspicious SMS messages for more subtle zero-click attacks.\n00:04:55\nPegasus: the spyware technology that threatens democracy – video\nFor companies such as NSO, exploiting software that is either installed on devices by default, such as iMessage, or is very widely used, such as WhatsApp, is especially attractive, because it dramatically increases the number of mobile phones Pegasus can successfully attack.\nAs the technical partner of the Pegasus project, an international consortium of media organisations including the Guardian, Amnesty’s lab has discovered traces of successful attacks by Pegasus customers on iPhones running up-to-date versions of Apple’s iOS. The attacks were carried out as recently as July 2021.\nForensic analysis of the phones of victims has also identified evidence suggesting NSO’s constant search for weaknesses may have expanded to other commonplace apps. In some of the cases analysed by Guarnieri and his team, peculiar network traffic relating to Apple’s Photos and Music apps can be seen at the times of the infections, suggesting NSO may have begun leveraging new vulnerabilities.\nWhere neither spear-phishing nor zero-click attacks succeed, Pegasus can also be installed over a wireless transceiver located near a target, or, according to an NSO brochure, simply manually installed if an agent can steal the target’s phone.\nOnce installed on a phone, Pegasus can harvest more or less any information or extract any file. SMS messages, address books, call history, calendars, emails and internet browsing histories can all be exfiltrated.\n“When an iPhone is compromised, it’s done in such a way that allows the attacker to obtain so-called root privileges, or administrative privileges, on the device,” said Guarnieri. “Pegasus can do more than what the owner of the device can do.”\nLawyers for NSO claimed that Amnesty International’s technical report was conjecture, describing it as “a compilation of speculative and baseless assumptions”. However, they did not dispute any of its specific findings or conclusions.\nNSO has invested substantial effort in making its software difficult to detect and Pegasus infections are now very hard to identify. Security researchers suspect more recent versions of Pegasus only ever inhabit the phone’s temporary memory, rather than its hard drive, meaning that once the phone is powered down virtually all trace of the software vanishes.\nOne of the most significant challenges that Pegasus presents to journalists and human rights defenders is the fact that the software exploits undiscovered vulnerabilities, meaning even the most security-conscious mobile phone user cannot prevent an attack.\n“This is a question that gets asked to me pretty much every time we do forensics with somebody: ‘What can I do to stop this happening again?’” said Guarnieri. “The real honest answer is nothing.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is about the Pegasus spyware, which is a powerful piece of spyware that can hack into phones and conduct extensive surveillance.

{"num":98,"Time":"Sat 29 May 1999 02.45 CEST","Title":"Court blocks selling of patient data to drug firms","Content":"A computer company was blocked by the high court yesterday from collecting information about GPs' prescribing habits and selling it to drug companies in a ruling with far-reaching implications.\nSource Informatics Ltd was told by Mr Justice Latham that selling the data, even though it was anonymous, involved \"a breach of patients' confidentiality\". He had been asked by the company, which sought a judicial review, to overturn guidelines from the department of health advising GPs not to agree to the data being collected.\nBut the ruling raises questions about all statistical information derived from confidential notes, including medical research, and the judge gave Source leave to appeal.\nJoe Collier, professor of medicines policy at St George's hospital school of medicine in south London, said the ruling was potentially \"a catastrophe\". It could spell the end of crucial medical tools such as the general practice research database, to which more than 1,000 GPs have contributed anonymised details of their patients and the drugs they have prescribed since 1991. It may even affect the abortion figures collected by the office for national statistics. \"We would lose some of the great resources available in the UK,\" said Professor Collier.\nThe information sold by Source and the company with which it has recently merged, IMS Healthcare, has been collected for some years by pharmacists from the prescriptions patients bring them. The pharmacists, who are either paid or receive free computer equipment for their business, remove all information that could identify the individual patient.\nBut Mr Justice Latham ruled that there could still be a breach of confidentiality because the patient had not agreed with the way the information about the drugs they were prescribed was being used, even though they could not be identified. The data is sold to drug companies who use it to target GPs who may be prescribing drugs made by rival companies.\nThe department of health guidelines, issued in July 1997 to health authorities, advised that there would be a breach of confidence if anonymous patient information were passed on either by doctors or pharmacists.

{"num":94,"Time":"Thu 16 Oct 2014 17.35 CEST","Title":"Revealed: how Whisper app tracks ‘anonymous’ users","Content":"The company behind Whisper, the social media app that promises users anonymity and claims to be “the safest place on the internet”, is tracking the location of its users, including some who have specifically asked not to be followed.\nThe practice of monitoring the whereabouts of Whisper users – including those who have expressly opted out of geolocation services – will alarm users, who are encouraged to disclose intimate details about their private and professional lives.\nWhisper is also sharing information with the US Department of Defense gleaned from smartphones it knows are used from military bases, and developing a version of its app to conform with Chinese censorship laws.\nThe US version of the app, which enables users to publish short messages superimposed over photographs or other images, has attracted millions of users, and is proving especially popular among military personnel who are using the service to make confessions they would be unlikely to publish on Facebook or Twitter.\nCurrently, users of Whisper are publishing as many as 2.6m messages a day. Facebook is reportedly developing its own Whisper-style app for anonymous publishing. The trend toward anonymity in social media has some privacy experts concerned about security.\nApproached for comment last week, Whisper said it “does not follow or track users”. The company added that the suggestion it was monitoring people without their consent, in an apparent breach of its own terms of service, was “not true” and “false”.\nBut on Monday – four days after learning the Guardian intended to publish this story – Whisper rewrote its terms of service; they now explicitly permit the company to establish the broad location of people who have disabled the app’s geolocation feature.\nWhisper has developed an in-house mapping tool that allows its staff to filter and search GPS data, pinpointing messages to within 500 meters of where they were sent.\nThe technology, for example, enables the company to monitor all the geolocated messages sent from the Pentagon and National Security Agency. It also allows Whisper to track an individual user’s movements over time.\nWhen users have turned off their geolocation services, the company also, on a targeted, case-by-case basis, extracts their rough location from IP data emitted by their smartphone.\nThe Guardian witnessed this practice on a three-day visit to the company’s Los Angeles headquarters last month, as part of a trip to explore the possibility of an expanded journalistic relationship with Whisper.\nAfter reviewing Whisper’s back-end tools and speaking extensively with the company’s executives, the Guardian has also established that:\nUser data, including Whisper postings that users believe they have deleted, is collated in a searchable database. The company has no access to users’ names or phone numbers, but is storing information about the precise time and approximate location of all previous messages posted through the app. The data, which stretches back to the app’s launch in 2012, is being stored indefinitely, a practice seemingly at odds with Whisper’s stated policy of holding the data only for “a brief period of time”.\nA team headed by Whisper’s editor-in-chief, Neetzan Zimmerman, is closely monitoring users it believes are potentially newsworthy, delving into the history of their activity on the app and tracking their movements through the mapping tool. Among the many users currently being targeted are military personnel and individuals claiming to work at Yahoo, Disney and on Capitol Hill.\nWhisper’s policy toward sharing user data with law enforcement has prompted it on occasions to provide information to both the FBI and MI5. Both cases involved potentially imminent threats to life, Whisper said, a practice standard in the tech industry. But privacy experts who reviewed Whisper’s terms of service for the Guardian said the company appeared to require a lower legal threshold for providing user information to authorities than other tech companies.\nThe company is cooperating with the US Department of Defense, sharing information with researchers investigating the frequency of mentions of suicide or self-harm from smartphones that Whisper knows are being used from US military bases. Whisper stressed that “specific user data” is not being shared with the DoD, adding that the company was “proudly working with many organisations to lower suicide rates and the US military is among them”.\nWhisper is developing a Chinese version of its app, which received a soft-launch earlier this month. Companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter are banned in mainland China. Whisper executives said they had agreed to the demands China places on tech companies operating in its jurisdiction, including a ban on the use of certain words.\nWhisper’s targeted monitoring of some people who use the app – even some of those who have declared they do not want to be followed by opting out of geolocation – is likely to surprise its users, who are drawn to the app by the bold promises the company makes about their anonymity.\n“Whisper isn’t actually about concealing identity. It’s about a complete absence of identity,” the company’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Heyward, recently told Entrepreneur magazine. “The concept around Whisper is removing the concept of identity altogether, so you’re not as guarded.”\nBrad Brooks, left, and Michael Heyward of Whisper in Santa Monica. Photograph: Ringo Chiu\/Zuma Press\/Corbis\nHe has called Whisper the “safest place on internet” and portrays the app as a secure place in which users should feel free to express their innermost feelings and confessions.\nWhisper, which was recently valued at over $200m, has grown rapidly since its launch two years ago. It is among the fleet of confessional apps, such as Secret and Yik Yak, which backers say enable users to be more candid than they are on other social media platforms.\nTo stamp out inappropriate behaviour, Whisper has an offshore base in the Philippines, where more than 100 employees screen messages 24 hours a day. Whisper described the process as “extremely secure”.\nIn an attempt to promote content posted on the app, Whisper has worked hard to build relationships with news organisations. Its longest-standing partnership is with Buzzfeed, and Whisper’s executives said they are now in discussions with newspapers and TV networks.\nOn Thursday, a Buzzfeed spokesperson said the news outlet is now halting its partnership with Whisper. “We’re taking a break from our partnership until Whisper clarifies to us and its users the policy on user location and privacy,” a spokesperson said.\n\nOver the last year, Whisper has promoted revelations posted by anonymous users about the dismissal of Dov Charney, the founder of American Apparel, and accusations about Gwyneth Paltrow’s private life.\nIn September, Whisper returned to the headlines when an apparently suicidal man in Texas used the app to broadcast messages and photographs from the middle of a standoff with armed police.\nWhisper’s in-house mapping tool identifies users who have posted in the vicinity of the National Security Agency, Maryland, using their GPS data. Occasionally, the company uses IP address location data to establish the rough location of some users who have opted out the app’s geolocation services. Photograph: Guardian\nThe Guardian had previously worked with Whisper to find Iraq war veterans who wanted to share their opinions of Isis, find an undocumented immigrant to write an opinion article and post people’s confessions about Valentine’s Day. At no point during those collaborations did Whisper indicate it was ascertaining the location of individual users who had disabled their geolocation feature.\nThe Guardian visited the Whisper offices to consider the possibility of undertaking other journalistic projects with the company and sent two reporters last month to look in detail at how the app operates. At no stage during the visit were the journalists told they could not report on the information shared with them.\nThe Guardian is no longer pursuing a relationship with Whisper.\nWhisper introduced its optional geolocation feature earlier this year, enabling users to view other people’s messages that have been posted by users within a set-mile radius, known as the “nearby” function. Crucially, the app also contains a button that allows users to opt out of its geolocation service, a facility its terms state is “purely voluntarily”.\nThat system provided Whisper with a hoard of easily analysed location data from those who opted into the service, and the company has become increasingly open with journalists that its in-house technology allows it to locate users. The company now uses geolocation to make judgments about the “veracity” of users posting on the site.\nIn July, during the recent Israeli war in Gaza, Whisper was able to monitor Israeli Defense Force soldiers on the frontline. “We had 13 or 14 soldiers who we were tracking – every whisper they did,” one Whisper executive said during the Guardian’s visit.\nSeparately, Whisper has been following a user claiming to be a sex-obsessed lobbyist in Washington DC. The company’s tracking tools allow staff to monitor which areas of the capital the lobbyist visits. “He’s a guy that we’ll track for the rest of his life and he’ll have no idea we’ll be watching him,” the same Whisper executive said.\nNow the company plans to make its database and a version of its mapping tool available to select journalists in the coming months.\nWhen Guardian reporters visited Whisper last month, Zimmerman and another executive said that when they wanted to establish the location of individual users who are among the 20% who have opted out of geolocation services, they simply asked their technical staff to obtain the “latitude and longitude” of the phones they had used.\nNeetzan Zimmerman, editor-in-chief of Whisper. Photograph: Ringo Chiu\/Zuma Press\/Corbis\nOne of the users that Whisper suggested the Guardian could be interested in researching, for example, claimed to be soldier who could be imminently deployed to Iraq.\nThe user had apparently turned off their geolocation facility, denying the company permission to track them. Yet Whisper was able to ascertain the dates the user had been in Afghanistan and Fort Riley, Kansas.\nWhisper later explained that when it wants to establish the location of users who have disabled their geolocation services, the company uses their IP location.\nOn Thursday last week, the Guardian contacted Whisper, explained it planned to write a story about the company’s internal practices and asked for comment.\nWhisper acknowledged that it researches the location of specific users it believes are posting newsworthy information, but emphasised it typically uses GPS data.\nWhisper stressed the IP location data it uses for people who have asked not to be followed is rough and unreliable.\n“We occasionally look at user IP addresses internally to determine very approximate location,” the company said. “User IP addresses may allow very coarse location to be determined to the city, state or country level.”\nIt added: “Whisper does not request or store any personally identifiable information from users, therefore there is never a breach of anonymity. From time to time, when a user makes a claim of a newsworthy nature, we review the user’s past activity to help determine veracity.”\nThe company strongly rejected any assertion of wrongdoing. “The Guardian’s assumptions that Whisper is gathering information about users and violating user’s privacy are false,” it said. “The privacy of our users is not violated in any of the circumstances suggested in the Guardian story.”\nFour days later, Whisper rewrote large sections of its terms of service and introduced an entirely new privacy policy.\nWhereas the previous terms and conditions described all of Whisper’s tracking of user location as “voluntary”, the new terms now warn users to “bear in mind that, even if you have disabled location services, we may still determine your city, state, and country location”.\nSince becoming aware that the Guardian planned to publish its story, the anonymous app has also inserted a new line into its privacy policy.\nIt now warns users that turning on the app’s geolocation feature may “allow others, over time, to make a determination as to your identity”.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The company behind Whisper, a social media app promising anonymity, is tracking the location of its users, even those who have opted out of geolocation services.\",\n\"Whisper is sharing information with the US Department of Defense and has developed a version of its app to comply with Chinese censorship laws.\",\n\"The company is monitoring geolocated messages sent from military bases, such as the Pentagon and National Security Agency.\",\n\"It can track individual user movements over time and extract rough location data from IP data emitted by smartphones.\",\n\"User data, including deleted Whisper postings, is stored indefinitely, contradicting Whisper's stated policy.\",\n\"Whisper is closely monitoring certain users, including military personnel and individuals from Yahoo, Disney, and Capitol Hill.\",\n\"The company has provided information to the FBI and MI5 with lower legal thresholds than other tech companies.\",\n\"Whisper is cooperating with the US Department of Defense to investigate mentions of suicide or self-harm from smartphones used on military bases.\",\n\"The company is developing a Chinese version of its app that complies with Chinese censorship laws.\",\n\"Whisper's in-house mapping tool allows it to identify and monitor users, even those who have disabled geolocation services.\",\n\"Whisper plans to make its database and mapping tool available to select journalists in the future.\",\n\"Whisper can determine user locations using both GPS data and IP address location data.\",\n\"The company recently updated its terms of service to explicitly allow location tracking even for users who disable geolocation services.\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2014\/oct\/16\/-sp-revealed-whisper-app-tracking-users","query_name":"updated_file_GPS_privacy_breach.xlsx"}

HPE did not say how the hacker obtained the private key, but said the key allowed access to cloud servers in multiple regions where customer data was stored.\nHPE bought Aruba Networks in 2015 for $3 billion in cash. Aruba provides networking gear, like wireless access points, and network security for companies. Through its dashboard, Aruba Central, companies can centrally monitor and manage their Wi-Fi networks.\nIt’s the Wi-Fi data collected in Aruba Central that HPE said was compromised. HPE said two data sets were exposed: one for network analytics containing information about devices accessing a customer’s Wi-Fi network, and a second data set containing location data about devices on the network. HPE did not give more details about the granularity of the exposed location data, but noted that the data “could allow the general vicinity of a user’s location to be determined.”\nSpecifically, the data included details about a device, such as a device’s MAC and IP address, device hostname and operating system and, in some cases, the username of the user accessing a Wi-Fi network. HPE said usernames are chosen by customers but could include a user’s name or an email address.\nWorse, although the data was both scrambled and encrypted, the company said the private key had permission to use the decryption key; it wasn’t clear if the data was ultimately decrypted. HPE said it was likely only a “very small amount, if any” data was exfiltrated. The company added that it wasn’t clear which specific customers or what files were taken because the company does not keep logs of individual file access.\nAccording to a statement, the hacker first used the key on October 9, but HPE did not detect the intrusion until November 2.

Photos and video will often also include the location from where they were taken. That location data helps online services tag your photos or videos that you were at this restaurant or that other landmark.\nBut those online services — especially social platforms, where you see people’s profile photos — are supposed to remove location data from the file’s metadata so other users can’t snoop on where you’ve been, since location data can reveal where you live, where you work, where you go and who you see.\nJan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, found the metadata exposure as part of a wider look at Peloton’s leaky API. TechCrunch verified the bug by uploading a profile photo with GPS coordinates of our New York office, and checking the metadata of the file while it was on the server.\nThe bugs were privately reported to both Peloton and Echelon.\nPeloton fixed its API issues earlier this month but said it needed more time to fix the metadata bug and to strip existing profile photos of any location data.

{"num":19,"Time":"4:57 PM GMT+1•December 13, 2018","Title":"Popular avatar app Boomoji exposed millions of users’ contact lists and location data","Content":"cameraImage Credits: TechCrunch\nPopular animated avatar creator app Boomoji, with more than five million users across the world, exposed the personal data of its entire user base after it failed to put passwords on two of its internet-facing databases.\nThe China-based app developer left the ElasticSearch databases online without passwords — a U.S.-based database for its international customers and a Hong Kong-based database containing mostly Chinese users’ data in an effort to comply with China’s data security laws, which requires Chinese citizens’ data to be located on servers inside the country.\nAnyone who knew where to look could access, edit or delete the database using their web browser. And, because the database was listed on Shodan, a search engine for exposed devices and databases, they were easily found with a few keywords.\nAfter TechCrunch reached out, Boomoji pulled the two databases offline. “These two accounts were made by us for testing purposes,” said an unnamed Boomoji spokesperson in an email.\nBut that isn’t true.\nThe database contained records on all of the company’s iOS and Android users — some 5.3 million users as of this week. Each record contained their username, gender, country and phone type.\nEach record also included a user’s unique Boomoji ID, which was linked to other tables in the database. Those other tables included if and which school they go to — a feature Boomoji touts as a way for users to get in touch with their fellow students. That unique ID also included the precise geolocation of more than 375,000 users that had allowed the app to know their location at any given time.\nWorse, the database contained every phone book entry of every user who had allowed the app access to their contacts.\nOne table had more than 125 million contacts, including their names (as written in a user’s phone book) and their phone numbers. Each record was linked to a Boomoji’s unique ID, making it relatively easy to know whose contact list belonged to whom.\nEven if you didn’t use the app, anyone who has your phone number stored on their device and used the app more than likely uploaded your number to Boomoji’s database. To our knowledge, there’s no way to opt out or have your information deleted.\nGiven Boomoji’s response, we verified the contents of the database by downloading the app on a dedicated iPhone using a throwaway phone number, containing a few dummy, but easy-to-search contact list entries. To find friends, the app matches your contacts with those registered with the app in its database. When we were prompted to allow the app access to our contacts list, the entire dummy contact list was uploaded instantly — and viewable in the database.\nSo long as the app was installed and had access to the contacts, new phone numbers would be automatically uploaded.\nYet, none of the data was encrypted. All of the data was stored in plaintext.\nAlthough Boomoji is based in China, it claims to follow California state law, where data protection and privacy rules are some of the strongest in the U.S. We asked Boomoji if it has or plans to inform California’s attorney general of the exposure as required by state law, but the company did not answer.\nGiven the vast amount of European users’ information in the database, the company may also face penalties under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, which can impose fines of up to four percent of the company’s global annual revenue for serious breaches.\nBut given its China-based presence, it’s not clear, however, what actionable repercussions the company could face.\nThis is the latest in a series of exposures involving ElasticSearch instances, a popular open source search and database software. In recent weeks, several high-profile data exposures have been reported as a result of companies’ failure to practice basic data security measures — including Urban Massage exposing its own customer database, Mindbody-owned FitMetrix forgetting to put a password on its servers and Voxox, a communications company, which leaked phone numbers and two-factor codes on millions of unsuspecting users.\nGot a tip?

{"num":21,"Time":"5:00 PM GMT+1•February 22, 2022","Title":"Behind the stalkerware network spilling the private phone data of hundreds of thousands","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Bryce Durbin \/ TechCrunch\nMuch of the spyware you hear of today are the powerful nation-state-backed exploits that can quietly and remotely hack into iPhones anywhere in the world. These powerful hacking tools are bought and operated by governments, often targeting their most vocal critics — journalists, activists and human rights defenders.\nThere is another kind of spyware that is more prevalent and much more likely to affect the average person: the consumer-grade spyware apps that are controlled by everyday people.\nConsumer-grade spyware is often sold under the guise of child monitoring software, but also goes by the term “stalkerware” for its ability to track and monitor other people or spouses without their consent. Stalkerware apps are installed surreptitiously by someone with physical access to a person’s phone and are hidden from home screens, but will silently and continually upload call records, text messages, photos, browsing history, precise location data and call recordings from the phone without the owner’s knowledge. Many of these spyware apps are built for Android, since it’s easier to plant a malicious app than on iPhones, which have tighter restrictions on what kind of apps can be installed and what data can be accessed.\nLast October, TechCrunch revealed a consumer-grade spyware security issue that’s putting the private phone data, messages and locations of hundreds of thousands of people, including Americans, at risk.\nBut in this case it’s not just one spyware app exposing people’s phone data. It’s an entire fleet of Android spyware apps that share the same security vulnerability.\nTechCrunch first discovered the vulnerability as part of a wider exploration of consumer-grade spyware. The vulnerability is simple, which is what makes it so damaging, allowing near-unfettered remote access to a device’s data. But efforts to privately disclose the security flaw to prevent it from being misused by nefarious actors has been met with silence both from those behind the operation and from Codero, the web company that hosts the spyware operation’s back-end server infrastructure.\nThe nature of spyware means those targeted likely have no idea that their phone is compromised. With no expectation that the vulnerability will be fixed any time soon, TechCrunch is now revealing more about the spyware apps and the operation so that owners of compromised devices can uninstall the spyware themselves, if it’s safe to do so.\nGiven the complexities in notifying victims, CERT\/CC, the vulnerability disclosure center at Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute, has also published a note about the spyware.\nWhat follows are the findings of a months-long investigation into a massive stalkerware operation that is harvesting the data from some 400,000 phones around the world, with the number of victims growing daily, including in the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, India, Jamaica, the Philippines, South Africa and Russia.\nOn the front line of the operation is a collection of white-label Android spyware apps that continuously collect the contents of a person’s phone, each with custom branding, and fronted by identical websites with U.S. corporate personas that offer cover by obfuscating links to its true operator. Behind the apps is a server infrastructure controlled by the operator, which is known to TechCrunch as a Vietnam-based company called 1Byte.\nThe user interface for planting the spyware. Image Credits: TechCrunch\nTechCrunch found nine nearly identical spyware apps that presented with distinctly different branding, some with more obscure names than others: Copy9, MxSpy, TheTruthSpy, iSpyoo, SecondClone, TheSpyApp, ExactSpy, FoneTracker and GuestSpy.\nOther than their names, the spyware apps have practically identical features under the hood, and even the same user interface for setting up the spyware. Once installed, each app allows the person who planted the spyware access to a web dashboard for viewing the victim’s phone data in real time — their messages, contacts, location, photos and more. Much like the apps, each dashboard is a clone of the same web software. And, when TechCrunch analyzed the apps’ network traffic, we found the apps all contact the same server infrastructure.\nBut because the nine apps share the same code, web dashboards and the same infrastructure, they also share the same vulnerability.\nThe vulnerability in question is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a class of bug that exposes files or data on a server because of sub-par, or no, security controls in place. It’s similar to needing a key to unlock your mailbox, but that key can also unlock every other mailbox in your neighborhood. IDORs are one of the most common kinds of vulnerability; TechCrunch has found and privately disclosed similar flaws before, such as when LabCorp exposed thousands of lab test results, and the recent case of CDC-approved health app Docket exposing COVID-19 digital vaccine records. IDORs have an advantage in that they can often be fixed at the server level without needing to roll out a software update to an app, or in this case a fleet of apps.\nBut shoddy coding didn’t just expose the private phone data of ordinary people. The entire spyware infrastructure is riddled with bugs that reveal more details about the operation itself. It’s how we came to learn that data on some 400,000 devices — though perhaps more — have been compromised by the operation. Shoddy coding also led to the exposure of personal information about its affiliates who bring in new paying customers, information that they presumably expected to be private; even the operators themselves.\nA web of companies that don’t seem to exist\nBehind each branded app, web dashboard and front-facing website is what appears to be a fictitious parent company with its own corporate website. The parent company websites are visually identical and all claim to be “software outsourcing” companies with over a decade of experience and hundreds of engineers, with each website claiming one of the nine branded apps as their flagship product.\nIf the identical websites weren’t an immediate red flag, the parent company websites are all hosted on the same web server. TechCrunch also searched state and public databases but found no current business records exist for any of the purported parent companies.\nOne of the many parent companies is Jexpa. Like the rest of the parent companies, Jexpa does not appear to exist on paper, but for a time an entity by that name did. Jexpa was registered as a technology company in California in 2003, but was suspended from the state’s business registry in 2009. The company’s domain was abandoned and left to expire.\nJexpa’s expired domain was purchased by an undisclosed buyer in 2015. (TechCrunch has found no evidence of any connection between the former Jexpa and the 2015 purchaser of Jexpa.com.) Jexpa.com now purports to be the site of a software outsourcing company, but is packed with stock photos and dummy pages and uses the likeness of several real-world identities, like “Leo DiCaprio,” but using the photo of Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles. The operators have gone to considerable lengths to conceal their true involvement in the operation, including registering email addresses using the identities of other people — in one case using the name and photo of a NYPD deputy commissioner and a former shipping executive in another.\nThe structure of the spyware apps and company personas set up by 1Byte. Image Credits: TechCrunch\nBut Jexpa runs deeper than just a name. TechCrunch found several overlaps between Jexpa and the branded spyware apps, including a set of release notes that was likely not meant to be public but had been left behind — and exposed — on its servers.\nThe release notes contain about three years of detailed changes and fixes to the back-end web dashboards, describing how the spyware has evolved since the log was first created in late-2018, with its most recent fixes deployed in April 2021. The notes were signed by a developer with a Jexpa.com email address.\nThe notes also describe fixes to what the developers call the Jexpa Framework, the software stack running on its servers that it uses to host the operation, each brand’s web dashboard and the storage for the massive amounts of phone data collected from the spyware apps themselves. We know this because, just as they had done with the release notes, the developers also left their technical documentation and the source code for the Jexpa Framework exposed to the internet.\nThe documentation laid out specific technical configurations and detailed instructions, with poorly redacted screenshots that revealed portions of several domains and subdomains used by the spyware apps. Those same screenshots also exposed the operator’s own website, but more on that in a moment. The documentation pages also use examples of the spyware apps themselves, like SecondClone, and meticulously describe how to set up new content storage servers for each app from scratch, even down to which web host to use — such as Codero, Hostwinds and Alibaba — because they allow for a particular disk storage setup required for the apps to work.\nFor a company with no apparent business filings, the operator put considerable effort into making Jexpa look like the top of the operation. But the operator left behind a trail of internet records, exposed source code and documentation that connects Jexpa, the Jexpa Framework and the fleet of spyware apps to a Vietnam-based company called 1Byte.\nA short time after we contacted 1Byte about the vulnerability and its links to Jexpa, the Jexpa Framework’s documentation pages were put behind a password wall, shutting us out.\nFrom London to Vietnam\n1Byte looks like any other software startup, a small team of Android and .NET developers living and working just outside of Ho Chi Minh City. Its Facebook page shows the group at team outings, dinners and enjoying the rewards of their work. But 1Byte is the same group of developers behind this enormous spyware operation that facilitates the surveillance of hundreds of thousands of people around the world.\nThe layers that they built to distance themselves from the operation suggests the group may be aware of the legal, or at least the reputational, risks associated with running an operation of this kind.\nIt’s not only 1Byte that’s apparently keen to keep its involvement a secret. The affiliates, who help to sell the software, also made efforts to conceal their identities.\n1Byte set up another company called Affiligate, which handles the payments for new customers buying the spyware and also gets the affiliates paid. Affiligate was set up under the guise of allowing app developers to sell their software, but in reality it is a small marketplace that sells mostly spyware. But shoddy coding seems to follow 1Byte wherever it goes. A bug in Affiligate’s marketplace is leaking the real identities of affiliates in the browser every time the page loads.\nAffiligate presents itself as a company based either in the U.K. or France, depending on where on its website you look. It even lists 1Byte as its Singapore office, though TechCrunch has found no evidence that 1Byte has any physical presence in Singapore. Public records show a U.K. company was incorporated under the name Affiligate in 2019 to Daniel Knights and later struck-off by the U.K. registrar in March 2021. Efforts by TechCrunch to locate and reach Daniel Knights were unsuccessful.\nOnly one other name shows up in Affiligate’s paperwork. The U.K. registrar records showed Affiligate’s only shareholder is Van Thieu, whose address on the paperwork puts him at a virtual office space in London. Thieu’s profile on LinkedIn lists him as a 1Byte shareholder in Vietnam, and in his profile photo he can be seen wearing a T-shirt with the 1Byte logo. Thieu is also the director of 1Byte, and is believed to be the head of the spyware operation. Though he is not listed on its website, Thieu is seen in several team photos on the group’s Facebook page. TechCrunch has identified two other 1Byte employees through the Affiligate bug, and another employee who left their name in the Jexpa Framework’s code.\nTechCrunch emailed 1Byte with details of the security vulnerability. The emails were opened, according to our email open tracker, but we did not get a reply. We followed up with 1Byte using the email address we had previously messaged, but the email bounced and was returned with an error message stating that the email address no longer exists. Emails sent directly to 1Byte employees were delivered but we did not receive any replies.\nSince contacting 1Byte and known affiliates, at least two of the branded spyware apps appeared to cease working or shut down.\nREAD MORE ON TECHCRUNCH\nA massive ‘stalkerware’ leak puts the phone data of thousands at risk\nYour Android phone could have stalkerware, here’s how to remove it\nA ‘stalkerware’ app leaked phone data from thousands of victims\nThat leaves us here. Without a fix, or intervention from the web host, TechCrunch cannot disclose more about the security vulnerability — even if it’s the result of bad actors themselves — because of the risk it poses to the hundreds of thousands of people whose phones have been unknowingly compromised by this spyware.\nWe have put together an explainer on how to remove the spyware from your phone, if you believe it is safe to do so. Because spyware is covert-by-design, keep in mind that removing the spyware will likely alert the person who planted it, which could create an unsafe situation. You can find support and resources on how to create a safety plan from the Coalition Against Stalkerware and the National Network to End Domestic Violence.\nDespite the growing threat posed by consumer-grade spyware in recent years, U.S. authorities have been hamstrung by legal and technical challenges in their efforts to tackle spyware operations.\nStalkerware still operates in a gray space in the United States, since the possession of spyware itself is not illegal. Federal prosecutors have in rare cases taken action against those who illegally plant spyware used for the sole purpose of surreptitiously intercepting a person’s communications in violation of federal wiretapping laws. But the government’s enforcement powers against operators are limited at best, and overseas spyware operators find themselves largely out of the jurisdictional reach of U.S. law enforcement.\nInstead, much of the front-line effort against stalkerware has been fought by antivirus makers and cybersecurity companies working together with human rights defenders at the technical level. The Coalition Against Stalkerware launched in 2019 and works to support victims and survivors of stalkerware. The coalition shares resources and samples of known stalkerware so information about new threats can be given to other cybersecurity companies and automatically blocked.\nIn 2020, Google banned stalkerware apps on the Google Play store, and later blocked stalkerware apps from advertising in its search results, albeit with mixed results.\nWhere laws have been largely ineffective at curbing spyware, federal authorities have sometimes used novel legal approaches to justify taking civil action against operators, like for failing to adequately protect the vast amounts of phone data that they collect, often by citing U.S. consumer protection and data breach laws. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission banned SpyFone from the surveillance industry in the first order of its kind after its “lack of basic security” led to the public exposure of data on more than 2,000 phones. In 2019, the FTC settled with Retina-X after it was hacked several times, and eventually shut down.\nStalkerware at large is no stranger to security problems; mSpy, Mobistealth, Flexispy, Family Orbit, KidsGuard and pcTattleTale have all made headlines in recent years for spilling, exposing or falling victim to hackers who access vast troves of phone data.\nNow an entire fleet of stalkerware apps can be added to the pile.\nIf you or someone you know needs help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) provides 24\/7 free, confidential support to victims of domestic abuse and violence. If you are in an emergency situation, call 911. The Coalition Against Stalkerware also has resources if you think your phone has been compromised by spyware.

The company said more sensitive information, such as location data, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers, and birth dates, had not been compromised.\nIn his statement, Khosrowshahi said the company had “obtained assurances that the downloaded data had been destroyed” and improved its security, but that the company’s “failure to notify affected individuals or regulators” had prompted him to take several steps, including the departure of two of the employees responsible for the company’s 2016 response.\nUber’s chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, was one of the two employees who left the company, Bloomberg reported.\nThe company’s failure to disclose the breach was “amateur hour”, said Chris Hoofnagle of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. “The only way one can have direct liability under security breach notification statutes is to not give notice. Thus, it makes little sense to cover up a breach.”\nUnder California state law, for example, companies are required to notify state residents of any breach of unencrypted personal information, and must inform the attorney general if more than 500 residents are affected by a single breach.\n“The hack and the cover-up is typical Uber only caring about themselves,” said Robert Judge, an Uber driver in Pittsburgh, who said he had yet to receive any communication from the company. “I found out through the media. Uber doesn’t get out in front of things, they hide them.”\nUber said in a statement to drivers that it would offer those affected free credit monitoring and identity theft protection.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the breach occured when two hackers obtained login credentials to access data stored on Uber’s Amazon Web Services account. Paul Lipman, CEO of cybersecurity firm BullGuard, said that the fact that the data was being stored unencrypted was “unforgivable”.\n“That’s just a complete misstep from an information security viewpoint,” he added.\nThe CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi. Photograph: Bloomberg\/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nThe New York state attorney general’s office has opened an investigation into the data breach, a spokeswoman confirmed.\nUber’s potential civil liability from the breach is complicated by the fact that the United States’ various federal appellate courts are divided over how to treat data breach lawsuits. Some courts allow individuals to join class action lawsuits if they are simply at greater risk of having their identities stolen due to a breach, while other courts require plaintiffs to show that their personal information has actually been misused.\nIn June, health insurer Anthem settled litigation over a 2015 breach affecting 79 million people for a record $115m.\n“Non-disclosure creates a practical risk in the hundreds of millions,” said Hoofnagle, who noted that companies can pay third parties to handle the fallout from a security breach – including notifications – for fees in the tens of millions. “Here’s the good news: drivers will finally squeeze money out of Uber.”\nThe hack and subsequent concealment is just the latest in a string of scandals and crises that Khosrowshahi inherited from his predecessor, Travis Kalanick, who was forced out of the $68bn startup in June.\nThe year started out with the trend-setting #DeleteUber viral boycott campaign, which arose after the company was accused of exploiting a New York taxi drivers’ work stoppage protesting against Trump’s travel ban.\nUber launches appeal against loss of London licence\nRead more\nThen in February, former employee Susan Fowler published a blogpost alleging a pervasive culture of gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the company.\nThe next month saw a New York Times report that for years Uber had been running a secret program to systematically deceive law enforcement officials in cities where its service violated regulations. Officials attempting to hail an Uber during a sting operation were “greyballed”; they might see icons of cars within the app navigating nearby, but no one would pick them up.\nFowler’s blogpost prompted Uber to commission an investigation of its workplace culture, and led to a public airing of the startup’s considerable dirty laundry. The company had soared to its position as the highest-value startup and dominant ride-hail app by defying rules and regulations, but the post-Fowler reckoning saw at least 20 employees fired and the company acknowledge that it needed to change. It also led to the eventual ousting of Kalanick himself.\nKhosrowshahi displayed the new conciliatory style in September when Transport for London decided not to renew its license to operate in London. “We’ve got things wrong along the way,” the CEO said at the time. “On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we’ve made.”\nFollow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Location data exposure because it discusses a massive global breach of personal information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and driver's license numbers, affecting 57 million Uber customers and drivers.

{"num":23,"Time":"11:08 AM GMT+2•July 9, 2018","Title":"Timehop discloses July 4 data breach affecting 21 million","Content":"Timehop has disclosed a security breach that has compromised the personal data (names and emails) of 21 million users (essentially its entire user base). Around a fifth of the affected users — or 4.7M — have also had a phone number that was attached to their account breached in the attack.\nThe startup, whose service plugs into users’ social media accounts to resurface posts and photos they may have forgotten about, says it discovered the attack while it was in progress, at 2:04 US Eastern Time on July 4, and was able to shut it down two hours, 19 minutes later — albeit, not before millions of people’s data had been breached.\nAccording to its preliminary investigation of the incident, the attacker first accessed Timehop’s cloud environment in December — using compromised admin credentials, and apparently conducting reconnaissance for a few days that month, and again for another day in March and one in June, before going on to launch the attack on July 4, during a US holiday.\nTimehop publicly disclosed the breach in a blog post on Saturday, several days after discovering the attack.\nIt says no social media content, financial data or Timehop data was affected by the breach — and its blog post emphasizes that none of the content its service routinely lifts from third party social networks in order to present back to users as digital “memories” was affected.\nHowever the keys that allow it to read and show users their social media content were compromised — so it has all keys deactivated, meaning Timehop users will have to re-authenticate to its App to continue using the service.\n“If you have noticed any content not loading, it is because Timehop deactivated these proactively,” it writes, adding: “We have no evidence that any accounts were accessed without authorization.”\nIt does also admit that the tokens could “theoretically” have been used for unauthorized users to access Timehop users’ own social media posts during “a short time window” — although again it emphasizes “we have no evidence that this actually happened”.\n“We want to be clear that these tokens do not give anyone (including Timehop) access to Facebook Messenger, or Direct Messages on Twitter or Instagram, or things that your friends post to your Facebook wall. In general, Timehop only has access to social media posts you post yourself to your profile,” it adds.\n“The damage was limited because of our long-standing commitment to only use the data we absolutely need to provide our service. Timehop has never stored your credit card or any financial data, location data, or IP addresses; we don’t store copies of your social media profiles, we separate user information from social media content — and we delete our copies of your “Memories” after you’ve seen them.”\nIn terms of how its network was accessed, it appears that the attacker was able to compromise Timehop’s cloud computing environment by targeting an account that had not been protected by multifactor authentication.\nThat’s very clearly a major security failure — but one Timehop does not explicitly explain, writing only that: “We have now taken steps that include multifactor authentication to secure our authorization and access controls on all accounts.”\nPart of its formal incident response, which it says began on July 5, was also to add multifactor authentication to “all accounts that did not already have them for all cloud-based services (not just in our Cloud Computing Provider)”. So evidently there was more than one vulnerable account for attackers to target.\nIts exec team will certainly have questions to answer about why multifactor authentication was not universally enforced for all its cloud accounts.\nFor now, by way of explanation, it writes: “There is no such thing as perfect when it comes to cyber security but we are committed to protecting user data. As soon as the incident was recognized we began a program of security upgrades.” Which does have a distinct ‘stable door being locked after the horse has bolted’ feel to it.\nIt also writes that it carried out “the introduction of more pervasive encryption throughout our environment” — so, again, questions should be asked why it took an incident response to trigger a “more pervasive” security overhaul.\nAlso not entirely clear from Timehop’s blog post: When\/if affected users were notified their information has been breached.\nThe company posed the blog post disclosing the security breach to its Twitter account on July 8. But prior to that its Twitter account was only noting that some “unscheduled maintenance” might be causing problems for users accessing the app…\nWe are currently doing some unscheduled maintenance on Timehop. You may have some issues accesing the app until further notice. Please follow this account for updates. Thank you for your patience!\n— Timehop (@timehop) July 8, 2018\nUPDATE: maintenance is still in progress. You can expect ongoing outages as we complete this work. Apologies for any inconvenience\n— Timehop (@timehop) July 8, 2018\nWe’ve reached out to the company with questions and will update this post with any response. Update: A Timehop spokesman says individual users are being notified as they log back in to the app.\n“An email to the entire user base is in the works for today,” he tells TechCrunch. “[It] took some time to get our send grid account ready for that many emails as we are not a big email sender in general.”\nIn terms of the reasons behind the multifactor fail, the spokesman said it’s still investigating why there was a security lapse “as we do in general make use of it”. “But this employee was here for so long, from back when we were just a baby company, so it seems something got overlooked,” he adds. \nIn its blog about the incident, Timehop says that at the same time as it was working to shut down the attack and tighten up security, company executives contacted local and federal law enforcement officials — presumably to report the breach.\nBreach reporting requirements are baked into Europe’s recently updated data protection framework, the GDPR, which puts the onus firmly on data controllers to disclose breaches to supervisory authorities — and to do so quickly — with the regulation setting a universal standard of within 72 hours of becoming aware of it (unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in “a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons”).\nReferencing GDPR, Timehop writes: “Although the GDPR regulations are vague on a breach of this type (a breach must be “likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals”), we are being pro-active and notifying all EU users and have done so as quickly as possible. We have retained and have been working closely with our European-based GDPR specialists to assist us in this effort.”\nThe company also writes that it has engaged the services of an (unnamed) cyber threat intelligence company to look for evidence of use of the email addresses, phone numbers, and names of users being posted or used online and on the Dark Web — saying that “while none have appeared to date, it is a high likelihood that they will soon appear”.\nTimehop users who are worried the network intrusion and data breach might have impact their “Streak” — aka the number Timehop displays to denote how many consecutive days they have opened the app — are being reassured by the company that “we will ensure all Streaks remain unaffected by this event”.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Location data exposure because Timehop, a social media service, disclosed a data breach that compromised the personal data (names and emails) of 21 million users.

Two security flaws allowed for discovery of location data against a user’s will, though they take a bit of doing.\nThe first of the flaws, which were discovered by Trever Faden and reported first by NBC News, allowed users to see a variety of data not available normally: who had blocked them, deleted photos, locations of people who had chosen not to share that data and more.\nThe catch is that if you wanted to find out about this, you had to hand over your username and password to Faden’s purpose-built website, C*ckblocked (asterisk original), which would then scour your Grindr account for this hidden metadata.\nOf course it’s a bad idea to surrender your credentials to any third party whatsoever, but regardless of that, this particular third party was able to find data that a user should not have access to in the first place.\nThe second flaw involved location data being sent unencrypted, meaning a traffic snooper might be able to detect it. (In its comment, Grindr says it encrypts and obfuscates location data, but has not specifically denied the existence of this issue.)\nIt may not sound too serious to have someone watching a Wi-Fi network know a person’s location — they’re there on the network, obviously, which narrows it down considerably. But users of a gay dating app are members of a minority often targeted by bigots and governments, and having their phone essentially send out a public signal saying “I’m here and I’m gay” without their knowledge is a serious problem.\nI’ve asked Grindr for comment and confirmation; the company told NBC News that it had changed how data was handled in order to prevent the C*ckblocked exploit (the site has since been shut down), but did not address the second issue.\nUpdate: Grindr has offered a statement on these issues, which I quote in part below (emphasis theirs):\nAnytime a user discloses their login credentials to an unknown third-party, they run the risk of exposing their own profile information, location information, and related metadata. We cannot emphasize this enough: we strongly recommend against our users sharing their personal login information with these websites as they risk exposing information that they have opted out of sharing.\nGrindr is a location-based app. Location is a critical element of our social network platform. This allows our users to feel connected to our community in a world that would seek to isolate us. That said, all information transmitted between a user’s device and our servers is encrypted and communicated in a way that does not reveal your specific location to unknown third parties.\nFurthermore, the statement points out, “In territories where homosexuality is criminalized, or it is otherwise unsafe to be LGBTQ identified, we deliberately obfuscate the location-based features of our application to protect our users.”\nI’ve asked for any further information on the possibility that location data was, as reported, sent unencrypted. I’ll update if I hear back.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Based on the provided news article, it appears to be related to Location data exposure.

Manhunt did not say what percentage of its users had their data stolen or how the data breach happened, but said that more than 7,700 Washington state residents were affected.\nStacey Brandenburg, an attorney for ZwillGen on behalf of Manhunt, said in an email that 11% of Manhunt users were affected.\nREAD MORE ON TECHCRUNCH\nRela, a Chinese lesbian dating app, exposed 5 million user profiles\nJewish dating app JCrush exposed user data and private messages\nSecurity flaw in Grindr exposed locations to third-party service\nA security flaw in Grindr let anyone easily hijack user accounts\nGrindr on the hook for €10M over GDPR consent violations\nBut questions remain about how Manhunt handled the breach.

Just months before the sale, Jack’d had a security lapse that exposed users’ private photos and location data.\nDating sites store some of the most sensitive information on their users, and are frequently a target of malicious hackers. In 2015, Ashley Madison, a dating site that encouraged users to have an affair, was hacked, exposing names, and postal and email addresses. Several people died by suicide after the stolen data was posted online. A year later, dating site AdultFriendFinder was hacked, exposing more than 400 million user accounts.\nIn 2018, same-sex dating app Grindr made headlines for sharing users’ HIV status with data analytics firms.\nIn other cases, poor security — in some cases none at all — led to data spills involving some of the most sensitive data. In 2019, Rela, a popular dating app for gay and queer women in China, left a server unsecured with no password, allowing anyone to access sensitive data — including sexual orientation and geolocation — on more than 5 million app users.

The app also shared users’ location data along with unique advertising and device identifiers, which could be used by other advertisers to track users across the internet and other apps.\nUltimately it was possible for third parties to associate fertility and pregnancy data “to a specific individual,” the FTC said in its complaint.\nThe FTC said that this third-party data sharing repeatedly violated Easy Healthcare’s privacy policies, which promised to share only “non-identifiable data” with third parties, in contravention of the FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule.\nEasy Healthcare also allegedly shared users’ sensitive identifiable data with two China-based mobile analytics companies known for “suspect privacy practices,” according to a statement by Connecticut attorney general William Tong. Data including IMEI numbers — strings of numbers tied to individual devices — and precise geolocation data were transferred to analytics firms Jiguang and Umeng between 2018 and 2020, according to the FTC.\nThe FTC alleges that the company did so knowing that Jiguang and Umeng could use this data for their own business purposes or could transfer the data to additional third parties, and says Easy Healthcare only stopped sharing this data when Google notified the app maker in 2020 that the transfer of data to Umeng violated its Google Play Store policies.\n“Premom broke its promises and compromised consumers’ privacy,” Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said. “We will vigorously enforce the Health Breach Notification Rule to defend consumer’s health data from exploitation. Companies collecting this information should be aware that the FTC will not tolerate health privacy abuses.”\nAs a part of a proposed settlement filed by the Department of Justice, Easy Healthcare has agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty for violating the FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule.

{"num":39,"Time":"7:00 PM GMT+2•June 30, 2022","Title":"How did a rental startup I’d never heard of leak my home address?","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Bryce Durbin \/ TechCrunch\nI consider myself a fairly privacy-conscious person, going out of my way to evade online tracking and, for the most part, avoiding spam mail. But when I found myself staring at my home address on the website of a company I had never heard of, I knew somewhere I had gone wrong.\nA few days before our rent was due at the end of April, my partner received an email from the owner of our apartment building about a new way we could pay rent while collecting reward points, like a loyalty program. It was a good offer at a time when rents are at record highs, so she clicked and it loaded the website of rental rewards company Bilt Rewards and prominently displayed her full name and our apartment number.\nAlready this was fairly alarming. Our apartment building had given her information to Bilt and we were now staring at it on its website. I never got the email that my partner received. But I was curious, did Bilt have my information too?\nAny time she clicked the link in the email, it opened the same personalized Bilt webpage showing her name and apartment number because the webpage was retrieving her information directly from Bilt’s servers through an API. (An API allows two things to talk to each other over the internet, in this case Bilt’s servers storing our information and its website.) You could see this using the browser’s developer tools, no fancy tricks needed. Using the browser’s tools, you could also see that the website was also pulling the name of the apartment building we live in, even though it wasn’t displayed on Bilt’s website.\nAt best this was a gross attempt at personalizing a sign-up page, and at worst it was a breach of our home address. But it was also possible to retrieve the same information directly from Bilt’s servers using just her email address — no special email link needed — which, like for many of us whose email addresses are public, unfortunately wouldn’t require much guesswork.\nI plugged in my email address and the site returned my name, building name and apartment number, all the same as my partner’s information. How was it possible for a startup I hadn’t heard of until this point to obtain and leak my home address?\nI am one of about 50 million renters in the United States. I live just outside New York City with my partner and our two cats in an apartment building owned by Equity Residential, one of the biggest corporate landlords in the U.S. with more than 80,000 rental apartments under its management. Even then, Equity is one of about 20 corporate landlords including Blackstone, AvalonBay and Starwood that account for over two million homes, or about 4% of all U.S. rental housing.\nEnter Bilt, one of many startups that have emerged thanks to the recent boom in the property technology space, or proptech, as it’s widely known. Bilt was founded by entrepreneur Ankur Jain in June 2021 and lets renters earn rewards each time they make a rent payment. It’s through partnerships with most of the largest corporate landlords that Bilt now offers its rental rewards program to more than two million rental homes across the U.S., including homes like mine that are owned by Equity.\nI started by thinking of this as any other data breach story I’ve covered in the past and wanted to know who else was affected.\nMy first call was to a neighbor in the same building, who when told about how Bilt’s website leaked my address, agreed to check to see if he was also affected. I pulled out my laptop and we entered his email address into Bilt’s API, which immediately returned his name, the building name and his apartment number; his face shifted from trepidation to horror, much as mine had done earlier in the day.\nMy second call was to Ken Munro, founder of U.K. cybersecurity testing firm Pen Test Partners, a name you might know from previous encounters with leaky online services, like Peloton bikes, smartphone apps and the occasional sex toy. Unbeknownst to me, one of his stateside colleagues has an apartment in my building and confirmed to me that the details of his home address were also exposed by the API.\nNow we’re at four people whose information was exposed by Bilt’s leaky website just by knowing their email address.\nI contacted Bilt, whose response was not great.\n“The API you sent below is working as intended,” responded Jain, now Bilt’s CEO. (Jain declared his email “off the record,” which requires both parties agree to the terms in advance. I told Jain we would publish his responses since there was no opportunity to decline.)\n“The only exception to this is a handful of buildings operated by Equity Residential, where they have not yet integrated Bilt into their native resident portal,” said Jain. “But given the small number of buildings, Equity made a risk decision to send email invitations and landing pages using a more manual approach in the short term. For this small set of pilot buildings, landing pages generated using this API require email only,” he said.\nJain said that the information returned by the API “is widely and easily available via any public records search,” and that there is “no private information being disclosed via this API that isn’t available across these public records.” (Jain and I will have to agree to disagree since up to this point I had kept my home address largely off the internet — and in any case, just because someone’s personal information is made public in one place isn’t a justification for making it public somewhere else.)\nWhen reached for comment, Equity spokesperson Marty McKenna said: “We are using this process at a limited number of buildings while we complete our integration with Bilt. We do not agree that this is a security issue,” said McKenna.\nMcKenna repeatedly declined to say how many Equity buildings had residents whose information was exposed. But my own leaked information left behind clues that suggest the number could be at least 21 Equity buildings, amounting to thousands of tenants. When asked about the number of buildings, McKenna did not dispute the figure.\nBilt eventually plugged its leaky API on May 26, almost a month after I first made contact.\nBut it still wasn’t clear how Bilt got my information to begin with, absent any mention of data collection or sharing in my signed lease agreement.\nMcKenna solved that mystery, telling me: “Equity Residential shares information with service providers to allow services to be provided to our residents. Our authority to do so lies in our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy which are available on our website.”\nThe short answer is yes, the privacy policy on the website that nobody thinks — nor I thought — to read. From the moment you walk into an Equity building, its privacy policy allows for a wide range of data collection, including offline collection, such as the data that is collected on you as you sign an agreement to rent an apartment. And most of that data can be shared with third-party companies for a broad number of reasons, like offering services on behalf of Equity. Companies like Bilt, according to the policy, “may have access [to personally identifiable information] in order to provide these services to us or on our behalf.”\nAnd it’s not unique to Equity. Many of the other corporate landlords use similar catch-all language in their privacy policies that gives them wide latitude to collect, use and share or sell your personal information.\nAvalonBay, which owns 79,000 apartments across the U.S. east coast, uses the same word-for-word language in its privacy policy about giving personal information about its tenants to third parties it works with. That can include laundry services, car parking providers or — like Bilt — rent payment processors. And the number of third parties with access to your personal information can quickly add up.\nErin McElroy, an assistant professor in the Department of American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, whose research includes proptech and housing, told TechCrunch that housing is becoming treated more as a commodity rather than a right or a social good. With tenants’ increasingly framed as consumers, much of what a person might experience when using a certain product or service is now also experienced as a tenant. “That’s strategic and part and parcel with the corporatization and financialization of housing, that certainly tenants don’t think of themselves as consumers and read all the fine print in their lease agreements, imagining that something like this might happen,” said McElroy.\nSome privacy policies go further. GID, which owns more than 86,000 residential units, has a privacy policy that explicitly allows it to sell extensive amounts of its tenants’ personal information to its affiliates, other management companies and data brokers that further collect, combine and sell your information to others.\n“It’s very common to have a privacy policy that governs the use of data,” Lisa Sotto, a privacy lawyer and partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth, told TechCrunch in a phone call. Sotto said that privacy policies are not empty words: “They are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, and the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices.”\nThe FTC can, and sometimes does, take action against companies that misuse data or have poor data security practices, like mortgage data firms exposing sensitive personal information, attempts to cover up data breaches and tech companies for breaking their privacy promises. As attorneys at law firm Orrick wrote: “The fact that you can sell your tenants’ data does not mean you should sell that data.”\nBut there are no rules that specifically protect the sharing of a tenant’s personal information.\nInstead, it’s up to each state to legislate. Only a handful of U.S. states — California, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah and Virginia — have passed privacy laws that protect consumers in those states, said Sotto. And only California’s law is currently in force at the time of writing.\nCalifornia became the first U.S. state to enact individual privacy rights — similar to those offered to all Europeans under GDPR. The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA as it’s known, came into force in January 2020 and grants Californians rights to access, change and delete the data that companies and organizations collect on them. The CCPA became a major thorn in the side of data-hungry companies because the law forced them to carve out wide exceptions in their privacy policies to allow Californians the right to opt-out of having their data sold to third parties. It also often necessitated companies to offer an entirely separate privacy policy for California residents, just like GDPR had done years earlier.\nCCPA is, like GDPR, imperfect to say the least. But as the first U.S. statewide privacy law in, it set the bar for other states to follow and, ideally, improve over time.\nVirginia is the next state with a law to come into effect in January 2023. But critics have called the bill “weak,” alongside reports that the bill’s text was authored by Amazon and Microsoft lobbyists, working to serve their corporate interests. Tech giants are backing and pushing for heavily lobbied state privacy laws, like Virginia’s, with the ultimate goal of prompting federal legislation that would create weaker blanket rules across the U.S. that would replace the patchwork of state laws — including California’s, where the rules are the strongest.\nBut while a fraction of Americans are covered by some privacy laws, the majority live in states that have little to no protections against the sharing of a person’s information.\n“There is really a paucity of legislation,” said McElroy. “Tenants are not told generally anything about what kinds of data are being collected about them. They don’t have the opportunity to consent and they’re not given any sort of indication of potential harms,” they said.\nWould I have moved into this apartment knowing that my corporate landlord would share my personal information with third parties that show little regard to protecting it? Maybe not. But with skyrocketing rents and a looming global economic downturn, despite record profits by some of America’s largest corporate landlords, renters may not have much of a choice.\n“As housing gets swept up by these corporations, there’s an affordable housing crisis in most cities and tenants can’t be too picky when it comes to finding a place to rent,” said McElroy. “Often tenants are forced to sort of forgo finding a landlord with less abusive data policies just because there aren’t options.”\nSo, how did a technology startup obtain my home address? Easily and legally. As for leaking it? That’s just bad security.\nMore on TechCrunch:\nPeriod tracker Stardust surges, but its privacy claims aren’t airtight\nGoogle is notifying Android users targeted by Hermit government-grade spyware\nDOJ says it will no longer prosecute good-faith hackers under CFAA\nComments are disabled for this article.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Location data exposure because it discusses a situation where a rental startup, Bilt Rewards, exposed the home addresses and other personal information of multiple individuals without their consent.

But soon you might be hearing from the authority after a recent security lapse exposed the personal information of vehicle owners.\nThe parking authority oversees about 14% of the paid parking spots in the Calgary region, and lets drivers pay to park their cars by a parking kiosk, online, or through the phone app by entering their vehicle’s license plate number and payment details.\nBut a logging server used to monitor the authority’s parking system for bugs and errors was left on the internet without a password. The server contained computer-readable technical logs, but also real-world events like payments and parking tickets that contained a driver’s personal information.\nA review of the logs by TechCrunch found contact information, like driver’s full names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses and postal addresses, as well as details of parking tickets and parking offenses — which included license plates and vehicle descriptions — and in some cases the location data of where the alleged parking offense took place. The logs also contained some partial card payment numbers and expiry dates.\nNone of the data was encrypted.\nBecause the server’s data was entangled with logs and other computer-readable data, it’s not known exactly how many people had their information exposed by the security lapse. (In 2019, the Calgary Parking Authority issued more than 450,000 parking tickets, up by 69% in five years.) However, TechCrunch has seen evidence that at least thousands of customers are affected, though the total number of affected customers is likely to be higher.\nSecurity researcher Anurag Sen found the exposed server and asked TechCrunch for help in reporting it to its owner. The server was secured on Tuesday, a day after TechCrunch contacted the authority.\nChristina Casallas, a spokesperson for the authority confirmed that the server was exposed since May 13, though data seen by TechCrunch shows records dating back to at least the start of the year. The authority also told TechCrunch that the exposure was due to human error and that it was investigating its logs to determine if anyone else had access to the server.\n“We at the CPA take this very seriously,” Moe Houssaini, the acting general manager for the Calgary Parking Authority, told TechCrunch in a statement. “Any public access has been disabled and we are actively investigating to determine what exact data was impacted and what unauthorized access may have occurred. We apologize to our customers and will be reaching out to all individuals who may have been impacted. Protecting the security of our systems and privacy of our customers is a top priority of the CPA. It was an isolated error, and the database has now been secured. We are reviewing our procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.”\nThe Calgary Parking Authority recently made headlines after it canceled more than a thousand parking tickets for drivers who were attending a COVID-19 vaccination center in the city.\nEarlier this year, New York-based cashless parking startup ParkMobile reported a data breach that saw personal account information and license plates on some 21 million customers taken by hackers. The company blamed the breach on a vulnerability in an unspecified piece of third-party software.\nRead more:\nGeico admits fraudsters stole customers’ driver’s license numbers for months\nMetromile says a website bug let a hacker obtain driver license numbers\nICE mined driver’s license photos for facial recognition\nVolkswagen says a vendor’s security lapse exposed 3.3 million drivers’ details\nYou can send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849.

That data spilled online","Content":"cameraImage Credits: StationaryTraveller\n(opens in a new window)\n\/ Getty Images\nHave you ever wondered why online ads appear for things that you were just thinking about?\nThere’s no big conspiracy. Ad tech can be creepily accurate.\nTech giant Oracle is one of a few companies in Silicon Valley that has near-perfected the art of tracking people across the internet. The company has spent a decade and billions of dollars buying startups to build its very own panopticon of users’ web browsing data.\nOne of those startups, BlueKai, which Oracle bought for a little over $400 million in 2014, is barely known outside marketing circles, but it amassed one of the largest banks of web tracking data outside of the federal government.\nBlueKai uses website cookies and other tracking tech to follow you around the web. By knowing which websites you visit and which emails you open, marketers can use this vast amount of tracking data to infer as much about you as possible — your income, education, political views, and interests to name a few — in order to target you with ads that should match your apparent tastes. If you click, the advertisers make money.\nBut for a time, that web tracking data was spilling out onto the open internet because a server was left unsecured and without a password, exposing billions of records for anyone to find.\nSecurity researcher Anurag Sen found the database and reported his finding to Oracle through an intermediary — Roi Carthy, chief executive at cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock and former TechCrunch reporter.\nTechCrunch reviewed the data shared by Sen and found names, home addresses, email addresses and other identifiable data in the database. The data also revealed sensitive users’ web browsing activity — from purchases to newsletter unsubscribes.\n“There’s really no telling how revealing some of this data can be,” said Bennett Cyphers, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch.\n“Oracle is aware of the report made by Roi Carthy of Hudson Rock related to certain BlueKai records potentially exposed on the Internet,” said Oracle spokesperson Deborah Hellinger. “While the initial information provided by the researcher did not contain enough information to identify an affected system, Oracle’s investigation has subsequently determined that two companies did not properly configure their services. Oracle has taken additional measures to avoid a reoccurrence of this issue.”\nOracle did not name the companies or say what those additional measures were, and declined to answer our questions or comment further.\nBut the sheer size of the exposed database makes this one of the largest security lapses this year.\nThe more it knows\nBlueKai relies on vacuuming up a never-ending supply of data from a variety of sources to understand trends to deliver the most precise ads to a person’s interests.\nMarketers can either tap into Oracle’s enormous bank of data, which it pulls in from credit agencies, analytics firms, and other sources of consumer data including billions of daily location data points, in order to target their ads. Or marketers can upload their own data obtained directly from consumers, such as the information you hand over when you register an account on a website or when you sign up for a company’s newsletter.\nBut BlueKai also uses more covert tactics like allowing websites to embed invisible pixel-sized images to collect information about you as soon as you open the page — hardware, operating system, browser and any information about the network connection.\nThis data — known as a web browser’s “user agent” — may not seem sensitive, but when fused together it can create a unique “fingerprint” of a person’s device, which can be used to track that person as they browse the internet.\nBlueKai can also tie your mobile web browsing habits to your desktop activity, allowing it to follow you across the internet no matter which device you use.\nSay a marketer wants to run a campaign trying to sell a new car model. In BlueKai’s case, it already has a category of “car enthusiasts” — and many other, more specific categories — that the marketer can use to target with ads. Anyone who’s visited a car maker’s website or a blog that includes a BlueKai tracking pixel might be categorized as a “car enthusiast.” Over time that person will be siloed into different categories under a profile that learns as much about you to target you with those ads.\n(Sources: DaVooda, Filborg\/Getty Images; Oracle BlueKai)\nThe technology is far from perfect. Harvard Business Review found earlier this year that the information collected by data brokers, such as Oracle, can vary wildly in quality.\nBut some of these platforms have proven alarmingly accurate.\nIn 2012, Target mailed maternity coupons to a high school student after an in-house analytics system figured out she was pregnant — before she had even told her parents — because of the data it collected from her web browsing.\nSome might argue that’s precisely what these systems are designed to do.\nJonathan Mayer, a science professor at Princeton University, told TechCrunch that BlueKai is one of the leading systems for linking data.\n“If you have the browser send an email address and a tracking cookie at the same time, that’s what you need to build that link,” he said.\nThe end goal: the more BlueKai collects, the more it can infer about you, making it easier to target you with ads that might entice you to that magic money-making click.\nBut marketers can’t just log in to BlueKai and download reams of personal information from its servers, one marketing professional told TechCrunch. The data is sanitized and masked so that marketers never see names, addresses or any other personal data.\nAs Mayer explained: BlueKai collects personal data; it doesn’t share it with marketers.\n‘No telling how revealing’\nBehind the scenes, BlueKai continuously ingests and matches as much raw personal data as it can against each person’s profile, constantly enriching that profile data to make sure it’s up to date and relevant.\nBut it was that raw data spilling out of the exposed database.\nTechCrunch found records containing details of private purchases. One record detailed how a German man, whose name we’re withholding, used a prepaid debit card to place a €10 bet on an esports betting site on April 19. The record also contained the man’s address, phone number and email address.\nAnother record revealed how one of the largest investment holding companies in Turkey used BlueKai to track users on its website. The record detailed how one person, who lives in Istanbul, ordered $899 worth of furniture online from a homeware store. We know because the record contained all of these details, including the buyer’s name, email address and the direct web address for the buyer’s order, no login needed.\nWe also reviewed a record detailing how one person unsubscribed from an email newsletter run by an electronics consumer, sent to his iCloud address. The record showed that the person may have been interested in a specific model of car dash-cam. We can even tell based on his user agent that his iPhone was out of date and needed a software update.\nThe more BlueKai collects, the more it can infer about you, making it easier to target you with ads that might entice you to that magic money-making click.\nThe data went back for months, according to Sen, who discovered the database. Some logs dated back to August 2019, he said.\n“Fine-grained records of people’s web-browsing habits can reveal hobbies, political affiliation, income bracket, health conditions, sexual preferences, and — as evident here — gambling habits,” said the EFF’s Cyphers. “As we live more of our lives online, this kind of data accounts for a larger and larger portion of how we spend our time.”\nOracle declined to say if it informed those whose data was exposed about the security lapse. The company also declined to say if it had warned U.S. or international regulators of the incident.\nUnder California state law, companies like Oracle are required to publicly disclose data security incidents, but Oracle has not to date declared the lapse. When reached, a spokesperson for California’s attorney general’s office declined to say if Oracle had informed the office of the incident.\nUnder Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, companies can face fines of up to 4% of their global annual turnover for flouting data protection and disclosure rules.\nTrackers, trackers everywhere\nBlueKai is everywhere — even when you can’t see it.\nOne estimate says BlueKai tracks over 1% of all web traffic — an unfathomable amount of daily data collection — and tracks some of the world’s biggest websites: Amazon, ESPN, Forbes, Glassdoor, Healthline, Levi’s, MSN.com, Rotten Tomatoes, and The New York Times. Even this very article has a BlueKai tracker because our parent company, Verizon Media, is a BlueKai partner.\nBut BlueKai is not alone. Nearly every website you visit contains some form of invisible tracking code that watches you as you traverse the internet.\nAs invasive as it is that invisible trackers are feeding your web browsing data to a gigantic database in the cloud, it’s that very same data that has kept the internet largely free for so long.\nTo stay free, websites use advertising to generate revenue. The more targeted the advertising, the better the revenue is supposed to be.\nWhile the majority of web users are not naive enough to think that internet tracking does not exist, few outside marketing circles understand how much data is collected and what is done with it.\nTake the Equifax data breach in 2017, which brought scathing criticism from lawmakers after it collected millions of consumers’ data without their explicit consent. Equifax, like BlueKai, relies on consumers skipping over the lengthy privacy policies that govern how websites track them.\nIn any case, consumers have little choice but to accept the terms. Be tracked or leave the site. That’s the trade-off with a free internet.\nBut there are dangers with collecting web-tracking data on millions of people.\n“Whenever databases like this exist, there’s always a risk the data will end up in the wrong hands and in a position to hurt someone,” said Cyphers.\nCyphers said the data, if in the hands of someone malicious, could contribute to identity theft, phishing or stalking.\n“It also makes a valuable target for law enforcement and government agencies who want to piggyback on the data gathering that Oracle already does,” he said.\nEven when the data stays where it’s intended, Cyphers said these vast databases enable “manipulative advertising for things like political issues or exploitative services, and it allows marketers to tailor their messages to specific vulnerable populations,” he said.\n“Everyone has different things they want to keep private, and different people they want to keep them private from,” said Cyphers. “When companies collect raw web browsing or purchase data, thousands of little details about real people’s lives get scooped up along the way.”\n“Each one of those little details has the potential to put somebody at risk,” he said.\nSend tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849.\nComments are disabled for this article.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is about Location data exposure.

The amount of information people are comfortable with posting online varies.\nBut most people accept that whatever we put on our public profile page is out in the public domain.\nSo, how would you feel if all your information was catalogued by a hacker and put into a monster spreadsheet with millions of entries, to be sold online to the highest paying cyber-criminal?\nThat's what a hacker calling himself Tom Liner did last month \"for fun\" when he compiled a database of 700 million LinkedIn users from all over the world, which he is selling for around $5,000 (£3,600; €4,200).\nThe incident, and other similar cases of social media scraping, have sparked a fierce debate about whether or not the basic personal information we share publicly on our profiles should be better protected.\nIn the case of Mr Liner, his latest exploit was announced at 08:57 BST in a post on a notorious hacking forum.\nIt was a strangely civilised hour for hackers, but of course we have no idea which time zone, the hacker who calls himself Tom Liner, lives in.\n\"Hi, I have 700 million 2021 LinkedIn records\", he wrote.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nCareers networking site Linkedin was the target for Tom Liner's data scraping\nIncluded in the post was a link to a sample of a million records and an invite for other hackers to contact him privately and make him offers for his database.\nUnderstandably the sale caused a stir in the hacking world and Tom tells me he is selling his haul to \"multiple\" happy customers for around $5,000 (£3,600; €4,200).\nHe won't say who his customers are, or why they would want this information, but he says the data is likely being used for further malicious hacking campaigns.\nThe news has also set the cyber-security and privacy world alight with arguments about whether or not we should be worried about this growing trend of mega scrapes.\nWhat's important to understand here is that these databases aren't being created by breaking into the servers or websites of social networks.\nThey are largely constructed by scraping the public-facing surface of platforms using automatic programmes to take whatever information is freely available about users.\nIn theory, most of the data being compiled could be found by simply picking through individual social media profile pages one-by-one. Although of course it would take multiple lifetimes to gather as much data together, as the hackers are able to do.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nNURPHOTO\nImage caption,\n1.3 million user records were scraped from audio-only social media app, Clubhouse\nSo far this year, there have been at least three other major \"scraping\" incidents.\nIn April, a hacker sold another database of around 500 million records scraped from LinkedIn.\nIn the same week another hacker posted a database of scraped information from 1.3 million Clubhouse profiles on a forum for free.\nAlso in April, 533 million Facebook user details were compiled from a mixture of old and new scraping before being given away on a hacking forum with a request for donations.\nThe hacker who says he is responsible for that Facebook database, calls himself Tom Liner.\nI spoke with Tom over three weeks on Telegram messages, a cloud-based instant messenger app. Some messages and even missed calls were made in the middle of the night, and others during working hours so there was no clue as to his location.\nThe only clues to his normal life were when he said he couldn't talk on the phone as his wife was sleeping and that he had a daytime job and hacking was his \"hobby\".\nTom told me he created the 700 million LinkedIn database using \"almost the exact same technique\" that he used to create the Facebook list.\nHe said: \"It took me several months to do. It was very complex. I had to hack the API of LinkedIn. If you do too many requests for user data in one time then the system will permanently ban you.\"\nImage caption,\nTom Liner posted about his data scrape on a hacker forum\nAPI stands for application programming interface and most social networks sell API partnerships, which enable other companies to access their data, perhaps for marketing purposes or for building apps.\nTom says he found a way to trick the LinkedIn API software into giving him the huge tranche of records without setting off alarms.\nPrivacy Shark, which first discovered the sale of the database, examined the free sample and found it included full names, email addresses, gender, phone numbers and industry information.\nLinkedIn insists that Tom Liner did not use their API but confirmed that the dataset \"includes information scraped from LinkedIn, as well as information obtained from other sources\".\nIt adds: \"This was not a LinkedIn data breach and no private LinkedIn member data was exposed. Scraping data from LinkedIn is a violation of our Terms of Service and we are constantly working to ensure our members' privacy is protected.\"\nIn response to its April data scare Facebook also brushed off the incident as an old scrape. The press office team even accidentally revealed to a reporter that their strategy is to \"frame data scraping as a broad industry issue and normalise the fact that this activity happens regularly\".\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nFacebook was hit by a data scrapping incident, with 533 million user records collected\nHowever, the fact that hackers are making money from these databases is worrying some experts on cyber security.\nThe chief executive and founder of SOS Intelligence, a company which provides firms with threat intelligence, Amir Hadžipašić, sweeps hacker forums on the dark web day and night. As soon as news of the 700 million LinkedIn database spread he and his team began analysing the data.\nMr Hadžipašić says the details in this, and other mass-scraping events, are not what most people would expect to be available in the public domain. He thinks API programmes, which give more information about users than the general public can see, should be more tightly controlled.\n\"Large-scale leaks like this are concerning, given the intricate detail, in some cases, of this information - such as geographic locations or private mobile and email addresses.\n\"To most people it will come as a surprise that there's so much information held by these API enrichment services.\n\"This information in the wrong hands could be significantly impacting for some,\" he said.\nMore Technology of Business\nHow your driving may reveal early signs of Alzheimer's\nTired of working from home? Put the office on wheels\nHow to get a lucrative job in cybersecurity\nHow airlines will stop losing your bags in the future\nWhy small investors are piling into share-trading\nTom Liner says he knows his database is likely to be used for malicious attacks.\nHe says it does \"bother him\" but would not say why he still continues to carry out scraping operations.\nMr Hadžipašić, who is based in southern England, says hackers who are buying the LinkedIn data could use it to launch targeted hacking campaigns on high-level targets, like company bosses for example.\nHe also said there is value in the sheer number of active emails in the database that can be used to send out mass email phishing campaigns.\n'No ambiguity'\nBut cyber-security expert Troy Hunt, who spends most of his working life poring over the contents of hacked databases for his website haveibeenpwned.com, is less concerned about the recent scraping incidents and says we need to accept them as part of our public profile-sharing.\n\"These are definitely not breaches, there's no ambiguity here. Most of this data is public anyway.\n\"The question to ask, in each case though, is how much of this information is by user choice publicly accessible and how much is not expected to be publicly accessible.\"\nTroy agrees with Amir that controls on social network's API programmes need to be improved and says we can't brush off these incidents.\n\"I don't disagree with the stance of Facebook and others but I feel that the response of 'this isn't a problem' is, whilst possibly technically accurate, missing the sentiment of how valuable this user data is and their perhaps downplaying their own roles in the creation of these databases.\"\nMr Liner's actions would be likely to get him sued by social networks for intellectual property theft or copyright infringement. He probably wouldn't face the full force of the law for his actions if he were ever found but, when asked if he was worried about getting arrested he said \"no, anyone can't find me\" and ended our conversation by saying \"have a nice time\".\nRelated Topics\nData breaches\nSocial media\nComputer hacking\nFacebook\nLinkedIn","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about personal data being scraped from social media, which is relevant to Location data exposure.

{"num":42,"Time":"Mon 4 Apr 2022 16.05 CEST","Title":"How can US law enforcement agencies access your data? Let’s count the ways","Content":"A brazen hack that exposed consumer data collected by Apple and the Facebook-parent company Meta has raised fresh questions about how secure our data is in the hands of tech companies and how easily law enforcement can get hold of the information big tech collects.\nIt was revealed last week that hackers obtained the information of some Apple and Meta users by forging an emergency legal request, one of several mechanisms by which law enforcement agencies can request or demand that tech companies hand over data such as location and subscriber information.\nFacebook demands LAPD end social media surveillance and use of fake accounts\nRead more\nLawmakers and privacy advocates argued the forgery was a warning sign that the system is in need of reform. “No one wants tech companies to refuse legitimate emergency requests,” but the current system has “clear weaknesses”, Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement following the hack.\nA review of the myriad ways tech companies share consumer data with law enforcement agencies reveals that it’s often fairly straightforward for such bodies to get their hands on consumer data. “[Your data is] pretty much all available to the government in one form or another,” said Jennifer Lynch, the surveillance litigation director at the digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n“One of the real challenges with technology these days is that it is next to impossible to figure out exactly all the data that companies are collecting on us and to exert any kind of control over what happens to that data,” added Lynch.\nAn emergency legal request, like the one the hackers forged, for instance, doesn’t require a subpoena or warrant, unlike many other legal requests. It’s supposed to be reserved for exceptional situations: Apple considers legal requests an “emergency” if “it relates to circumstance(s) involving imminent and serious threat(s) to: 1) the life\/safety of individual(s); 2) the security of a State; 3) the security of critical infrastructure\/installation”. But, as the hackers have shown, it can be easily exploited.\nApple and Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\nHere are some of the main ways law enforcement can get hold of your data.\nAccessing your device\nPerhaps the most obvious way law enforcement can get your data is by accessing your physical device. Police can subpoena your device or get a search warrant to go through your phones. If your phone is locked or you only use encrypted messaging apps, police can use mobile device forensic tools to break the encryption or bypass your lock screens if they are armed with a warrant.\nIn February 2021, a US appeals court ruled that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) can freely search your devices without a warrant at the borders. The move created “a massive loophole to target anyone traveling into or out of the US”, said Albert Fox Cahn, the founder of the privacy advocacy firm Surveillance Technology Oversight Project.\nLaw enforcement requests\nIf you scan privacy policies of your most used apps you’ll probably find a clause or two that says something along the lines of “we don’t share your user data ever unless it’s in response to a law enforcement request”. That means police, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the FBI and other law enforcement agencies can get your user data directly from tech companies through various forms of legal requests, without having to search your device. Sometimes, they can get it just by asking for it.\nGoogle, for example, received more than 39,000 requests for user information between July and December 2020, according to the company’s most recent transparency report. Google handed over user info in response to more than 80% of those requests, affecting the accounts of more than 89,000 users.\nIn many cases these requests come with gag orders, meaning the company cannot notify users that their information has been requested for six months or more. Sometimes it will be years before a user finds out their information has been handed over to law enforcement.\nThere are a handful of different types of law enforcement requests, some more sweeping than others and some carrying more legal weight. Three types of legal requests in particular have recently sparked concern among activists and experts: geofence warrants, keyword search warrants and administrative subpoenas.\nA keyword search warrant allows law enforcement to access the information of anyone who searched for certain terms or keywords within a certain time period.\nA geofence warrant allows law enforcement agencies to seek the device information of all the users who were at a certain place at a certain time. Google, the only company that currently discloses the number of geofence warrants it receives, said it fielded a little under 3,000 in the last quarter of 2020.\nBoth types of warrants, privacy experts say, are over-broad and thus violate the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches. While many warrants typically seek the information of a single person or group of people who are suspected of a crime, geofence and keyword search warrants work backwards and cast a wide net hoping to narrow down a list of suspects.\nIt’s not unlike cell-tower dumps, for which law enforcement agencies ask cellphone companies for the information of all people who were connected to a cell tower in the vicinity of a crime scene at the time the crime was suspected to have occurred.\nA federal judge in Virginia recently ruled that local authorities violated the constitution when using a geofence warrant to investigate a 2019 robbery, setting a precedent that attorneys representing people caught up in these types of searches could use to receive remedies for being falsely suspected or accused of a crime.\nAdministrative subpoenas carry less legal weight than other requests: law enforcement agencies don’t need a judge to sign off on them but they also aren’t self-enforcing. The only way the agencies can force a company to hand over the data demanded in the request is by taking them to court after they refuse to comply. Still, companies will often comply with the request even though it is not a court-ordered subpoena. Some experts have expressed concern of the use of this type of request by Ice, which has requested user data from tech companies like Google, fearing the agency is using them to expand its surveillance on US citizens. An Ice official previously said the agency does not often send administrative subpoenas to tech companies for non-criminal purposes. In a press release, Ice said it “uses statutorily-authorized immigration subpoenas to obtain information as part of investigations regarding potential removable aliens”.\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nData brokers\nThere is an entire industry of companies and firms that buy and sell your data for a profit. The shadowy network of data brokers operates fairly under the radar but often provides easy access to user data such as your location and purchase history to other entities, including law enforcement.\nData brokers can collect your personal data from a handful of different sources, such as your social media profiles, public records and other commercial sources or companies. Some data brokers integrate directly into apps to hoover up information like location and purchase history. These brokers, which can include some telecommunications companies and credit reporting agencies, then sell that raw data, or inferences and analysis based on that data,to other companies and government agencies.\nIt’s not always clear whether a data broker has collected or sold your information. In fact, recently data broker X Mode, whose customers include military contractors, was exposed for buying location data from the Muslim prayer app Muslim Pro without the knowledge of users of the app.\nSurveillance tech companies\nLaw enforcement agencies also contract with surveillance tech companies like Clearview AI and Voyager, which scrape your information from the internet and social media and feed it into their own algorithms.\nConsumer tech companies you may interact with on a daily basis also provide services to police. Amazon’s smart doorbell Ring, for instance, gives some police special access to their Neighbors social network and makes it easy for the police to monitor and request Ring footage from consumers.\nContracts between tech companies and law enforcement agencies have become more frequent as the tech industry seeks out new avenues of growth, experts say. Because many of the spaces tech is already in have clear dominant players, law enforcement contracts have become an appealing growth strategy because of the seemingly endless supply of funding for agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and local police.\nData-sharing\nThere’s also quite a bit of inter-agency data sharing happening at the local, state and federal levels of government. While it might seem unsurprising that law enforcement agencies share information, you might be surprised to learn that an entity like the DMV shares information with agencies like Ice.\nThat data-sharing is made easier by services from companies like Palantir, which creates a centralized network of digital records which include “chronic offenders” and other people deemed of interest that can be easily accessed by the company’s law enforcement partners at all levels – from many local police departments to the FBI.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to location data exposure because it discusses various ways law enforcement agencies can access user data, including location and subscriber information.

It is important that data anyone has accessed is deleted immediately,” said Todd.\nNorthern Ireland’s Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said it was “appalled” by the “potentially calamitous” breach.\n“This is a breach of monumental proportions. Even if it was done accidentally, it still represents a data and security breach that should never have happened,” Liam Kelly, chair of the federation, said in a statement.\n“Inadequate or poor oversight of FOI procedures must be addressed and addressed urgently. New safeguards are obviously required to prevent this from ever happening again,” he said.\nKelly said many serving officers “do everything possible to protect their police roles,” due to heightened security concerns in Northern Ireland.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today program on Wednesday, Kelly said that PSNI officers operate “under the veil of the highest potential threat.”\n“What you’ve got here is a spectrum of officers. People like myself and the senior management in police, it’s public knowledge that we are police officers, it’s public knowledge where we work, but there are a lot of officers in our service who don’t have that freedom available to them, for all manner of reasons,” he said.\nHe said legal action is “something we will consider once the investigation concludes.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Location data exposure.

At the time of writing, the database had over 49 million records — but was growing by the hour.\nFrom a brief review of the data, each record contained public data scraped from influencer Instagram accounts, including their bio, profile picture, the number of followers they have, if they’re verified and their location by city and country, but also contained their personal contact information, such as the Instagram account owner’s email address and phone number.\nSecurity researcher Anurag Sen discovered the database and alerted TechCrunch in an effort to find the owner and get the database secured. We traced the database back to Mumbai-based social media marketing firm Chtrbox, which pays influencers to post sponsored content on their accounts. The records contained data that calculated the worth of each account, based off the number of followers, engagement, reach, likes and shares they had. This was used as a metric to determine how much the company could pay an Instagram celebrity or influencer to post an ad.\nTechCrunch found several high-profile influencers in the exposed database, including prominent food bloggers, celebrities and other social media influencers.\nWe contacted several people at random whose information was found in the database and provided them their phone numbers. Two of the people responded and confirmed their email address and phone number found in the database was used to set up their Instagram accounts. Neither had any involvement with Chtrbox, they said.\nShortly after we reached out, Chtrbox pulled the database offline. Pranay Swarup, the company’s founder and chief executive, did not respond to a request for comment and several questions, including how the company obtained personal Instagram account email addresses and phone numbers. Later in a tweet, Chtrbox disputed the number of people affected and claimed no more than 350,000 influencers were affected. Chtrbox also said database was only open for 72 hours, but the researcher confirmed the database was first detected on Shodan, a search engine for exposed databases and devices, on May 14.\nThe scraping effort comes two years after Instagram admitted a security bug in its developer API allowed hackers to obtain the email addresses and phone numbers of six million Instagram accounts. The hackers later sold the data for bitcoin.\nMonths later, Instagram — now with more than a billion users — choked its API to limit the number of requests apps and developers can make on the platform.\nFacebook, which owns Instagram, later said it disputed the report.\n“We take any allegation of data misuse seriously. Following an initial investigation into the claims made in this story, we found that no private emails or phone numbers of Instagram users were accessed,” said an Instagram spokesperson. “Chtrbox’s database had publicly available information from many sources, one of which was Instagram. Chtrbox also clarified that the database contained information for 350,000 people, not 49 million as has been reported,”\n“We’re looking into the issue to understand if the data described – including email and phone numbers – was from Instagram or from other sources,” said an updated statement. “We’re also inquiring with Chtrbox to understand where this data came from and how it became publicly available,” it added.\nUpdated on 5\/23 with additional comments from Facebook and a statement from Chtrbox. We have also updated the wording of the article to note that email addresses and phone numbers in the database are personal information but may have been set to public by the users.\nGot a tip?

The notice said LetMeSpy is blocking users from logging in or signing up with new accounts.\nA separate notice on LetMeSpy’s former login page, which no longer functions, confirmed earlier reports that the hacker who breached the spyware operation also deleted the data on its servers.\n“The breach consisted of unauthorized access to the LetMeSpy website’s database, downloading and at the same time deleting data from the website by the author of the attack,” the notice reads.\nLetMeSpy’s app no longer functions, a network traffic analysis by TechCrunch shows, and the spyware maker’s website no longer provides the spyware app for download.\nLetMeSpy was an Android phone monitoring app that was purposefully designed to stay hidden on a victim’s phone home screen, making the app difficult to detect and remove.

{"num":61,"Time":"8:00 PM GMT+2•April 3, 2021","Title":"How Jamaica failed to handle its JamCOVID scandal","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Valery Sharifulin\n(opens in a new window)\n\/ Getty Images\nAs governments scrambled to lock down their populations after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared last March, some countries had plans underway to reopen. By June, Jamaica became one of the first countries to open its borders.\nTourism represents about one-fifth of Jamaica’s economy. In 2019 alone, four million travelers visited Jamaica, bringing thousands of jobs to its three million residents. But as COVID-19 stretched into the summer, Jamaica’s economy was in free fall, and tourism was its only way back — even if that meant at the expense of public health.\nThe Jamaican government contracted with Amber Group, a technology company headquartered in Kingston, to build a border entry system allowing residents and travelers back onto the island. The system was named JamCOVID and was rolled out as an app and a website to allow visitors to get screened before they arrive. To cross the border, travelers had to upload a negative COVID-19 test result to JamCOVID before boarding their flight from high-risk countries, including the United States.\nAmber Group’s CEO Dushyant Savadia boasted that his company developed JamCOVID in “three days” and that it effectively donated the system to the Jamaican government, which in turn pays Amber Group for additional features and customizations. The rollout appeared to be a success, and Amber Group later secured contracts to roll out its border entry system to at least four other Caribbean islands.\nBut last month TechCrunch revealed that JamCOVID exposed immigration documents, passport numbers and COVID-19 lab test results on close to half a million travelers — including many Americans — who visited the island over the past year. Amber Group had set the access to the JamCOVID cloud server to public, allowing anyone to access its data from their web browser.\nWhether the data exposure was caused by human error or negligence, it was an embarrassing mistake for a technology company — and, by extension, the Jamaican government — to make.\nAnd that might have been the end of it. Instead, the government’s response became the story.\nA trio of security lapses\nBy the end of the first wave of coronavirus, contact-tracing apps were still in their infancy, and few governments had plans in place to screen travelers as they arrived at their borders. It was a scramble for governments to build or acquire technology to understand the spread of the virus.\nJamaica was one of a handful of countries using location data to monitor travelers, prompting rights groups to raise concerns about privacy and data protection.\nAs part of an investigation into a broad range of these COVID-19 apps and services, TechCrunch found that JamCOVID was storing data on an exposed, passwordless server.\nThis wasn’t the first time TechCrunch found security flaws or exposed data through our reporting. It also was not the first pandemic-related security scare. Israeli spyware maker NSO Group left real location data on an unprotected server that it used for demonstrating its new contact-tracing system. Norway was one of the first countries with a contact-tracing app, but pulled it after the country’s privacy authority found the continuous tracking of citizens’ location was a privacy risk.\nJust as we have with any other story, we contacted who we thought was the server’s owner. We alerted Jamaica’s Ministry of Health to the data exposure on the weekend of February 13. But after we provided specific details of the exposure to ministry spokesperson Stephen Davidson, we did not hear back. Two days later, the data was still exposed.\nAfter we spoke to two American travelers whose data was spilling from the server, we narrowed down the owner of the server to Amber Group. We contacted its chief executive Savadia on February 16, who acknowledged the email but did not comment, and the server was secured about an hour later.\nWe ran our story that afternoon. After we published, the Jamaican government issued a statement claiming the lapse was “discovered on February 16” and was “immediately rectified,” neither of which were true.\nCONTACT US\nGot a tip? Contact us securely using SecureDrop. Find out more here.\nInstead, the government responded by launching a criminal investigation into whether there was any “unauthorized” access to the unprotected data that led to our first story, which we perceived to be a thinly veiled threat directed at this publication. The government said it had contacted its overseas law enforcement partners.\nWhen reached, a spokesperson for the FBI declined to say whether the Jamaican government had contacted the agency.\nThings didn’t get much better for JamCOVID. In the days that followed the first story, the government engaged a cloud consultant, Escala 24×7, to assess JamCOVID’s security. The results were not disclosed, but the company said it was confident there was “no current vulnerability” in JamCOVID. Amber Group also said that the lapse was a “completely isolated occurrence.”\nA week went by and TechCrunch alerted Amber Group to two more security lapses. After the attention from the first report, a security researcher who saw the news of the first lapse found exposed private keys and passwords for JamCOVID’s servers and databases hidden on its website, and a third lapse that spilled quarantine orders for more than half a million travelers.\nAmber Group and the government claimed it faced “cyberattacks, hacking and mischievous players.” In reality, the app was just not that secure.\nPolitically inconvenient\nThe security lapses come at a politically inconvenient time for the Jamaican government, as it attempts to launch a national identification system, or NIDS, for the second time. NIDS will store biographic data on Jamaican nationals, including their biometrics, such as their fingerprints.\nThe repeat effort comes two years after the government’s first law was struck down by Jamaica’s High Court as unconstitutional.\nCritics have cited the JamCOVID security lapses as a reason to drop the proposed national database. A coalition of privacy and rights groups cited the recent issues with JamCOVID for why a national database is “potentially dangerous for Jamaicans’ privacy and security.” A spokesperson for Jamaica’s opposition party told local media that there “wasn’t much confidence in NIDS in the first place.”\nTech’s role in the COVID-19 response: Assist, don’t reinvent\nIt’s been more than a month since we published the first story and there are many unanswered questions, including how Amber Group secured the contract to build and run JamCOVID, how the cloud server became exposed and if security testing was conducted before its launch.\nTechCrunch emailed both the Jamaican prime minister’s office and Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica’s Ministry of National Security, to ask how much, if anything, the government donated or paid to Amber Group to run JamCOVID and what security requirements, if any, were agreed upon for JamCOVID. We did not get a response.\nAmber Group also has not said how much it has earned from its government contracts. Amber Group’s Savadia declined to disclose the value of the contracts to one local newspaper. Savadia did not respond to our emails with questions about its contracts.\nJamaica’s Amber Group fixes second JamCOVID security lapse\nFollowing the second security lapse, Jamaica’s opposition party demanded that the prime minister release the contracts that govern the agreement between the government and Amber Group. Prime Minister Andrew Holness said at a press conference that the public “should know” about government contracts but warned “legal hurdles” may prevent disclosure, such as for national security reasons or when “sensitive trade and commercial information” might be disclosed.\nThat came days after local newspaper The Jamaica Gleaner had a request to obtain contracts revealing the salaries of state officials denied by the government under a legal clause that prevents the disclosure of an individual’s private affairs. Critics argue that taxpayers have a right to know how much government officials are paid from public funds.\nJamaica’s opposition party also asked what was done to notify victims.\nGovernment minister Samuda initially downplayed the security lapse, claiming just 700 people were affected. We scoured social media for proof but found nothing. To date, we’ve found no evidence that the Jamaican government ever informed travelers of the security incident — either the hundreds of thousands of affected travelers whose information was exposed, or the 700 people that the government claimed it notified but has not publicly released.\nTechCrunch emailed the minister to request a copy of the notice that the government allegedly sent to victims, but we did not receive a response. We also asked Amber Group and Jamaica’s prime minister’s office for comment. We did not hear back.\nMany of the victims of the security lapse are from the United States. Neither of the two Americans we spoke to in our first report were notified of the breach.\nSpokespeople for the attorneys general of New York and Florida, whose residents’ information was exposed, told TechCrunch that they had not heard from either the Jamaican government or the contractor, despite state laws requiring data breaches to be disclosed.\nJamaica’s JamCOVID pulled offline after third security lapse exposed travelers’ data\nThe reopening of Jamaica’s borders came at a cost. The island saw more than a hundred new cases of COVID-19 in the month that followed, the majority arriving from the United States. From June to August, the number of new coronavirus cases went from tens to dozens to hundreds each day.\nTo date, Jamaica has reported over 39,500 cases and 600 deaths caused by the pandemic.\nPrime Minister Holness reflected on the decision to reopen its borders last month while in parliament to announce the country’s annual budget. He said the country’s economic decline last was “driven by a massive 70% contraction in our tourist industry.” More than 525,000 travelers — both residents and tourists — have arrived in Jamaica since the borders opened, Holness said, a figure slightly more than the number of travelers’ records found on the exposed JamCOVID server in February.\nHolness defended reopening the country’s borders.\n“Had we not done this the fallout in tourism revenues would have been 100% instead of 75%, there would be no recovery in employment, our balance of payment deficit would have worsened, overall government revenues would have been threatened, and there would be no argument to be made about spending more,” he said.\nBoth the Jamaican government and Amber Group benefited from opening the country’s borders. The government wanted to revive its falling economy, and Amber Group enriched its business with fresh government contracts. But neither paid enough attention to cybersecurity, and victims of their negligence deserve to know why.\nSend tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849.

It is understood that the breach does not involve private addresses.\nThe data was published in response to a freedom of information request at about 2.30pm, the PSNI said.\nIts assistant chief constable, Chris Todd, has apologised to officers and said the severe terrorist threat facing officers has made news of the extensive data breach the “last thing that anybody in the organisation wants to be hearing”.\nTodd added: “Regrettably, this evening, I’ve had to inform the Information Commissioner’s Office of a significant data breach that we’re responsible for. What’s happened is we’ve received a freedom of information request, that’s quite a routine inquiry, nothing untoward in that.\n“We’ve responded to that request, which was seeking to understand the total numbers of officers and staff at all ranks and grade across the organisation, and in the response, unfortunately, one of our colleagues has embedded the source data, which informed that request.\n“So, what was within that data was the surname, initial, the rank or grade, the location and the departments for each of our current employees across the police service.”\nWhen asked if the chief constable, Simon Byrne, would be coming back from his summer break, Todd added: “I can’t speak on behalf of the chief constable, but he is certainly aware of this situation as it’s developed today.”\nThe data was available to the public for between two and a half to three hours, Todd said.\n“We believe it was uploaded about 2.30 this afternoon,” he said. “It came to my attention as the senior information risk owner at about 4pm, with the cooperation of the host provider it was taken down within the hour.”\nThe chair of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland has called for an urgent inquiry. Liam Kelly said: “This is a breach of monumental proportions.\n“Even if it was done accidentally, it still represents a data and security breach that should never have happened. Rigorous safeguards ought to have been in place to protect this valuable information which, if in the wrong hands, could do incalculable damage.\n“Inadequate or poor oversight of FOI procedures must be addressed and addressed urgently. New safeguards are obviously required to prevent this from ever happening again.”\nDuring the Troubles, police officers in Northern Ireland were regularly attacked by republican paramilitary groups. Members of the PSNI have also been targeted in gun and bomb attacks in the years after the Good Friday agreement.\nIn February, senior PSNI officer DCI John Caldwell suffered life-changing injuries when he was shot after coaching a youth football team in Omagh in County Tyrone.\nAsked how useful the information released in the data breach would be to terrorist organisations, Todd said it would be of a “significant concern” to PSNI officers and staff.\n“It is limited to surname and initial only, so there’s no other personal identifiable information contained within the information that was published,” he said. “That will be, still, a significant concern to many of my colleagues, I know that, and we will ensure that we do everything we can to mitigate any security risks that are identified.”\nHe added: “I’ve written to all my colleagues across the whole of the service this evening and explained to them the actions that we’re taking, giving them information to help them further protect their own personal security and those around them.\n“We will listen to the concerns of all of our colleagues individually and address any concerns that are raised.”\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, said he was “deeply concerned” about the data breach. The Alliance leader Naomi Long MLA said the scale of the PSNI data breach was of “profound concern”, adding: “Immediate action must be taken to offer … proper information, support, guidance and necessary reassurances regarding their and their families’ security.\n“Whilst the personal data has now been removed, once such information has been published online, it leaves an indelible footprint.”\nMike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist representative on the Policing Board of Northern Ireland, has called for an emergency meeting of the Policing Board on Wednesday.\nThe Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has been notified about the incident. An ICO spokesperson said: “The Police Service of Northern Ireland has made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information provided.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Location data exposure because it involves a data breach that exposed sensitive information about police officers in Northern Ireland.

That included names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, email addresses and phone numbers, and other sensitive financial information, such as credit scores, limits and balances.\nSome one million Canadians were also affected by the CapitalOne breach.\nThompson also accessed the cloud stored data of more than 30 other companies, according to a superseding indictment filed by the Justice Department almost two years after Thompson was first charged, which reportedly included Vodafone, Ford, Michigan State University and the Ohio Department of Transportation.\nThompson was convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which prohibits a person from accessing a computer system without authorization. There was some question about her motives, which some said classed Thompson as a potential ethical hacker — the Justice Department said in May that it would no longer prosecute good-faith security researchers — but prosecutors said Thompson “exploited mistakes to steal valuable data and sought to enrich herself,” including using the servers she hijacked to plant and mine cryptocurrency.\nThe Seattle jury found Thompson not guilty of identity theft and charges relating to device access fraud.\nThe breach of CapitalOne’s cloud data, much of it stored on Amazon’s cloud, was one of the biggest hacks of the decade by size alone but also because of the sensitivity of the financial information.

Password-protected web services, such as banking or secure HTTP addresses, would not have been included, and neither would data from password-protected wireless networks.\nGoogle blamed the mistake on a piece of legacy code from an experimental project that had been re-used to programme equipment on the Street View cars, and said it will ask a third party to oversee deletion of the data and its procedures.\n\"As soon as we became aware of this problem, we grounded our Street View cars and segregated the data on our network, which we then disconnected to make it inaccessible. We want to delete this data as soon as possible, and are currently reaching out to regulators in the relevant countries about how to quickly dispose of it.\"\nGoogle said the discovery highlighted the vulnerability of data in open wifi networks. It has previously said other companies, including Skyhook and Microsoft, already scan wifi networks and gather information in this way.\nGoogle Street View has been introduced in more than 20 countries, and has also been extended outside the initial 21 major UK cities.\nBut it has faced regular concerns about privacy, which started in Britain on the day of the launch after users found images of a man throwing up in the street and another leaving a sex shop. In April last year, residents in Broughton barricaded roads to stop the Street View car entering the village, saying it would encourage crime and was an invasion of privacy.\nGoogle is struggling with stricter privacy laws in Germany, where it has yet to launch the service, and Switzerland where it was introduced in August. Despite a flood of demands from the European Union, including wiping its Street View images after six months instead of 12, Google has said it remains committed to Street View in Europe. It said reports that it would stop mapping streets in any more EU countries are inaccurate.\nThis article was amended on 21 May 2010. The original said: That the Google Street View feature currently displays images from cities in nine countries, including 21 in the UK. This has been corrected.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is about Location data exposure.

The company said hackers were able to access personal information for nearly half of those accounts.\nThat information included name, relationship status, religion, birthdate, workplaces, search activity, and recent location check-ins. The company had initially said 50m accounts were affected.\nAccording to Facebook VP of Product Management Guy Rosen, attackers were able to access name and contact information for half of the hacked accounts. For 14m, the attackers were also able to scrape virtually all the other data available on members’ profile pages. One million victims got away without any information being stolen.\nRosen says the attackers did not access any credit card information associated with members’ accounts, and that the company has not received any reports of stolen information being available on the dark web – portions of the internet requiring special software to reach.\nFacebook removes hundreds of US political pages for 'inauthentic activity'\nRead more\nThe social network also found no evidence that attackers used the stolen tokens to access any third-party apps, including those that use Facebook’s single-sign-in to log in. It also did not impact users on other Facebook properties such as Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus.\nFacebook plans to notify members over the next few days as to what information may have been taken, and alert them to be on the lookout for suspicious emails, text messages, or calls.\nAsked whether Facebook would pay for some kind of identity theft monitoring service for affected users – as breached companies often do – a spokeswoman said: “Not at this time.”\nThe hackers began by using a series of seed accounts and attacking the accounts of friends, then friends of friends, and so on down the line, eventually amassing a group of 400,000 compromised accounts. Using some of these accounts, they managed to steal access tokens for an additional 30m before they were stopped.\nRosen says Facebook first noticed a spike in unusual activity on 14 September. By the 25th, it had identified that activity as an attack. Two days later, Facebook had plugged the hole and reset users’ tokens, preventing attackers from accessing any further information.\nBy then, the damage had already been done.\nUpon request from the FBI, Facebook declined to offer any information as to who might be behind the attack, or whether users in specific regions were targeted.\nIf any of the victims reside in Europe, it could trigger significant penalties under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, notes Pravin Kothari, CEO of security firm CipherCloud.\n“Not knowing all of the details about when the breach was discovered and who was impacted, the possible outcomes may be worse than we know today,” he says. “We’ll have to see what Facebook discloses about potential liability, if any exists. The calculations of the potential fines under GDPR are a bit mind-boggling.”\nBecause the vulnerability has existed since July 2017, Facebook has not ruled out the possibility that smaller attacks on its token system went undetected before September. It is currently investigating.\nFacebook has created a security notice page where users can check whether their account was impacted by the data breach.\nJulia Carrie Wong contributed reporting","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Location data exposure because it discusses a data breach on Facebook in which personal information of 14 million accounts was stolen.

A logging database used by the company for keeping track of bugs and errors with the apps was left on the internet without a password, according to security researcher Anurag Sen, who found the exposed database and asked TechCrunch for help in reporting the lapse to the company.\nThe database and the hundreds of gigabytes of data inside — hosted on a Huawei-hosted cloud server in China — could be accessed from the web browser just by knowing its IP address. Shodan, a search engine for exposed devices and databases, shows the server was continually storing the most recent month’s worth of logs since at least early January when the database was first exposed.\nA short time after we reported that the app was not end-to-end encrypted as the company claims, the database was shut down.\nJuphoon, the China-based cloud company behind the messaging app, says on its website that it spun out JusTalk in 2016 and is now owned and operated by Ningbo Jus, a company that appears to share the same office as listed on Juphoon’s website.\nLeo Lv, Juphoon’s chief executive and JusTalk’s founder, opened our emails but did not respond, or say if the company planned on notifying users about the security lapse.\nBecause the server’s data was entangled with logs and other computer-readable data, it’s not known exactly how many people had their private messages exposed by the security lapse.\nThe server was collecting and storing more than 10 million individual logs each day, including millions of messages sent over the app, including the phone numbers of the sender, the recipient and the message itself. The database also logged all placed calls, which included the caller’s and recipient’s phone numbers in each record.\nBecause each message recorded in the database contained every phone number in the same chat, it was possible to follow entire conversations, including from children who were using the JusTalk Kids app to chat with their parents. One conversation chain contained enough personal information to identify a pastor who was using the app to solicit a sex worker who lists their phone number publicly for their services, including the time, location and the price of their meeting.\nNone of the messages were encrypted, despite JusTalk’s claims.\nWe also previously reported that the database also included granular location data of thousands of users collected from users’ phones, with large clusters of users in the U.S., U.K., India, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and mainland China. The database also contained records from a third app, JusTalk 2nd Phone Number, which allows users to generate virtual, ephemeral phone numbers to use instead of giving out their private cell phone number. A review of some of these records show the database was logging both the person’s cell phone number and every ephemeral phone number that they generated.\nBut TechCrunch found evidence that Sen was not alone in finding the exposed database.\nAn undated ransom note left on the database suggests it was accessed on at least one occasion by a data extortionist, a bad actor that scans the internet for exposed databases in order to steal it and threaten to publish the data unless a ransom of a few hundred dollars worth of cryptocurrency is paid.\nIt’s not known if any JusTalk data was lost or stolen as a result of the extortionist’s access, but the blockchain address associated with the ransom note shows it has not yet received any funds.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Location data exposure because the messaging app JusTalk exposed a significant amount of user data, including millions of messages, phone numbers of senders and recipients, call records, and granular location data.

{"num":68,"Time":"Thu 3 Dec 2020 22.34 CET","Title":"ACLU files request over data US collected via Muslim app used by millions","Content":"The American Civil Liberties Union is seeking the release of three years of records that could shed light on how the US government acquired cellphone location data collected through apps used by millions of Muslims around the world.\nThe Freedom of Information Act (Foia) request, filed on Thursday by the ACLU and CUNY Law School’s Clear clinic, follows an investigation published last month in Motherboard that revealed tech companies, including the one connected to the Muslim Pro app, sold personal location data of its users to the US military and defense contractors. The Muslim Pro app has been downloaded by close to 100 million people and is used to aid Muslims in planning prayer, finding local halal food and fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. Data collected from a Muslim dating app, a Craigslist app, and an app used for tracking storms was also sold to US agencies.\n“The harvesting of data on Muslim app users worldwide is a serious threat to privacy and religious freedom,” the ACLU said on Twitter on Thursday morning, adding that the records it is seeking would help answer questions that could help prevent this kind of data harvesting in the future. “This is yet another betrayal of trust for communities who have long been subjected to intrusive, often unconstitutional surveillance by governments in the United States,” the organization added.\nIn the official request, filed against 10 federal agencies including each branch of the US military, the Department of Justice, the DEA, CIA and FBI, the organizations allege that the data sales discriminate against Muslims and violate the fourth amendments, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The document also cites a 2018 supreme court ruling that specifically bars law enforcement agencies from obtaining this kind of data without a search warrant.\n“These developments raise serious concerns about the scope of the Agencies’ purchases, the Agencies’ discriminatory focus on Muslims, and the warrantless acquisition and use of location information from people inside the United States,” they write in the request. The records request is just the first step and could lead to separate litigation, the ACLU said.\nMotherboard’s exposé was the first detailed report on how the US military purchases the location data, according to the Foia, and it revealed two separate streams used by federal agencies to access the data: a company called Babel Street and its product, “Locate X”, and a location data firm called X-Mode, which pays apps to siphon location data that it can then sell.\nLocate X is a powerful tool that can track the movement of cellphones. It enables investigators to home in on a specific area, identify mobile devices in the area, and watch where those devices go. The data can go back months, and though the tracking is anonymized, a Babel Street employee told Motherboard the information could easily be de-anonymized.\nUnited States Special Operations Command bought access to Locate X, according to the Motherboard report, for roughly $90,600. “Our access to the software is used to support Special Operations Forces mission requirements overseas,” Navy Cmdr Tim Hawkins, a US Special Operations Command spokesman said in a statement included with the story, adding, “we strictly adhere to established procedures and policies for protecting the privacy, civil liberties, constitutional and legal rights of American citizens.” Other agencies, including US Customs and Border Protection and the Secret Service have also purchased access, according to a separate report about the tech tool published by Protocol in March.\nX-Mode uses a different approach. It works by paying apps to include code that skims location data that can then be sold. The company’s CEO told reporters that X-Mode tracks roughly 25 million devices in the US each month and an additional 40 million around the world. It’s embedded in roughly 400 apps, often without the end-user’s knowledge.\nThe data collected is sold to a variety of different clients, including, Motherboard reported, a private intelligence firm “whose goal is to use location data to track people down to their ‘doorstep’” and US military contractors.\nMuslim Pro, the widely used prayer app, stopped sharing data with X-Mode after the story broke, but the report showcased the shadowy networks that collect and distribute data and how it can end up being used by agencies without a direct connection to the apps themselves.\nMajlis Ash-Shura, the Islamic Leadership Council of New York that represents 90 mosques in the state, urged its members to delete the Muslim Pro app, according to the Los Angeles Times, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations sent letters to US House committee chairs demanding an investigation into the data sales and called for legislation that would prohibit US government agencies from purchasing the personal data.\nSenator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, has also promised an investigation into how the US Department of Homeland Security has utilized the warrantless collection of phone location data. “Despite what shady data brokers believe, the 4th amendment isn’t for sale,” he tweeted on 25 November, along with a Wall Street Journal article reporting that a majority of Americans are worried about the government tracking them. “The American people are paying attention, and they’re sick and tired of government overreach into their personal information.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about Location data exposure.

REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach\/File Photo\nA growing number of countries in the region have opted to use Bluetooth short-range radio to measure the risk of exposure, after concluding that tracking people’s movements using location data would be intrusive.\nEuropean Union member states hope soon to agree a common approach for an international ‘roaming’ feature that could help revive travel and tourism.\nWHAT’S THE STORY SO FAR?\nSince there is no cure for COVID-19, governments have turned to technology to create a sort of digital ‘herd immunity’ against the flu-like disease.\nAfter initial efforts misfired, Apple and Alphabet’s Google - whose iOS and Android operating systems run 99% of the world’s smartphones - developed a standard that logs contacts securely on devices.\nGermany joins a growing list of European countries - led by Switzerland, Italy, Poland and Latvia - to create Bluetooth apps based on this decentralized approach.\nHOW DOES THE GERMAN APP WORK?\nGermany’s Covid-Warn-App, developed by SAP and Deutsche Telekom, will be available for download on Monday night from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\nOnce the app is installed it will typically show a ‘green’, or safe, status.\nShould the user spend more than 15 minutes within two metres of another app holder who later tests positive for COVID-19, they would receive a notification advising them to seek medical advice.\nWHAT ARE THE SECURITY FEATURES?\nThe Bluetooth exchanges logged securely on devices are encrypted and pseudonyms are used, so the identity of the other person is not known.\nIn another security feature, positive test results would be uploaded by the German app using a QR code from the lab.\nOther phones scan the system and, if one finds a so-called infected key in its log, the holder receives an exposure notification. No data is stored centrally, making it impossible to reconstruct an individual’s relationships.\nSOUNDS COMPLICATED - WILL IT WORK?\nThe design of Bluetooth-based apps represents a trade-off between usefulness and privacy. It is not possible, for example, to pinpoint the exact time and place of risk events from the app alone.\nProtecting privacy, though, is a key selling point for the German app, which is voluntary and will need to be adopted by a large share of the population to be useful.\nNorway on Monday halted its COVID-19 app after the country’s data protection watchdog objected to the app’s collection of location data as disproportionate to the task, and called for a Bluetooth-only approach.\nGermany’s app is intended to complement, not replace, existing contact tracing efforts that rely on interviewing people who fall ill with COVID-19 and calling people they have met.\nWhere the app can come in useful is in public settings - such as a train trip or bus ride - where people don’t know each other. Its speed is also a plus as COVID-19 can be spread by people who have yet to develop symptoms.\nWHAT ABOUT FOREIGN TRAVEL?\nAlthough the apps are national, the idea is that they should be able to ‘talk’ to each other. Such interoperability would make it possible to monitor infection risks when people travel between countries.\nEU member states have already agreed on broad guidelines for interoperability, and are close to backing the creation of a central gateway to handle data traffic between the apps based on the Google-Apple standard, sources say.\nReporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Location data exposure because it discusses the launch of a smartphone app in Germany aimed at breaking the chain of coronavirus infection by tracking encounters between people.

{"num":81,"Time":"Thu 6 Jun 2013 12.05 CEST","Title":"NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily","Content":"The National Security Agency is currently collecting the telephone records of millions of US customers of Verizon, one of America's largest telecoms providers, under a top secret court order issued in April.\nThe order, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian, requires Verizon on an \"ongoing, daily basis\" to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the US and between the US and other countries.\nThe document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.\nThe secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Fisa) granted the order to the FBI on April 25, giving the government unlimited authority to obtain the data for a specified three-month period ending on July 19.\nUnder the terms of the blanket order, the numbers of both parties on a call are handed over, as is location data, call duration, unique identifiers, and the time and duration of all calls. The contents of the conversation itself are not covered.\nThe disclosure is likely to reignite longstanding debates in the US over the proper extent of the government's domestic spying powers.\nUnder the Bush administration, officials in security agencies had disclosed to reporters the large-scale collection of call records data by the NSA, but this is the first time significant and top-secret documents have revealed the continuation of the practice on a massive scale under President Obama.\nThe unlimited nature of the records being handed over to the NSA is extremely unusual. Fisa court orders typically direct the production of records pertaining to a specific named target who is suspected of being an agent of a terrorist group or foreign state, or a finite set of individually named targets.\nThe Guardian approached the National Security Agency, the White House and the Department of Justice for comment in advance of publication on Wednesday. All declined. The agencies were also offered the opportunity to raise specific security concerns regarding the publication of the court order.\nThe court order expressly bars Verizon from disclosing to the public either the existence of the FBI's request for its customers' records, or the court order itself.\n\"We decline comment,\" said Ed McFadden, a Washington-based Verizon spokesman.\nThe order, signed by Judge Roger Vinson, compels Verizon to produce to the NSA electronic copies of \"all call detail records or 'telephony metadata' created by Verizon for communications between the United States and abroad\" or \"wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls\".\nThe order directs Verizon to \"continue production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of this order\". It specifies that the records to be produced include \"session identifying information\", such as \"originating and terminating number\", the duration of each call, telephone calling card numbers, trunk identifiers, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, and \"comprehensive communication routing information\".\nThe information is classed as \"metadata\", or transactional information, rather than communications, and so does not require individual warrants to access. The document also specifies that such \"metadata\" is not limited to the aforementioned items. A 2005 court ruling judged that cell site location data – the nearest cell tower a phone was connected to – was also transactional data, and so could potentially fall under the scope of the order.\nWhile the order itself does not include either the contents of messages or the personal information of the subscriber of any particular cell number, its collection would allow the NSA to build easily a comprehensive picture of who any individual contacted, how and when, and possibly from where, retrospectively.\nIt is not known whether Verizon is the only cell-phone provider to be targeted with such an order, although previous reporting has suggested the NSA has collected cell records from all major mobile networks. It is also unclear from the leaked document whether the three-month order was a one-off, or the latest in a series of similar orders.\nThe court order appears to explain the numerous cryptic public warnings by two US senators, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, about the scope of the Obama administration's surveillance activities.\nFor roughly two years, the two Democrats have been stridently advising the public that the US government is relying on \"secret legal interpretations\" to claim surveillance powers so broad that the American public would be \"stunned\" to learn of the kind of domestic spying being conducted.\nBecause those activities are classified, the senators, both members of the Senate intelligence committee, have been prevented from specifying which domestic surveillance programs they find so alarming. But the information they have been able to disclose in their public warnings perfectly tracks both the specific law cited by the April 25 court order as well as the vast scope of record-gathering it authorized.\nJulian Sanchez, a surveillance expert with the Cato Institute, explained: \"We've certainly seen the government increasingly strain the bounds of 'relevance' to collect large numbers of records at once — everyone at one or two degrees of separation from a target — but vacuuming all metadata up indiscriminately would be an extraordinary repudiation of any pretence of constraint or particularized suspicion.\" The April order requested by the FBI and NSA does precisely that.\nThe law on which the order explicitly relies is the so-called \"business records\" provision of the Patriot Act, 50 USC section 1861. That is the provision which Wyden and Udall have repeatedly cited when warning the public of what they believe is the Obama administration's extreme interpretation of the law to engage in excessive domestic surveillance.\nIn a letter to attorney general Eric Holder last year, they argued that \"there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows.\"\n\"We believe,\" they wrote, \"that most Americans would be stunned to learn the details of how these secret court opinions have interpreted\" the \"business records\" provision of the Patriot Act.\nPrivacy advocates have long warned that allowing the government to collect and store unlimited \"metadata\" is a highly invasive form of surveillance of citizens' communications activities. Those records enable the government to know the identity of every person with whom an individual communicates electronically, how long they spoke, and their location at the time of the communication.\nSuch metadata is what the US government has long attempted to obtain in order to discover an individual's network of associations and communication patterns. The request for the bulk collection of all Verizon domestic telephone records indicates that the agency is continuing some version of the data-mining program begun by the Bush administration in the immediate aftermath of the 9\/11 attack.\nThe NSA, as part of a program secretly authorized by President Bush on 4 October 2001, implemented a bulk collection program of domestic telephone, internet and email records. A furore erupted in 2006 when USA Today reported that the NSA had \"been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans, using data provided by AT&T, Verizon and BellSouth\" and was \"using the data to analyze calling patterns in an effort to detect terrorist activity.\" Until now, there has been no indication that the Obama administration implemented a similar program.\nThese recent events reflect how profoundly the NSA's mission has transformed from an agency exclusively devoted to foreign intelligence gathering, into one that focuses increasingly on domestic communications. A 30-year employee of the NSA, William Binney, resigned from the agency shortly after 9\/11 in protest at the agency's focus on domestic activities.\nIn the mid-1970s, Congress, for the first time, investigated the surveillance activities of the US government. Back then, the mandate of the NSA was that it would never direct its surveillance apparatus domestically.\nAt the conclusion of that investigation, Frank Church, the Democratic senator from Idaho who chaired the investigative committee, warned: \"The NSA's capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left, such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter.\"\nAdditional reporting by Ewen MacAskill and Spencer Ackerman","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Location data exposure because it reveals that the National Security Agency (NSA) is collecting a vast amount of telecommunications data, including location data, of millions of Verizon customers daily.

{"num":83,"Time":"10:00 PM GMT+2•August 26, 2023","Title":"A Brazilian phone spyware was hacked and victims’ devices ‘deleted’ from server","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Jake O'Limb \/ PhotoMosh \/ Getty Images\nA Portuguese-language spyware called WebDetetive has been used to compromise more than 76,000 Android phones in recent years across South America, largely in Brazil. WebDetetive is also the latest phone spyware company in recent months to have been hacked.\nIn an undated note seen by TechCrunch, the unnamed hackers described how they found and exploited several security vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise WebDetetive’s servers and access its user databases. By exploiting other flaws in the spyware maker’s web dashboard — used by abusers to access the stolen phone data of their victims — the hackers said they enumerated and downloaded every dashboard record, including every customer’s email address.\nThe hackers said that dashboard access also allowed them to delete victim devices from the spyware network altogether, effectively severing the connection at the server level to prevent the device from uploading new data. “Which we definitely did. Because we could. Because #fuckstalkerware,” the hackers wrote in the note.\nThe note was included in a cache containing more than 1.5 gigabytes of data scraped from the spyware’s web dashboard. That data included information about each customer, such as the IP address they logged in from and their purchase history. The data also listed every device that each customer had compromised, which version of the spyware the phone was running, and the types of data that the spyware was collecting from the victim’s phone.\nThe cache did not include the stolen contents from victims’ phones.\nDDoSecrets, a nonprofit transparency collective that indexes leaked and exposed datasets in the public interest, received the WebDetetive data and shared it with TechCrunch for analysis.\nIn total, the data showed that WebDetetive had compromised 76,794 devices to date at the time of the breach. The data also contained 74,336 unique customer email addresses, though WebDetetive does not verify a customer’s email addresses when signing up, preventing any meaningful analysis of the spyware’s customers.\nIt’s not known who is behind the WebDetetive breach and the hackers did not provide contact information. TechCrunch could not independently confirm the hackers’ claim that it deleted victims’ devices from the network, though TechCrunch did verify the authenticity of the stolen data by matching a selection of device identifiers in the cache against a publicly accessible endpoint on WebDetetive’s server.\nWebDetetive is a type of phone monitoring app that is planted on a person’s phone without their consent, often by someone with knowledge of the phone’s passcode.\nOnce planted, the app changes its icon on the phone’s home screen, making the spyware difficult to detect and remove. WebDetetive then immediately begins stealthily uploading the contents of a person’s phone to its servers, including their messages, call logs, phone call recordings, photos, ambient recordings from the phone’s microphone, social media apps, and real-time precise location data.\nDespite the broad access that these “stalkerware” (or spouseware) apps have to a victim’s personal and sensitive phone data, spyware is notoriously buggy and known for their shoddy coding, which puts victims’ already-stolen data at risk of further compromise.\nWebDetetive, meet OwnSpy\nLittle is known about WebDetetive beyond its surveillance capabilities. It’s not uncommon for spyware makers to conceal or obfuscate their real-world identities, given the reputational and legal risks that come with producing spyware and facilitating the illegal surveillance of others. WebDetetive is no different.\nBut while the breached data itself reveals few clues about WebDetetive’s administrators, much of its roots can be traced back to OwnSpy, another widely used phone spying app.\nTechCrunch downloaded the WebDetetive Android app from its website (since both Apple and Google ban stalkerware apps from their app stores), and planted the app onto a virtual device, allowing us to analyze the app in an isolated sandbox without giving it any real data, such as our location. We ran a network traffic analysis to understand what data was flowing in and out of the WebDetetive app, which found it was a largely repackaged copy of OwnSpy’s spyware. WebDetetive’s user agent, which it sends to the server to identify itself, was still referring to itself as OwnSpy, even though it was uploading our virtual device’s dummy data to WebDetetive’s servers.\nA side-by-side photo comparison of WebDetetive (left) and OwnSpy (right) running on Android. Image Credits: TechCrunch\nOwnSpy is developed in Spain by Mobile Innovations, a Madrid-based company run by Antonio Calatrava. OwnSpy has operated since at least 2010, according to its website, and claims to have 50,000 customers, though it’s not known how many devices OwnSpy has compromised to date.\nOwnSpy also operates an affiliate model, allowing others to make a commission by promoting the app or offering “a new product to your clients” in return for OwnSpy taking a cut of the profits, according to an archived copy of its affiliate’s website. It’s not clear what other operational links, if any, exist between OwnSpy and WebDetetive. Calatrava did not return a request for comment.\nA short time after we emailed Calatrava, portions of OwnSpy’s known infrastructure dropped offline. A separate network traffic analysis of OwnSpy’s app by TechCrunch found that OwnSpy’s spyware app was briefly nonfunctional at the time of publication. WebDetetive’s app continues to function.\nDestructive attack?\nWebDetetive is the second spyware maker to be targeted by a data-destructive hack in recent months. LetMeSpy, a spyware app developed by Polish developer Rafal Lidwin, shut down following a hack that exposed and deleted victims’ stolen phone data from LetMeSpy’s servers. Lidwin declined to answer questions about the incident.\nBy TechCrunch’s count, at least a dozen spyware companies in recent years have exposed, spilled, or otherwise put victims’ stolen phone data at risk of further compromise because of shoddy coding and easily exploitable security vulnerabilities.\nWebDetetive founder Leonardo Duarte did not respond to a request for comment. An email sent to WebDetetive’s support email address about the data breach — including whether the spyware maker has backups — went unreturned. It’s not clear if the spyware maker will notify customers or victims of the data breach, or if it still has the data or records to do so.\nDestructive attacks, although infrequent, could have unintended and dangerous consequences for victims of spyware. Spyware typically alerts the abuser if the spyware app stops working or is removed from a victim’s phone, and severing a connection without a safety plan in place could put spyware victims in an unsafe situation. The Coalition Against Stalkerware, which works to support victims and survivors of stalkerware, has resources on its website for those who suspect their phone is compromised.\nHow to find and remove WebDetetive\nUnlike most phone monitoring apps, WebDetetive and OwnSpy do not hide their app on an Android home screen, but instead disguise themselves as an Android system-presenting Wi-Fi app.\nWebDetetive is relatively easy to detect. The app appears named as “WiFi” and features a white wireless icon in a blue circle on a white background.\nA screenshot showing the “WiFi” app, which presents as a system Wi-Fi app. However, this app is spyware in disguise. Image Credits: TechCrunch\nWhen tapped and held, and the app info is viewed, the app is actually called “Sistema.”\nThis “WiFi” app icon, when tapped, will actually show as an app called “Sistema,” designed to look like an Android system app, but is actually WebDetetive spyware.

You should ensure that Google Play Protect is switched on, as this on-device security feature can defend against malicious Android apps.

{"num":87,"Time":"2:17 AM GMT+1•December 21, 2018","Title":"At Blind, a security lapse revealed private complaints from Silicon Valley employees","Content":"Thousands of people trusted Blind, an app-based “anonymous social network,” as a safe way to reveal malfeasance, wrongdoing and improper conduct at their companies.\nBut Blind left one of its database servers exposed without a password, making it possible (for anyone who knew where to look) to access each user’s account information and identify would-be whistleblowers.\nThe South Korea-founded company made its way into the U.S. in 2015, when it quickly became a highly popular anonymous social network for major tech companies, touting employees from Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Uber and more. Blind last month secured another $10 million in new funding after a $6 million raise in 2017. But it was only when the social network became the root of several high-profile scandals that Blind gained mainstream attention, including revealing allegations of sexual harassment at Uber — which later blocked the app on its corporate network.\nThe exposed server was found by a security researcher, who goes by the name Mossab H, who informed the company of the security lapse. The security researcher found one of the company’s Kibana dashboards for its backend ElasticSearch database, which contained several tables, including private messaging data and web-based content, for both of its U.S. and Korean sites. Blind said the exposure only affects users who signed up or logged in between November 1 and December 19, and that the exposure relates to “a single server, one among many servers on our platform,” according to Blind executive Kyum Kim in an email.\nBlind only pulled the database after TechCrunch followed up by email a week later.

{"num":88,"Time":"7:00 PM GMT+2•September 6, 2022","Title":"Parsing Samsung’s data breach notice","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Chung Sung-Jun\n(opens in a new window)\n\/ Getty Images\nHours before a long holiday weekend in the United States, electronics giant Samsung announced its U.S. systems were breached a month earlier by malicious hackers, who broke in and made off with gobs of personal information about an unspecified number of its customers.\nThe data breach is likely significant. Samsung is one of the largest technology companies with hundreds of millions of device owners — and users — around the world. But Samsung’s poorly explained data breach notice, coupled with its unexplained delay in disclosing the data breach, left customers reading the tea-leaves and without a clear idea of what they can do to protect themselves, if at all.\nTechCrunch has marked up and annotated Samsung’s data breach notice 🖍️ with our analysis of what it means — and what Samsung leaves out.\nSpokespeople for Samsung, via crisis communications firm Edelman, declined to answer the questions we sent prior to publication, citing the “ongoing nature of our coordination with law enforcement.”\nWhat Samsung said in its data breach notice\nSamsung knows it security incident is a data breach\nNot all security incidents are created equally. Malicious hackers don’t always steal data; it depends on how a company’s systems and network is set up and how far the hackers get. In this case, Samsung knows that data was “acquired” 🖍️ — or exfiltrated — by the hackers.\nRemember, this is only the initial breach disclosure. Samsung is providing the very minimum of what the company has to tell you. The fact that hackers accessed customers’ personal information either shows Samsung did not protect that data as well as it should, or that the hackers had such deep access to Samsung’s network that they were able to access customer data and presumably other highly sensitive files. This is also Samsung’s second known data breach this year after the Lapsus$ hacking crew stole source code and other confidential internal documents from the company’s systems in March, though no customer information was taken.\nCustomers’ personal information was stolen\nSamsung says in its data breach notice 🖍️ that the hackers “in some cases” took customer names, contact and demographic information, date of birth, and product registration information. That suggests not every Samsung customer is affected, but it could also mean that Samsung does not yet know how much data was stolen in its data breach.\nNames and dates of birth are personal information. It is less clear what other data was stolen, but the clues are in the privacy policy.\nSamsung previously told TechCrunch that customers provide information when registering their devices to access “service and support, warranty information, software updates, and exclusive offers for the purchase of future Samsung products.” This data includes the Samsung product model, date of purchase, and the device’s unique identifier, such as an IMEI number for phones and advertising IDs, or serial numbers for other devices like smart TVs.\nUnique identifiers are designed to be pseudonymous so that in the event of a data breach, these randomized strings of letters and numbers wouldn’t be of much use. But unique identifiers are not fully anonymized and can be combined with other data for targeted advertising or for identifying users or tracking someone’s online activity.\nDemographic data includes precise geolocation data\nSamsung’s data breach notice includes a vague mention of “demographic information” that was stolen by the hackers. Samsung says it collects this unspecified demographic information 🖍️ to “help deliver the best experience possible with our products and services” — or another way of saying targeted advertising.\nSamsung’s U.S. privacy policy explains this more explicitly. “Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests, and browsing context. These networks can track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, pixels, device identifiers, server logs, and other similar technologies.”\nSamsung declined to tell TechCrunch what specific data “demographic information” includes, but there are more clues in the company’s separate privacy policy for advertising, which it links to in the data breach notice and explains what demographic information includes.\nThe list is long, and you should take the time to read it closely for yourself. The abridged version is that Samsung collects technical information about your phone or other device, how you use your device, like which apps you have installed and which websites you visit, and how you interact with ads, which are used by advertisers and data brokers to infer information about you. The data can also include your “precise geolocation data,” which can be used to identify where you go and who you meet with. Samsung says it collects information about what you watch on its smart TVs, including which channels and programs you’ve watched.\nSamsung also says it “may obtain other behavioral and demographic data from trusted third-party data sources,” which means Samsung buys data from other companies and combines it with its own stores of customer information to learn more about you, again for targeted advertising. Samsung would not say which companies, such as data brokers, it obtains this data from.\nBut that same data in the hands of bad actors can reveal a lot about a person and their online habits.\nWhy doesn’t Samsung just say any of this in its data breach notice? While the data may not be personally identifiable, it’s still personal in nature since it is linked to tastes, preferences and our real-world activity, which is why the nitty-gritty details of what companies like Samsung collect about you is often buried in the privacy policies that nobody reads (and we’re all guilty of this).\nSamsung declined to say if data sourced from third-parties was compromised in its breach, but did not dispute our characterizations when spokespeople were reached prior to publication.\nWhat Samsung isn’t saying in its data breach notice\nSamsung won’t say how many customers are affected\nSamsung declined to tell TechCrunch how many customers are affected by the breach. It could be that either Samsung doesn’t know, which is unlikely since it has already emailed customers it believes are affected. Or, what is more likely 🖍️, is that the number of customers affected is so large that Samsung doesn’t want you to know because the company would find it embarrassing.\nSamsung has hundreds of millions of users, but seldom breaks out how many customers it has. Even 1% of affected customers could still amount to millions, or tens of millions of affected users.\nIt’s unclear why Social Security numbers are mentioned\nThe data breach notice conspicuously notes 🖍️ that the breach “did not impact Social Security numbers or credit and debit card numbers.” Reassuring on the face of it, but the wording is unclear. TechCrunch asked Samsung if it collects and stores Social Security numbers and that this data is unaffected, but the company declined to say — only that the issue “did not impact” Social Security numbers. Samsung collects Social Security numbers as part of its financing options and as a requirement for users of Samsung Money.\nWhy did it take a month to notify customers?\nLooking at the timeline of the breach 🖍️, Samsung says the hackers stole data in “late July 2022,” which a generous reading could interpret as any point past the middle of July. Samsung could disclose the date — if it knows it. It’s also worth noting that this is the date that Samsung says that data was exfiltrated from its network and this does not include how much time the hackers spent in Samsung’s systems before they were finally discovered. It discovered the exfiltration of data on August 4, which means Samsung did not know for weeks that customer data had been stolen.\nAs for disclosing the breach a month later, just hours before close of business on a Friday before a long holiday weekend? Well, that’s just bad PR.\nSamsung updated its privacy policy as it disclosed its breach\nOn the same day it announced its data breach, Samsung also pushed a new privacy policy to its users. Thanks to a reader who alerted TechCrunch to this, the new policy now explicitly states 🖍️ that Samsung can use a customer’s “precise geolocation” for marketing and advertising with the user’s consent. The new policy also now spells out 🖍️ for how long Samsung stores data that users share from the Quick Share feature. Samsung says it may “collect the contents you share, which will remain available for 3 days.”\nTechCrunch asked Samsung how it defines what it defines as user consent, but a spokesperson would not say. Samsung would not say for what reason it pushed a new privacy policy, but claimed the update was “unrelated” to the incident and was previously planned.\nIf you know more about Samsung’s data breach or work at Samsung, you can contact this author via Signal at +1 646.755.8849 or via SecureDrop.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": {\n\"Reason\": \"The news is about a data breach involving Samsung, which is relevant to Location data exposure because it mentions the collection of precise geolocation data and demographic information by Samsung.\",\n\"Details\": \"Samsung's data breach notice mentions that the hackers stole 'demographic information' and 'precise geolocation data.'

It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.\nThose whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a \"quite significant\" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.\nOptus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported.\nIn an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a \"sophisticated attack\", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nABC NEWS\nImage caption,\nOptus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said she was \"devastated\" by the breach\n\"Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it,\" she said on Friday.\nThen a ransom threat was made\nEarly on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.\nThe company had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.\nInvestigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.\nSydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.\nThe user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was \"sophisticated\", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface.\n\"No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use,\" they said in a message, according to Kirk.\nAs data circulates, revelations of more stolen details\nIn another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.\nBut just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a \"mistake\" - and deleted the previously posted data sets.\n\"Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone,\" they posted. \"Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this.\"\nThat sparked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.\nAdding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.\nIt also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose.\nLate on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.\n'Potentially Australia's most serious breach'\nOptus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week.\nPeople have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion.\nA class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. \"This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed,\" said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.\nThe government has called the breach \"unprecedented\" and blamed Optus, saying it \"effectively left the window open\" for sensitive data to be stolen.\nIn an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: \"You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?\"\n\"Well, it wasn't. So no,\" Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online.\nSkip twitter post by Clare O'Neil MP\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter.

So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there.\n\"I think most customers understand that we are not the villains,\" she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.\nThe company has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.\n'A decade behind on cyber-security'\nThe breach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says.\n\"We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be,\" she told the ABC.\nAustralia probes firms over customer 'faceprints'\nAustralia's Nine TV network hit by cyber-attack\nBoth sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is \"asleep at the wheel\", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.\nMs O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.\nShe argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.\nShe also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies.\n\"At the time, the telecommunications sector said: \"Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question.\"\nSecurity experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.\nOptus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.\nOther industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator.\nRelated Topics\nData breaches\nCyber-security\nMore on this story\nCould my BeReal get me sacked?\nPublished\n7 September 2022\nHow your data is being scraped from social media\nPublished\n16 July 2021\nDon’t underestimate Russian cyber-threat, warns US\nPublished\n11 May 2022\nThe three Russian cyber-attacks the West most fears\nPublished\n22 March 2022","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Location data exposure because it discusses a massive data breach at Australian telecommunications giant Optus, which has affected about 10 million customers, approximately 40% of the country's population.

{"num":92,"Time":"4:15 PM GMT+2•October 21, 2019","Title":"NordVPN confirms it was hacked","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Getty Images\nNordVPN, a virtual private network provider that promises to “protect your privacy online,” has confirmed it was hacked.\nThe admission comes following rumors that the company had been breached. It first emerged that NordVPN had an expired internal private key exposed, potentially allowing anyone to spin out their own servers imitating NordVPN.\nVPN providers are increasingly popular as they ostensibly provide privacy from your internet provider and visiting sites about your internet browsing traffic. That’s why journalists and activists often use these services, particularly when they’re working in hostile states. These providers channel all of your internet traffic through one encrypted pipe, making it more difficult for anyone on the internet to see which sites you are visiting or which apps you are using. But often that means displacing your browsing history from your internet provider to your VPN provider. That’s left many providers open to scrutiny, as often it’s not clear if each provider is logging every site a user visits.\nFor its part, NordVPN has claimed a “zero logs” policy. “We don’t track, collect, or share your private data,” the company says.\nBut the breach is likely to cause alarm that hackers may have been in a position to access some user data.\nNordVPN told TechCrunch that one of its data centers was accessed in March 2018. “One of the data centers in Finland we are renting our servers from was accessed with no authorization,” said NordVPN spokesperson Laura Tyrell.\nThe attacker gained access to the server — which had been active for about a month — by exploiting an insecure remote management system left by the data center provider; NordVPN said it was unaware that such a system existed.\nNordVPN did not name the data center provider.\n“The server itself did not contain any user activity logs; none of our applications send user-created credentials for authentication, so usernames and passwords couldn’t have been intercepted either,” said the spokesperson. “On the same note, the only possible way to abuse the website traffic was by performing a personalized and complicated man-in-the-middle attack to intercept a single connection that tried to access NordVPN.”\nAccording to the spokesperson, the expired private key could not have been used to decrypt the VPN traffic on any other server.\nNordVPN said it found out about the breach a “few months ago,” but the spokesperson said the breach was not disclosed until today because the company wanted to be “100% sure that each component within our infrastructure is secure.”\nA senior security researcher we spoke to who reviewed the statement and other evidence of the breach, but asked not to be named as they work for a company that requires authorization to speak to the press, called these findings “troubling.”\n“While this is unconfirmed and we await further forensic evidence, this is an indication of a full remote compromise of this provider’s systems,” the security researcher said. “That should be deeply concerning to anyone who uses or promotes these particular services.”\nNordVPN said “no other server on our network has been affected.”\nBut the security researcher warned that NordVPN was ignoring the larger issue of the attacker’s possible access across the network. “Your car was just stolen and taken on a joy ride and you’re quibbling about which buttons were pushed on the radio?” the researcher said.\nThe company confirmed it had installed intrusion detection systems, a popular technology that companies use to detect early breaches, but “no-one could know about an undisclosed remote management system left by the [data center] provider,” said the spokesperson.\nNordVPN said it disputes this. “We treat VPN servers as untrusted in the rest of our infrastructure. It is not possible to get access to other VPN servers, users database or any other server from a compromised VPN server,” said the spokesperson.\n“They spent millions on ads, but apparently nothing on effective defensive security,” the researcher said.\nNordVPN was recently recommended by TechRadar and PCMag. CNET described it as its “favorite” VPN provider.\nIt’s also believed several other VPN providers may have been breached around the same time. Similar records posted online — and seen by TechCrunch — suggest that TorGuard and VikingVPN may have also been compromised.\nA spokesperson for TorGuard told TechCrunch that a “single server” was compromised in 2017 but denied that any VPN traffic was accessed. TorGuard also put out an extensive statement following a May blog post, which first revealed the breach.\nUpdated with comment from TorGuard, and again with additional comment from NordVPN.\nGot a tip?

{"num":74,"Time":"SEPTEMBER 8, 2017","Title":"Equifax data breach liability could hinge on where case is tried","Content":"By Alison Frankel\n(Reuters) - Less than a day after Equifax revealed one of the biggest data breaches in U.S. corporate history, the credit reporting company has already been hit with two proposed class actions in federal court – and one of those cases was filed by consumer lawyers who just won the right to move forward with gargantuan data breach litigation against Yahoo.\nThat’s an ominous development for Equifax. And you can be sure there will be more suits to come.\nEquifax said hackers accessed files that contained the names, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers of as many as 143 million U.S. consumers. The profusion of potential data breach victims will attract lots of lawyers who will probably file lots more proposed class actions. (Equifax did not respond to a request for comment on the litigation from my Reuters colleague Jon Stempel.)\nEventually, if recent data breach litigation against Anthem, Yahoo and Target is a guide, the Equifax cases will be consolidated by a panel of federal judges who will transfer the cases to a single federal court. That court will rule on the crucial early-stage motions that will shape Equifax’s liability to the millions of consumers whose data has been compromised.\nThat’s where things could get very interesting. In data breach litigation, the answer to a threshold question about who has the right to sue depends on which court is hearing the case. If litigation against Equifax ends up in Chicago, for example, data breach victims must only show they are at risk of identity theft to establish the constitutional right to sue in federal court, otherwise known as standing. But in Richmond, Virginia, heightened risk isn’t enough to satisfy standing requirements.\nFederal appellate courts are deeply divided on the question of who has standing to sue over data breaches. Several federal circuits, including the 3rd, 6th, 7th and District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal, have held in the past two years that the mere increased risk of identity theft or credit card fraud gives consumers a threshold right to bring a class action.\nThose rulings make it much easier to move forward with data breach litigation because lawyers representing consumers whose personal information has been stolen don’t have to show their clients’ data has actually been misused. Getting class actions past the threshold requirement can, in turn, lead to quicker, larger settlements.\nThis summer, for instance, the insurer Anthem agreed to a record-setting $115 million settlement of data-breach litigation consolidated in federal court in San Jose. The 9th Circuit, which encompasses California, has held that data breach victims meet standing requirements if they can show “a credible threat of real and immediate harm.”\nThe 2nd, 4th and 8th Circuits don’t buy that reasoning. They have all recently held that risk alone - without allegations that personal information has actually been misused – is not an adequately concrete injury to allow consumers to sue.\nEquifax is based in Atlanta, which is located in the 11th Circuit. That appeals court most recently ruled on standing for data breach victims in 2012, in a proposed class action called Resnick v. AvMed, which involved the theft of two laptops containing personal information about clients of AvMed, a healthcare provider.\nThe AvMed clients who filed the case claimed their information had already been misused. AvMed argued that they didn’t meet constitutional standing requirements because they couldn’t show the supposed misuse stemmed from the theft of AvMed laptops. The 11th Circuit concluded that data breach victims do not have to prove such a link in order to establish their threshold right to sue.\nBut the Resnick opinion did not address the question of standing for data breach victims whose information has only been stolen but not yet misused – which is what consumers are alleging in the two Equifax proposed class actions that have already been filed. At least one federal district judge in the 11th Circuit has found, in a 2016 decision, that the risk of identity theft after a data breach is not enough to give consumers a right to sue.\nSooner or later, the U.S. Supreme Court will probably have to resolve uncertainty among the federal appellate courts on the standing of data breach victims facing increased risk of identity theft. The health insurer CareFirst, which last month lost an appeal at the D.C. Circuit in which it tried to bounce a data breach class action, has informed the appeals court that it intends to ask the justices to hear the issue.\nPossible Supreme Court involvement is just one of the factors that will ultimately determine the magnitude of Equifax’s litigation exposure to consumers. (Another could be Equifax’s terms of service, which include a provision that appears to require consumers enrolling in a complimentary monitoring service called TrustedID Premier to waive their class action rights and submit disputes to arbitration.) These big data breach class actions are typically measured in years, not weeks or even months.\nBut keep an eye on which court ends up overseeing the consolidated litigation. In data breach class actions, as in real estate, much depends on location, location, location.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Location data exposure because it discusses the Equifax data breach, which involved the exposure of sensitive personal information, including names, Social Security numbers, and driver's license numbers of as many as 143 million U.S. consumers.

Users whose accounts were affected will be notified by Facebook. Those users will be logged out of their accounts and required to log back in.\n“I’m glad we found this and fixed the vulnerability,” Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call with reporters on Friday morning. “But it definitely is an issue that this happened in the first place. I think this underscores the attacks that our community and our services face.”\nThe security breach is believed to be the largest in Facebook’s history and is particularly severe because the attackers stole “access tokens”, a kind of security key that allows users to stay logged into Facebook over multiple browsing sessions without entering their password every time. Possessing a token allows an attacker to take full control of the victim’s account, including logging into third-party applications that use Facebook Login.\nThe security breach comes at a time of significant strife for the social media company, which has faced mounting criticism over issues including foreign election interference, the flow of misinformation, hate speech, and data privacy.\nThe revelation that a political consultancy linked to the US president, Donald Trump, had obtained the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users prompted widespread concern that the company was cavalier in its approach to privacy.\nInstagram founders quit amid suspected clash with Zuckerberg\nRead more\n“We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg wrote in a public apology regarding the Cambridge Analytica breach.\nAccording to Facebook, the attacker exploited three bugs that were introduced into the site’s “view as” feature in July 2017. “View as” allows users to see what their profile looks like to other users. The company does not yet know when the hack took place, but it said that it began an investigation after discovering unusual activity on 16 September.\nIn addition to the 50m accounts whose access tokens were taken, Facebook said that it would require 40m additional users who used the “view as” tool since July 2017 to log out of their accounts as a precaution. This will reset those users’ access tokens, protecting their accounts.\nThe company has notified law enforcement, the vice-president of product management, Guy Rosen, said on the conference call. Rosen said that Facebook was working with the FBI, but he did not comment on whether national security agencies were involved in the investigation.\n“The investigation is early, and it’s hard to discover who is behind this,” Rosen said. “We may never know.” He did note that the scale and complexity of the hack would have required “a certain level” of expertise.\nThe breach was discovered by Facebook engineers on 25 September. Photograph: Regis Duvignau\/Reuters\nDr Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity and privacy researcher, said: “Anyone involved in this hack knew what he was doing.” Olejnik noted that whoever discovered the vulnerabilities would probably have been eligible for a “bug bounty” payment had they disclosed the bugs rather than exploited them.\nAnother key area of investigation is discovering the extent to which the hackers used the access tokens. The company says it has not yet seen evidence that the hackers accessed private messages or made posts on users’ behalf, but they did attempt to access certain profile information.\nRosen did not provide any details on the location of users affected, saying only that the attack seemed “broad” and investigators had not determined whether there were particular targets. The company has notified the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) about the breach. The implementation of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) meant that Facebook was required to notify data protection authorities within 72 hours if any affected users were in the European Economic Area.\nThe Irish DPC was critical in its initial response to the breach, tweeting: “At present Facebook is unable to clarify the nature of the breach & risk to users. We are pressing Facebook to urgently clarify these matters.\nNews of the hack comes at the end of a week in which many of Facebook’s Silicon Valley peers testified before the US Congress about the possibility of consumer privacy regulations.\n“Today’s disclosure is a reminder about the dangers posed when a small number of companies like Facebook or the credit bureau Equifax are able to accumulate so much personal data about individual Americans without adequate security measures,” said the US senator Mark Warner in a statement. “This is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users.”\nFacebook shares fell about 3% following the disclosure.\nArticles about the data breach by the Guardian and the Associated Press were temporarily flagged as spam on Facebook, preventing users from sharing news of the attack on their profiles. The company attributed the error to its “automated systems” and apologized, but did not provide further explanation.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Location data exposure because it discusses a significant security breach on Facebook, where nearly 50 million user accounts were compromised.

(Reuters) - Authorities in 23 countries across five continents have sought access to contact tracing technology from Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, the companies announced on Wednesday as they released the initial version of their system.\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\nBut authorities would have to stop requiring phone numbers from users under the companies’ rules, one of several restrictions that have left governments fighting the novel coronavirus frustrated that the world’s top two smartphone software makers undercut the technology’s usefulness by prioritizing user privacy.\nApple and Google said several U.S. states and 22 countries have sought access to their technology, but it is unclear how many will end up publishing mobile apps that use it.\nUsing apps to accelerate contact tracing, in which authorities identify and test people who were recently near a virus carrier, has emerged as a tool to stem new outbreaks.

{"num":4,"Time":"Published 12:15 AM GMT+2, August 14, 2018","Title":"AP Exclusive: Google tracks your movements, like it or not","Content":"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.\nAn Associated Press investigation found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you’ve used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.\nComputer-science researchers at Princeton confirmed these findings at the AP’s request.\nFor the most part, Google is upfront about asking permission to use your location information. An app like Google Maps will remind you to allow access to location if you use it for navigating. If you agree to let it record your location over time, Google Maps will display that history for you in a “timeline” that maps out your daily movements.\n&lt;!-- The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: --&gt; Your browser does not support the &lt;code&gt;iframe&lt;\/code&gt; HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.\nStoring your minute-by-minute travels carries privacy risks and has been used by police to determine the location of suspects — such as a warrant that police in Raleigh, North Carolina, served on Google last year to find devices near a murder scene. So the company lets you “pause” a setting called Location History.\nGoogle says that will prevent the company from remembering where you’ve been. Google’s support page on the subject states: “You can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.”\nThat isn’t true. Even with Location History paused, some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking. (It’s possible, although laborious, to delete it .)\nFor example, Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you merely open its Maps app. Automatic daily weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where you are. And some searches that have nothing to do with location, like “chocolate chip cookies,” or “kids science kits,” pinpoint your precise latitude and longitude — accurate to the square foot — and save it to your Google account.\nThe privacy issue affects some two billion users of devices that run Google’s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.\nStoring location data in violation of a user’s preferences is wrong, said Jonathan Mayer, a Princeton computer scientist and former chief technologist for the Federal Communications Commission’s enforcement bureau. A researcher from Mayer’s lab confirmed the AP’s findings on multiple Android devices; the AP conducted its own tests on several iPhones that found the same behavior.\n“If you’re going to allow users to turn off something called ‘Location History,’ then all the places where you maintain location history should be turned off,” Mayer said. “That seems like a pretty straightforward position to have.”\nGoogle says it is being perfectly clear.\n“There are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people’s experience, including: Location History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to the AP. “We provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.”\nGoogle’s explanation did not convince several lawmakers.\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia told the AP it is “frustratingly common” for technology companies “to have corporate practices that diverge wildly from the totally reasonable expectations of their users,” and urged policies that would give users more control of their data. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey called for “comprehensive consumer privacy and data security legislation” in the wake of the AP report.\nTo stop Google from saving these location markers, the company says, users can turn off another setting, one that does not specifically reference location information. Called “Web and App Activity” and enabled by default, that setting stores a variety of information from Google apps and websites to your Google account.\nWhen paused, it will prevent activity on any device from being saved to your account. But leaving “Web & App Activity” on and turning “Location History” off only prevents Google from adding your movements to the “timeline,” its visualization of your daily travels. It does not stop Google’s collection of other location markers.\nYou can delete these location markers by hand, but it’s a painstaking process since you have to select them individually, unless you want to delete all of your stored activity.\nYou can see the stored location markers on a page in your Google account at myactivity.google.com, although they’re typically scattered under several different headers, many of which are unrelated to location.\nTo demonstrate how powerful these other markers can be, the AP created a visual map of the movements of Princeton postdoctoral researcher Gunes Acar, who carried an Android phone with Location history off, and shared a record of his Google account.\nThe map includes Acar’s train commute on two trips to New York and visits to The High Line park, Chelsea Market, Hell’s Kitchen, Central Park and Harlem. To protect his privacy, The AP didn’t plot the most telling and frequent marker — his home address.\nHuge tech companies are under increasing scrutiny over their data practices, following a series of privacy scandals at Facebook and new data-privacy rules recently adopted by the European Union. Last year, the business news site Quartz found that Google was tracking Android users by collecting the addresses of nearby cellphone towers even if all location services were off. Google changed the practice and insisted it never recorded the data anyway.\nCritics say Google’s insistence on tracking its users’ locations stems from its drive to boost advertising revenue.\n“They build advertising information out of data,” said Peter Lenz, the senior geospatial analyst at Dstillery, a rival advertising technology company. “More data for them presumably means more profit.”\nThe AP learned of the issue from K. Shankari, a graduate researcher at UC Berkeley who studies the commuting patterns of volunteers in order to help urban planners. She noticed that her Android phone prompted her to rate a shopping trip to Kohl’s, even though she had turned Location History off.\n“So how did Google Maps know where I was?” she asked in a blog post .\nThe AP wasn’t able to recreate Shankari’s experience exactly. But its attempts to do so revealed Google’s tracking. The findings disturbed her.\n“I am not opposed to background location tracking in principle,” she said. “It just really bothers me that it is not explicitly stated.”\nGoogle offers a more accurate description of how Location History actually works in a place you’d only see if you turn it off — a popup that appears when you “pause” Location History on your Google account webpage . There the company notes that “some location data may be saved as part of your activity on other Google services, like Search and Maps.”\nGoogle offers additional information in a popup that appears if you re-activate the “Web & App Activity” setting — an uncommon action for many users, since this setting is on by default. That popup states that, when active, the setting “saves the things you do on Google sites, apps, and services ... and associated information, like location.”\nWarnings when you’re about to turn Location History off via Android and iPhone device settings are more difficult to interpret. On Android, the popup explains that “places you go with your devices will stop being added to your Location History map.” On the iPhone, it simply reads, “None of your Google apps will be able to store location data in Location History.”\nThe iPhone text is technically true if potentially misleading. With Location History off, Google Maps and other apps store your whereabouts in a section of your account called “My Activity,” not “Location History.”\nSince 2014, Google has let advertisers track the effectiveness of online ads at driving foot traffic , a feature that Google has said relies on user location histories.\nThe company is pushing further into such location-aware tracking to drive ad revenue, which rose 20 percent last year to $95.4 billion. At a Google Marketing Live summit in July, Google executives unveiled a new tool called “local campaigns” that dynamically uses ads to boost in-person store visits.

For an alternative view on this issue, see GPS should be fair game in police probes\nSTORY HIGHLIGHTS\nShould law enforcement need a warrant before planting a GPS tracking device on a car?\nYes, the Supreme Court ought to decide that they should, says Catherine Crump\nThe principle at stake in a current case may well shape our privacy rights, she says\nAll of us can already easily be tracked through our cell phones, Crump says\nCNN\n — \nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court will confront the profound impact of new location-tracking technologies on Americans’ privacy. The case, U.S. v. Jones, presents the question of whether law enforcement needs a warrant before planting a GPS tracking device on a person’s car. The answer to this question is important in its own right, but the case is likely to have broader implications.\nAttaching a GPS to a car isn’t the only way the government can track people’s movements. In fact, everyone with a cell phone is already carrying a device that the government can use to track his or her location. As a result, the principle at stake in this case may well shape our privacy rights in the years and decades to come.\nThe police in the current case suspected Antoine Jones of drug violations and tracked his movements continuously for one month by installing a GPS device on his car. Increasingly, though, law enforcement agents are tracking our movements by tracking the cell phones that most people are already carrying around.\nCatherine Crump\nIt doesn’t matter whether your phone is a smartphone or whether you use it to make calls; as long as your phone is turned on, it registers its location with cell phone networks several times a minute, and all U.S. cell phone companies hold on to that data, some of them for years.\nThis kind of tracking is extremely invasive, because if the government knows where you are, it knows who you are. As the Jones appellate court explained in its ruling that the government violated the Fourth Amendment, “A person who knows all of another’s travels can deduce whether he is a weekly churchgoer, a heavy drinker, a regular at the gym, an unfaithful husband, an outpatient receiving medical treatment, an associate of particular individuals or political groups – and not just one such fact about a person, but all such facts.”\nCell phone tracking can reveal our private associations and relationships with one another. The government could make note of whenever people being tracked crossed path or spent time together, showing who our friends, associates and lovers are.\nThe Justice Department sometimes gets warrants to track location, and some local police departments make it a policy, which shows that it’s not an unworkable requirement. But state and federal judges across the country have made conflicting rulings on what standards are required for the government to obtain tracking information from cell phone companies.\nNew technology provides the government with a powerful and inexpensive tool to follow individuals as they travel through both public and private areas. Unless the court concludes that such tracking requires a warrant, anyone’s movements could be subject to remote monitoring and permanent recording at the sole discretion of any curious police officer, without any judicial oversight.\nAnd while it may not be realistic to think that the government will install a GPS device on every car, it’s not at all implausible to think that the government will ask cell phone providers to turn over location-tracking information en masse – and it may well be the case that the government is doing so already. It was revealed last month that the London police have a system that lets them track hundreds of phones in real time in a targeted geographic area, a technology that could easily enable the government to identify everyone at an Occupy protest, tea party rally or any other political gathering.\nThe genius of the Constitution is that its limits on the government can still be applied in a modern world that the framers could scarcely have imagined. Anyone who values privacy should hope that the Court ensures the government cannot use technological advances to undermine the liberties this country was founded on.\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Catherine Crump.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about location tracking privacy issues.

A lack of regulation means that policies governing how long our location data is kept vary widely,” the ACLU said.\nThe civil liberties group is advocating legislation regulating the use of the technology.\nThe readers have been proliferating at “worrying speed” and are typically mounted on bridges, overpasses and patrol cars, the ACLU said.\nThe devices use high-speed cameras, and the software analyzes the photographs to retrieve the plate number, the group said.\nLawsuit by 19 groups seeks to halt NSA snooping\nThe system then runs the data against “hot lists” of plate numbers and produces an instant alert when a match, or “hit,” registers, the group said. The hot lists include the National Crime Information Center ﬁle, which includes stolen cars and vehicles used in the commission of a crime.\n“License plate readers would pose few civil liberties risks if they only checked plates against hot lists and these hot lists were implemented soundly. But these systems are conﬁgured to store the photograph, the license plate number, and the date, time, and location where all vehicles are seen — not just the data of vehicles that generate hits,” the ACLU report said.\nThe growing collection of data allows police to create “a single, high-resolution image of our lives,” and the constant monitoring “can chill the exercise of our cherished rights to free speech and association,” the group said.\n“If not properly secured, license plate reader databases open the door to abusive tracking, enabling anyone with access to pry into the lives of his boss, his ex-wife, or his romantic, political, or workplace rivals,” the ACLU said.\nLaw enforcement argues the tools keep officers and the public safe.\nIn a blog post last week, the Los Angeles Police Protective League said that license plate recognition (LPR) technology has helped with “literally thousands of cases nationwide.”\n“LPR is not an invasion of privacy, but rather a tool for law enforcement to better accomplish its mission to protect and serve. The onus is on law enforcement agencies and governing bodies to ensure that they have proper policies in place for disciplined and responsible use, with appropriate punishments for anyone operating outside of policy,” the union said.\nThe ACLU report cited how the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2012 tracked the movement of the Mayor R.T. Rybak’s car 41 times at a license police reader in the prior year. The newspaper put the information on a map and gathered the data through public records requests.\nThe newspaper found that the police department’s plate readers yielded hits of fewer than 1% of the 805,000 plate scans made in June 2012, according to the ACLU.\nA hit means that a read matched a listing in a database of vehicles law enforcement was interested in, for whatever reason. They might be reported stolen, for instance, or belonging to missing persons.\nAs a result, the mayor directed the police chief to recommend a new policy on data retention, the group said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Based on the provided news article, it is relevant to location tracking privacy issues.

{"num":8,"Time":"4:55 PM GMT+2•July 5, 2023","Title":"Meta’s Threads app is a privacy nightmare that won’t launch in EU yet","Content":"cameraImage Credits: TechCrunch\nMeta’s planned Twitter killer, Threads, isn’t yet publicly available but it already looks like a privacy nightmare.\nInformation provided about the app’s privacy via mandatory disclosures required on iOS shows the app may collect highly sensitive information about users in order to profile their digital activity — including health and financial data, precise location, browsing history, contacts, search history and other sensitive information.\nGiven that Meta, the developer behind the app, the company formerly known as Facebook, makes its money from tracking and profiling web users to sell their attention via its behavioral advertising microtargeting tools this is hardly surprising. But it does raise questions over whether Threads will be able to launch in the European Union where the legal basis Meta had claimed for processing Facebook users’ personal data (performance of a contract) was found unlawful at the start of this year.\nMeta has since switched to a claim of legitimate interest for this data-for-ads processing. But, earlier this week, the bloc’s top court piled more regional woe on Meta via a judgement on a German case referral where the Court said this legal basis is not appropriate for running Meta’s behavioral ads either and consent needs to be sought. Under current EU law, sensitive information such as health data also requires an even higher standard of explicit consent to be legally processed in order to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation. So Meta would need to ask and obtain specific permission for processing sensitive data like health into.\nAdditionally, incoming EU regulations ban use of sensitive data for ads entirely and may require explicit consent for tech giants to combine data for ad profiling (see: the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act). So there’s even more regional legal uncertainty looming on the horizon for Meta’s people farming business. (Designated gatekeepers must be compliant with the DMA by next spring; while so-called very large online platforms need to meet obligations under the DSA by August 25.)\nCurrently, the adtech giant does not even offer users a general, up-front choice to deny its tracking and profiling, let alone explicitly ask if it can share data on your health conditions so advertisers can try to sell you diet pills or whatever. And with even harder limits on surveillance ads coming down the pipe in the EU an app that proposes to track everything to maximize its appeal to advertisers will be a tough sell to regional regulators.\nPlus — as if that wasn’t enough — Meta was recently hit with an order to stop sending EU users data to the US for processing and fined almost $1.3BN for breaching the GDPR’s requirements on data exports. That order is specific to Facebook but, in principle, the same requirement could be applied to other Meta services that don’t adequately protect Europeans’ data over the pond (such as by using zero knowledge architecture end-to-end encryption). And, clearly, Threads isn’t going to offer users that kind of privacy.\nBringing Meta’s surveillance ads business into compliance with EU law is going to require a sea-change in how it operates — one which does not appear to be its plan with Threads, given it’s presenting more of the same data-grabbing attention farming that’s gained Mark Zuckerberg’s empire such a toxic rep it had to undergo an expensive corporate rebrand to Meta in recent years.\nWhether the rebranding has worked to detoxify Meta’s corporate image looks debatable given it’s opting to attach Threads to Instagram’s brand, rather than explicitly calling it a Meta app (the developer listed on the App Store is “Instagram Inc” and the text description describes the app as “Instagram’s text-based conversation app”). Albeit that choice might be more to do with Meta seeing it as the best strategy for quickly building up a Threads user-base if it can push Instagram’s large and engaged community to insta-adopt what it’s framing as a sister “text” app so the latter can hit the ground running.\nOne thing is clear: Threads won’t be doing any running in the EU yet. And possibly never. At least not unless Meta radically reforms its approach to user choice over tracking.\nYesterday the Irish Independent reported the app won’t launch in the EU, quoting Meta’s lead regional data protection supervisor, the Irish DPC, saying it had been in contact with Meta about the service and that it wouldn’t launch “at this point”.\nWhile today the Guardian — citing sources inside Meta — has reported the company delayed an EU launch of Threads over legal uncertainty around data use attached to the aforementioned DMA’s limits on sharing user data across different platforms.\nA Meta spokesman did not respond to our questions about whether it plans to launch Threads in the EU or not.\nBut the DPC clarified to TechCrunch that it has not prevented Meta launching Threads, based on its role enforcing compliance with the GDPR, saying the company has “no plans to launch in the EU yet”. So it seems there has not been any active regulatory intervention to block a launch at this stage. Rather Meta appears concerned over the legal risk it could wrack up if it goes ahead with a launch when it’s set to be subject to the DMA in a few months’ time. (Earlier this week the company informed the EU it believes the incoming ex ante antitrust regime does apply to its business — but compliance isn’t required until six months after the official EU gatekeeper designations).\nThe new regulation will be enforced centrally by the European Commission, rather than by Member State level authorities such as the Irish DPC. So expectations are for a change of gear in the bloc towards enforcement on digital giants — and that paradigm shift also cranks up the legal uncertainty for Meta inside the EU.\nNotably Threads is due to launch in the U.K. on Thursday — where there’s a different regulatory picture since the market no longer falls under EU law following the Brexit referendum vote to leave the bloc.\nThe U.K.’s current data protection regime is still derived from the GDPR so, technically speaking, the same legal requirements around processing personal data do also apply there. However the country’s data protection watchdog, the ICO, has been infamously inactive on systemic breaches of the surveillance advertising industry. So Meta may be comfortable with the level of legal risk its business faces in Brexit Britain. And while the U.K. government recently revived a shelved a plan to enact its own ex ante antitrust reform targeted at digital giants, it’s likely years out of having comparable legislation to the EU’s DMA on its own statute books.\nThe U.K. government has also signalled a plan to water down domestic data protection standards, under a post-Brexit data reform bill, which also looks set to erode the independence of the ICO and may make the watchdog even more toothless than it is already when it comes to tackling data protection abuses.\nIn the EU, meanwhile, Meta was fined over $410 million in January over its lack of a valid legal basis under the GDPR to run behavioral ads on Facebook and Instagram — which is just the latest in a string of chunky penalties it’s been hit with for breaching the GDPR. Whereas the last time the ICO fined Meta it was in the wake of the Cambridge Analytics scandal when the company was still called Facebook.\nUnder the DMA, centrally enforced penalties can scale up to 10% of global annual turnover — which is considerably higher than the theoretical maximum DPAs can sanction data controllers for breaches of the GDPR (which tops out at just 4%).\nIn the event, fines on tech giants found to have breached the EU’s data protection regulation have remained a fraction of the maximum, including in the case of Meta.\nAdam Mosseri says Meta’s Threads app won’t have ActivityPub support at launch\nGoogle delays EU launch of its AI chatbot after privacy regulator raises concerns","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to location tracking privacy issues.

The supreme court’s ruling in June ending the constitutional protections for abortion raised potential privacy concerns for women seeking the procedure or related information online.\n“This $391.5m settlement is a historic win for consumers in an era of increasing reliance on technology,” said Connecticut attorney general William Tong in a statement. “Location data is among the most sensitive and valuable personal information Google collects, and there are so many reasons why a consumer may opt-out of tracking.”\nGoogle, based in Mountain View, California, said it fixed the problems several years ago.\n“Consistent with improvements we’ve made in recent years, we have settled this investigation, which was based on outdated product policies that we changed years ago,” said company spokesperson Jose Castaneda in a statement.\nLocation tracking can help tech companies sell digital ads to marketers looking to connect with consumers within their vicinity. It is another tool in a data-gathering toolkit that generates more than $200bn in annual ad revenue for Google, accounting for most of the profits pouring into the coffers of its corporate parent, Alphabet, which has a market value of $1.2tn.\nIn its 2018 story, the AP reported that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones stored users’ location data even if they had used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so. Computer-science researchers at Princeton confirmed these findings at the AP’s request.\nStoring such data carries privacy risks and has been used by police to determine the location of suspects.\nThe AP reported that the privacy issue with location tracking affected about 2 billion users of devices that run Google’s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.\nThe attorneys general who investigated Google said a key part of the company’s digital advertising business was location data, which they called the most sensitive and valuable personal data the company collects.

It also mentions that Google continued to surveil customers and profit from customer data despite representations to the contrary. The lawsuit cites a 2018 Associated Press article that revealed Google continued to track users' locations even when the 'location history' setting was turned off. Google claimed that turning off this setting would stop location tracking, but in reality, there was a separate setting called 'Web & App Activity' that continued to log location and personal data. Additionally, the news highlights that location data is crucial to Google's advertising business, giving the company a financial incentive to dissuade users from withholding access to that data. This information demonstrates that the news is relevant to location tracking privacy issues.\"\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2022\/jan\/24\/google-sued-privacy-texas-district-of-columbia","query_name":"updated_file_Location_tracking_privacy_issues.xlsx"}

{"num":17,"Time":"Updated 7:46 AM EDT, Thu May 6, 2021","Title":"I tracked my kid with Apple’s Airtags to test its privacy features","Content":"New York\nCNN Business\n — \nI clipped a keychain with one of Apple’s tiny new Bluetooth trackers, AirTags, onto my son’s book bag and waved goodbye to him on the school bus. I watched on my iPhone’s Find My app as the bus stopped at a light a few blocks down from our street.\nBut then the tiny “key” icon on the app stopped moving. The item was “last detected” seven minutes ago at a busy intersection less than a mile away. Traffic, maybe? Five more minutes passed with no update. Is there an issue with the app? After another 10 minutes, my heart started to race; still nothing.\nFinally, the tracker was detected four miles away in front of his school. Relieved, I decided more information in this case was worse; I’d go back to just tracking my keys. Apple later told me the delay was due to the tracker needing to communicate with Bluetooth on other iOS devices in the Find My network along the bus route before the AirTag’s location could be updated to iCloud and the app.\nStill, my experiment highlighted how easily these trackers could be used to track another person. After all, I knew the moment he arrived at school and when he got back on the bus to head home.\nEarlier this month, Apple (AAPL) launched $29 Tile-like Bluetooth locators that attach to and help you find items such as keys, wallets, laptops or your car, giving nearly anything a digital footprint. Location trackers aren’t new — there are similar products from Samsung, Sony and Tile — but AirTags’ powerful Ultra Wideband technology chip allows it to more accurately determine the location and enables precise augmented reality directional arrows that populate on the iPhone or iPad’s screen.\nA key ring containing an AirTag attached to a book bag in Sydney, Australia.\nWhile AirTags are explicitly intended for items only, Apple has added safeguards to cut down on unwanted tracking. For example, the company does not store location data, and it will send an alert to an iOS device user if an AirTag appears to be following them when its owner is not around. If the AirTag doesn’t re-tether to the owner’s iOS device after three days, the tracker will start to make a noise.\n“We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag’s privacy and security,” the company said in a statement to CNN Business. “AirTag is designed with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking— a first in the industry— and the Find My network includes a smart, tunable system with deterrents that applies to AirTag, as well as third-party products part of the Find My network accessory program. We are raising the bar on privacy for our users and the industry, and hope others will follow.”\nThe safeguards are a work in progress as the software rolls out and users begin interacting with the devices. When my babysitter recently took my son to an appointment, using my set of keys with an AirTag attached, she was not informed that she was carrying an AirTag — separated from my phone. (She hadn’t yet updated her phone’s software to iOS 14.5.)\nNon-iPhone users can hold their phones close to the AirTags and, via short-range wireless technology, information pops up on how to disable the tracker, but that’s if the person knows they’re being tracked and locates it. In addition, three days is a long time for an AirTag to keep quiet before making a noise.\nApple told CNN Business it may adjust these features through software updates to improve the AirTags’ tracking deterrents. It also said the three-day alert window was determined so as to not inundate users with alerts. For example, if a spouse puts an AirTag on a gym bag and leaves it in a closet while at work, whoever is at home may consider the noise a nuisance.\nDespite the safeguards, some privacy experts and groups are still concerned about unwanted tracking. For example, the National Network to End Domestic Violence — which sits on advisory boards of tech companies including Facebook and Uber — has been vocal about how AirTag and similar devices could be used by an abuser to discreetly monitor someone’s whereabouts.\nApple's new AirTag location trackers\nApple\n“Abusive individuals will misuse any type of technology as a tactic of abuse, regardless of the intended purpose or how helpful it can be to someone else,” Erica Olsen, safety net project director at NNEDV, told CNN Business. “Location tracking is very common and a significant concern for survivors, but this isn’t specific just to AirTags. Apple’s privacy and security notifications can actually make this device harder for abusive people to misuse than others on the market and that point shouldn’t be lost.”\nHowever, she said more work needs to be done to “maximize privacy.”\nAlbert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project and a fellow at the NYU School of Law, agreed, saying AirTag’s safeguards “don’t go far enough.”\nAirTag could give a nice bump to Apple's growing lineup of smaller stuff\n“Three days of tracking is more than long enough to create a privacy risk. For those living with their abusers, they might never find out they’re being tracked if their abusers can frequently come within range of the AirTag,” Cahn said. “Similarly, it is helpful that AirTags will alert nearby iPhones to their presence, but those using Android won’t receive an alert if an AirTag is tracking them.”\nApple said one of the main reasons it spent so much time developing safeguards was the sheer size of its Find My app network. But it’s the AirTags’ reliance on that broader network that creates much of the need for the safeguards in the first place, Cahn said. “That’s because Apple is turning more than a billion iOS devices into a network for tracking AirTags, while Tile will only operate when in range of the small number of people using the Tile app. … The benefits of finding our keys a bit quicker isn’t worth the danger of creating a new global tracking network.”\nAlthough AirTags launched just last week, tech analysts already believe the trackers could be the next big accessory win for Apple. Accessories — from iPhone cases and chargers to tablet keyboards — are a critical part of its revenue growth strategy.\nBut as AirTag adoption grows, Ramon Llamas, a director at research firm IDC, echoed that Apple will need to expand its safeguards, as nefarious parties will “find a way to get around privacy issues one way or another.”\n“This is a work in progress, especially as the use case continues to evolve,” Llamas said. “For now, AirTags is intended for items.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about tracking a child using Apple's AirTags and raises concerns about privacy issues related to location tracking.

That included confusion around “the scope of the Location History setting” and “the extent to which consumers who use Google products and services could limit Google’s location tracking by adjusting their account and device settings,” according to a release from the office of Pennsylvania attorney general and governor-elect Josh Shapiro.\nAs part of the settlement, Google is required to be more transparent, including showing additional information whenever a location-related setting is turned on or off, making key location tracking policies clearly visible and giving users more details on the type of location data being collected and its use. Google will also now face limits on its usage and storage of some location information.\n“Consistent with improvements we’ve made in recent years, we have settled this investigation which was based on outdated product policies that we changed years ago,” Google spokesperson José Castañeda told CNN Business.\nThe attorneys general opened an investigation into Google after a 2018 Associated Press report that the company “records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.” In a statement at the time, Google said it provides “clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.”\nThe search engine faced a similar suit in January when four attorneys general from the District of Columbia, Texas, Indiana and Washington state claimed it had used “dark patterns” and deceptive practices to track users’ physical location even when those users have made efforts to block Google from doing so.\nLocation data like the kind collected by Google can be used to target advertising and build profiles on internet users. Google and other large tech companies have come under renewed scrutiny for their handling of location data in the wake of the overturn of Roe v. Wade.

{"num":13,"Time":"Mon 29 Aug 2022 22.09 CEST","Title":"Data company sued by US government amid fears of sensitive location tracking","Content":"The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday sued Idaho-based data broker Kochava for selling geolocation data from hundreds of millions of mobile devices that could be used to track consumers.\nThe FTC said consumer data could be used to trace people’s movements to and from sensitive locations including “reproductive health clinics, places of worship, homeless and domestic violence shelters, and addiction recovery facilities”.\nHow private is your period-tracking app? Not very, study reveals\nRead more\nThe problem gained interest after a supreme court ruling in June overturned the Roe v Wade decision that guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion. Since then, privacy advocates and the public have called for more limits to the data tech companies collect over concerns that police or other entities could access customers’ search history, geolocation and other information revealing pregnancy plans.\nBut the lawsuit, which seeks to halt Kochava’s sale of sensitive geolocation data and require the company to delete the sensitive geolocation information it has collected, addresses issues beyond tracking those pursuing abortion care. In the suit, FTC alleges the company allows people to customize their data feed to filter for mobile devices at specific times and locations. This would make it easy to track a user over time or try to, for instance, find out where they live.\n“For example, the location of a mobile device at night likely corresponds to the consumer’s home address,” the suit said. “Public or other records may identify the name of the owner or resident of a particular address.”\nIn fact, the company advertises “Household Mapping” as one of the ways to use its data.\nUntil recently, the company also made its data available for purchase by the public and “allowed anyone with little effort to obtain a large sample of sensitive data and use it without restriction”, the FTC alleges. For instance, a sample of Kochava’s data – which included 327,480,000 rows and 11 columns of data, corresponding to more than 61,803,400 unique mobile devices – was available on a trial basis on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace as of June 2022 for anyone to access.\nKochava said the FTC “has a fundamental misunderstanding” of how the data marketplace business works and the company works in compliance with all rules and laws, including those specific to privacy.\n“We hoped to have productive conversations that led to effective solutions with the FTC about these complicated and important issues and are open to them in the future,” said Brian Cox, general manager of Kochava. Unfortunately, the only outcome the FTC desired was a settlement that had no clear terms or resolutions and redefined the problem into a moving target. Real progress to improve data privacy for consumers will not be reached through flamboyant press releases and frivolous litigation.”\n“Where consumers seek out health care, receive counseling, or celebrate their faith is private information that shouldn’t be sold to the highest bidder,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The FTC is taking Kochava to court to protect people’s privacy and halt the sale of their sensitive geolocation information.”\nThe FTC said Kochava buys vast troves of location information from other data brokers across hundreds of millions of mobile devices that is packaged into customized data. They then sell that data to clients including retailers looking at foot traffic.\nThe Kochava data FTC reviewed “included precise, timestamped location data collected from more than 61m unique mobile devices in the previous week”. The FTC lawsuit said Kochava has asserted that it offers “rich geo data spanning billions of devices globally”.\nPrivacy advocates and experts have pushed regulators to address the dangers that the data broker industry poses, particularly to marginalized communities. In Chicago and Colorado, a group of immigrant rights organizations, including Mijente, has fought to expose and close loopholes that the US Customs and Immigration Enforcement Agency (Ice) uses to get around local and state sanctuary policies by buying location and other information from data brokers instead of law enforcement agencies. But the fight against the data broker industry – and tech companies’ general data collection – has garnered mass appeal after the supreme court’s decision.\nIn July, Alphabet’s Google said it would delete location data showing when users visit an abortion clinic, after concerns that a digital trail could inform law enforcement if someone terminates a pregnancy illegally. Earlier this month, the FTC said it is considering writing rules to better protect Americans’ privacy and crack down on businesses that collect far-reaching personal information without consumers’ full understanding.\nCongressional committees have also reached a compromise on the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, which would limit the data broker industry by putting protections around sensitive data like geolocation and by enabling people to demand companies delete data collected on them. However, as Politico reported, the data broker industry has ramped up its lobbying in response to the bill in an effort to soften some of the data-sharing restrictions.\n“This is a great step, but it’s just a first step,” said Albert Fox Cahn, the founder of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “Let’s be clear: it’s not just one abusive vendor, it’s a whole abusive industry. We need to systematically shut down the market for Americans’ location data. No one should have to fear that these shadowy companies will track our most intimate moments and sell them to the highest bidder. And the FTC needs to also target the police departments that misuse this ad data.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Idaho-based data broker Kochava for selling geolocation data from mobile devices, raising concerns about sensitive location tracking.\",\n\"The FTC highlighted that consumer data from Kochava could be used to track individuals, including to and from sensitive locations such as reproductive health clinics, places of worship, homeless shelters, and addiction recovery facilities.\",\n\"The lawsuit seeks to stop Kochava from selling sensitive geolocation data and requires them to delete the collected information.

{"num":21,"Time":"3:19 PM GMT+1•December 14, 2022","Title":"Reports of Musk forcing tracking ads on Twitter put him on a costly collision course with EU privacy laws","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Bryce Durbin \/ TechCrunch\nTwitter’s lead privacy regulator in the European Union is being kept very busy indeed by Elon Musk’s erratic piloting of the bird site.\nFollowing a report by Platformer, which suggests Musk is planning to force users to accept personalized advertising unless they pay for a subscription service that will include an opt-out for ads, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) told us it is reviewing the matter.\nThis adds to a growing pile of data protection concerns piling up on its desk — let’s call these the real ‘Twitter Files’ — such as Musk providing access to Twitter systems to non-staff reporters (um, security and privacy anyone?); the status of Twitter’s main establishment in Ireland (and, therefore, the streamlined situation it currently enjoys with the DPC leading oversight of its compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, aka the GDPR); and whether Twitter has adequate compliance staff and appropriate resources to deal with all the inbound enquiries from regulators and users (such as requests for deletion of data) since Musk took an axe to halve company headcount, to name a small portion of the regulatory chaos he’s kicked up in very short order.\nUnder the GDPR Twitter needs a valid legal basis to process personal data, such as tracking and profiling users to target them with ads.\nConsent is one of the legal bases that can be possible under the GDPR — but you can’t force users to consent; consent must be freely given if it’s to meet the legal bar. Ergo, forcing users to pay up or else be tracked and targeted looks unlikely to pass muster with EU regulators.\nAnother legal bases permitted in the GDPR is contractual necessity. And it’s worth noting that this is the legal basis currently claimed by Facebook-owner Meta for the ‘personalized’ ads it forces on users of its social networking services.\nHowever in a blow to Musk’s ambitions to follow Zuck and force microtargeted ads into Europeans eyeballs whether they like it or not (or else, in Musk’s case, force Europeans to pay him not to profile them for ad targeting), the European Data Protection Board recently issued a decision on a long running complaint against Meta’s controversial choice of legal basis — which, per press reports, appears to rule out using a claim of performance of a contract to run behavioral advertising.\nThere is also legitimate interest (LI) — another legal basis that exists in the GDPR. But, again, it’s a sad trombone for Musk on this front as TikTok was forced to abort a planned switch of legal basis for its personalized ads, from consent to LI, this summer — after warnings from Italy’s DPA that this would not be legit.\nThe DPC also stepped in to ‘engage’ with TikTok on the matter — in its capacity as TikTok’s lead supervisor for GDPR. But it’s not just the GDPR that’s likely to apply here if Twitter similarly tries to force tracking ads on users in Europe: The EU’s ePrivacy Directive, which governs online tracking, also likely comes into play — and, as Italy’s DPA warned TikTok a few months ago, you can’t do tracking without asking for consent. Ergo LI won’t fly for Twitter tracking ads.\nAdditionally, and unhappily for Musk — who is famously not a fan of regulators — the ePrivacy Directive does not have a one-stop-shop mechanism streamlining regulatory oversight (and oftentimes shrinking risk) via a lead DPA, as is the case with the GDPR. So if he tries to force tracking ads on EU users he’s opening the company up to enforcement by privacy watchdogs across the bloc, from Italy to France, and on through as many of the 27 EU Member States that have DPAs with an appetite for enforcement.\nFrance’s privacy watchdog, the CNIL, has been very active on enforcing ePrivacy against tech giants in recent years — fining Google $120 million two years ago for dropping tracking cookies without consent, for instance, and hitting the adtech giant a second time with a further $170 million penalty this January over cookie consent dark patterns. It has also spanked Amazon and Facebook with multimillion dollar penalties for ePrivacy breaches over the same time frame. So there’s little reason to think the French would turn a blind eye to a swashbuckling Muskian forced-tracking-ads adventure.\nIt’s worth noting there are examples in some EU Member States (notably Germany) of certain news media websites putting up paywalls that offer users a choice between subscribing to view their content (i.e. journalism) or getting free access to it but with the stipulation that they agree to be tracked as the ‘price’ for this freebie.\nTheir approach remains controversial with data protection law experts and may not survive legal challenges. But, in the meanwhile, it doesn’t necessarily offer much succour to Musk’s ambitions to force ads on unwilling Europeans, either, since there is a clear difference between pay-or-be-tracked-gating of journalism (i.e. profession content that the paywalling company is paying to produce) vs pay-or-be-tracked-gating of user generated content which Musk is getting for free for some crazy reason, even as he yells at Twitter users to pay him ~$8pm or else.\nSo a pay-me-or-else paywall in the microblogging platform case doesn’t look like it would be smooth sailing either.\nA really key difference is that news media are asking you to pay for content they have produced at a cost. Funding good journalism is important. EM is flapping around trying to monetise content and engagement created by others.\n— Daragh O Brien mastodon.ie\/@CastlebridgeChief (@CBridge_Chief) December 14, 2022\nSo what penalties might Musk face if he goes ahead and tries to force ads on European users?\nUnder the GDPR, penalties can scale up to 4% of global annual turnover — so, on paper, the cost of breaking the law can certainly get expensive (though Twitter has escaped major sanction to date). But GDPR penalties against tech giants have been getting bigger in recent years (even if the bill may take years to arrive). And flagrant\/wilful breaches typically invite bigger fines than one-off incidents like a security slip up.\nePrivacy also allows EU regulators to levy dissuasive sanctions for breaches — and these can, demonstrably, exceed a hundred million dollars apiece (i.e. from a single regulator), so costs could stack up quickly here too if multiple watchdogs wade in.\nePrivacy enforcement is also not slowed down by a one-stop-shop mechanism funnelling cross-border complaints through a single lead regulator (as happens with the GDPR). So fines could arrive in fairly short order if Musk pushes ahead with forced tracking despite the lack of a legal path for such processing.\nBoth privacy laws also enable EU regulators to issue corrective orders against infringing practices. And failure to comply with such orders invites — you guessed it! — further sanction. So if Musk refuses to correct course he is walking into an ongoing world of costly regulatory pain in Europe.\nHe has more regulatory trouble brewing in the region, too.\nLooming on the horizon is application of the EU’s new Digital Services Act (DSA), the bloc’s rebooted Internet rulebook, which concerns itself with content governance issues, so how platforms tackle problems like terrorism, hate speech, disinformation etc. Here again Musk’s ‘free the bird’ approach has quickly thrown regulatory expectations into a spin that has led (already) to closer scrutiny by EU lawmakers than would likely have occurred without the Tesla CEO at the helm of Twitter.\nThe European Commission itself will oversee larger platforms’ compliance with the DSA, rather than national authorities. And just last month it warned Twitter over the need to have adequate resourcing for compliance in place — saying it would carry out a stress test of its approach at its Dublin HQ early next year. So it’s already putting Twitter on DSA watch.\nIt remains to be seen whether or not the Commission will classify Twitter as a so-called VLOP — meaning it would take on the burden of regulating Musk’s erratic rule itself. But he is essentially inviting that increased level of EU scrutiny (and regulatory risk) by playing so fast and loose with existing governance and compliance structures. Ergo, Twitter’s DSA compliance being regulated by the Commission looks rather more possible than it probably should, based on an assessment of the platform’s size alone. And that’s all down to Musk’s hard work ripping up existing governance structures and driving out compliance expertise.\nPenalties under the DSA can scale up to 6% of global annual turnover. The regulation also contains powers for regulators to ban infringing services if they repeatedly fail to correct governance — so if Musk keeps on trolling the region’s regulators a complete loss of Twitter’s EU revenue cannot be entirely ruled out… Buckle up!","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to location tracking privacy issues because it discusses Elon Musk's plan to force Twitter users to accept personalized advertising unless they pay for a subscription service that includes an opt-out for ads.

{"num":20,"Time":"11:50 PM GMT+2•May 5, 2020","Title":"A security expert says India’s contact-tracing app has flaws; New Delhi says they are ‘by design’","Content":"cameraImage Credits:\nThe Indian government has said that its contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu “by design” fetches the location data of its 90 million users and allows them to view the concentration of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus in their vicinity.\nNew Delhi issued the statement after France-based security researcher Baptiste Robert found what he argues are design flaws and privacy issues.\nThe government said it has always disclosed that it fetches users’ location data, a feature that critics say falls short of the privacy protections offered by similar technologies, including the joint project run by Apple and Google.\nAarogya Setu’s privacy policy says the app — in addition to collecting location data of a user at the time of registration — also “continuously collects your location data and stores securely on your mobile device a record of all the places you have been at 15-minute intervals.” The app uploads this data to its server along with the user’s digital ID if they test positive for COVID-19, or self-declare seeing symptoms that indicate that they might be infected with the infectious disease, it says.\nCollecting location data is a complicated subject, regardless of the good intention of its developers and operators. On Monday, Google and Apple banned the use of location tracking on their coronavirus-tracing technology.\nWhile some developers have argued that they need access to location data to track how outbreaks move and identify hotspots, privacy advocates have cautioned that if this data ever gets exposed, it could ostracize those who are affected.\nRobert’s other concern is that Aarogya Setu, which was launched early last month, allows anyone to view the concentration of people in 500 meters to up to 10 kilometers who are either suspicious they have coronavirus, or are certain that they have the disease. He told TechCrunch that he was able to develop a script and view similar data for any nook and cranny of the world’s second most populous nation.\nHe said the government, which introduced a nationwide lockdown in late March, could have kept the radius limited to 500 meters.\nIn response, New Delhi said that its system is designed in a way that would prevent any script from making bulk requests. Additionally, it said, “getting data for multiple latitude and longitude this way is no different from asking several people of their location’s COVID-19 statistics.”\n“All this information is already public for all locations and hence does not compromise on any personal or sensitive data,” the response said.\nSome people argued today that at a crisis like this, when thousands of people are dying, these “flaws” were the least of their concerns and that the app served a much greater purpose. But Aarogya Setu, which has amassed 90 million monthly active people in less than 35 days, has also ruffled some feathers for the way it is being scaled up. New Delhi said earlier this month that all government and private sector employees need to have this app installed on their smartphones.\nOn Tuesday, local authority in Noida city, home to more than 640,000 people, on the outskirts of Delhi, said those who did not have the Aarogya Setu app installed on their phone would be fined or sent to prison.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The news is relevant to location tracking privacy issues because it discusses the concerns and privacy implications surrounding the Indian government's contact-tracing app, Aarogya Setu.\",\n\"The app is designed to fetch the location data of its 90 million users, which raises privacy concerns.\",\n\"A security researcher, Baptiste Robert, identified design flaws and privacy issues in the app.\",\n\"Aarogya Setu continuously collects users' location data and stores it on their mobile devices at 15-minute intervals.\",\n\"The app uploads this data to its server if users test positive for COVID-19 or display symptoms, potentially compromising user privacy.\",\n\"The news mentions the debate over the need for location data to track COVID-19 outbreaks versus privacy concerns.\",\n\"The app allows anyone to view the concentration of people in a certain radius who are suspected of having COVID-19, which could be seen as a privacy invasion.\",\n\"There is a discussion about the government's response to these concerns, including the claim that the system is designed to prevent bulk data requests and that the information is already public, thus not compromising personal or sensitive data.\",\n\"The news also mentions mandatory installation of the app for government and private sector employees and the potential penalties for not having it installed on one's phone.\"\n]\n}","From":"techcrunch.com","Url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/05\/aarogya-setu-app-security-privacy-concerns-india-response\/","query_name":"updated_file_Location_tracking_privacy_issues.xlsx"}

The records included passengers’ full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and the location where they had signed up.\nDrivers were also affected, with 3.7 million, including 82,000 from the UK, having their weekly pay, trip summaries and, in a small number of cases, driver’s licence numbers accessed.\nUber challenges ruling on drivers' rights at court of appeal\nRead more\nThe ICO said the breach was caused by inadequate information security, and was compounded by Uber US’s decision to not disclose the attack, instead complying with the hackers’ demands to pay $100,000 as a “bug bounty”. Such bounties are common in the security world, with companies offering rewards to researchers who find and notify them of system weaknesses before they can be attacked.\nHowever, the ICO wrote: “Uber US did not follow the normal operation of its bug bounty programme. In this incident Uber US paid outside attackers who were fundamentally different from legitimate bug bounty recipients: instead of merely identifying a vulnerability and disclosing it responsibly, they maliciously exploited the vulnerability and intentionally acquired personal information relating to Uber users.”\nIt said none of the people whose personal data had been compromised were notified of the breach. Instead, the company only began monitoring accounts for fraud 12 months after the attack.\nHowever, the potential penalty was mitigated by the fact that Uber’s European branches were also not informed of the breach, meaning the company was not able to report it to the commissioner; and by the lack of evidence that the compromised data was misused.\nUber US was ordered in September to pay $148m for failing to notify drivers about the breach.\nIn a statement, Uber said “We’re pleased to close this chapter on the data incident from 2016. As we shared with European authorities during their investigations, we’ve made a number of technical improvements to the security of our systems both in the immediate wake of the incident as well as in the years since.\n“We’ve also made significant changes in leadership to ensure proper transparency with regulators and customers moving forward. Earlier this year we hired our first chief privacy officer, data protection officer, and a new chief trust and security officer. We learn from our mistakes and continue our commitment to earn the trust of our users every day.”\nThe timing of the breach meant the fine was issued under the old Data Protection Act 1998, which sets out a maximum financial penalty of £500,000. Under the DPA 2018, which brings the EU’s general data protection regulation into British law, the potential fine would be much higher, at up to 4% of Uber’s global revenue.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to a data breach, but it is not specifically about a Navigation system data leak.

The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) concluded that Facebook failed to safeguard its users’ information and that it failed to be transparent about how that data was harvested by others.\nRevealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach\nRead more\n“Facebook has failed to provide the kind of protections they are required to under the Data Protection Act,” said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. “Fines and prosecutions punish the bad actors, but my real goal is to effect change and restore trust and confidence in our democratic system.”\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Facebook took £500,000 in revenue every five and a half minutes. Because of the timing of the breaches, the ICO said it was unable to levy the penalties introduced by the European General Data Protection (GDPR), which caps fines at the higher level of €20m (£17m) or 4% of global turnover – in Facebook’s case, $1.9bn (£1.4bn). The £500,000 cap was set by the Data Protection Act 1998.\nOn Wednesday, Denham said: “This was a very serious contravention, so in the new regime they would face a much higher fine.”\nAsked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if the fine now would amount to hundreds of millions of pounds, she said it “could”.\nDenham added: “This is not all about fines though … any company is worried about its reputation, because people want to feel that their data is safe.\n“In 2014 and 2015, the Facebook platform allowed an app … that ended up harvesting 87m profiles of users around the world that was then used by Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 presidential campaign and in the referendum.”\nFacebook’s chief privacy Officer, Erin Egan, said of the intent to fine: “As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015. We have been working closely with the ICO in their investigation of Cambridge Analytica, just as we have with authorities in the US and other countries. We’re reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon.”\nThe inquiry, described by Denham as “the most important investigation that the ICO has ever undertaken”, has also resulted in warning letters being sent to 11 political parties – every UK party with an MP in the House of Commons as of March 2017, when the investigation began – and notices compelling them to agree to data protection audits.\nIt has led to a criminal prosecution of SCL Elections, Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, for failing to properly deal with the ICO’s enforcement notice, and an enforcement notice against the same for not replying to a subject access request from an American whose data it held.\n00:13:04\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video\nSCL Elections declared bankruptcy in May, two months after the Observer reported that 50m Facebook profiles had been obtained. Denham said the ICO was examining whether the company’s directors could be still be pursued now that SCL Elections had been placed into administration.\nThe investigation also found that Aggregate IQ, a Canadian electoral services company, had “significant links” to Cambridge Analytica, Denham said, and “may still retain” data about UK voters; the ICO has filed an enforcement notice against the company to stop processing that data.\nQuick Guide\nHow the Cambridge Analytica story unfolded\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Most of us have some understanding of the behavioural targeting that commercial entities have used for quite some time,” Denham said, “to sell us holidays, to sell us trainers, to be able to target us and follow us around the web.”\n“But very few people have an awareness of how they can be micro-targeted, persuaded or nudged in a democratic campaign, in an election or a referendum.\n“This is a time when people are sitting up and saying ‘we need a pause here, and we need to be sure we are comfortable with the way personal data is used in our democratic process’.”\nFacebook among 30 organisations in UK political data inquiry\nRead more\nThe ICO had concerns about a number of aspects of political campaigning more broadly. It found that some un-named political parties were using software that could predict the ethnicity of voters, for instance, and found others acquiring data from problematic sources.\nIn response to the ICO’s report Damian Collins, chair of a parliamentary committee investigating online disinformation, said it was essential that the public know whether other organisations harvested data from Facebook.\n“This cannot by left to a secret internal investigation at Facebook,” Collins said. “If other developers broke the law we have a right to know, and the users whose data may have been compromised in this way should be informed.”\nAs part of its investigation, the ICO also issued a notice of intent to take regulatory action against Lifecycle Marketing (Mother & Baby) Limited, a data broker that provides information to new mothers and the trading name of the website Emma’s Diary, which was used by the Labour party.\nIts financial accounts describe its principle activity as “the marketing of brands and products to prenatal and postnatal mothers via channels providing multiple touchpoints for the provision of information and guidance to new mothers.”\nWhat triggered the ICO's political data inquiry?\nRead more\n“We were significantly concerned around the nature of the data that the political parties had access to,” said Steve Wood, the deputy information commissioner, “and we followed the trail to look at the different data brokers who were supplying the political parties.\n“Emma’s Diary is one of the first ones, as part of that investigation, which has come to fruition. We found there were really significant concerns about how Emma’s Diary was gathering the data, particularly involving mothers who were in hospital. We particularly looked at breaches of principle one of the Data Protection Act, covering the lack of transparency and consent from the individuals, in this context, the mothers, and then how that data was subsequently used by the political parties in their profiling, analytics and targeting.\nEmma’s Diary says it works in a “long-term partnership” with the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Midwives. In 2016 it made a profit of £1.5m on a turnover of £7.5m.\nThe company said: “Following the release of the ICO notice of intent against Lifecycle Marketing we do not agree with the initial findings and will be responding to them accordingly. For over 25 years we have operated with integrity and within the spirit of data regulations.

{"num":4,"Time":"Sat 17 Mar 2018 23.03 CET","Title":"Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach","Content":"The data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump’s election team and the winning Brexit campaign harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.\nA whistleblower has revealed to the Observer how Cambridge Analytica – a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon – used personal information taken without authorisation in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements.\nChristopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”\nDocuments seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.\nProfile\nCambridge Analytica: the key players\nShow\n\n\n\nThe New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.\nThe data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.\nHowever, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.\nCambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.\n“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”\nOn Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.\nKey Trump adviser Steve Bannon Photograph: Alain Robert\/Sipa\/Rex\/Shutterstock\nThe revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.\nThe Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.\nLast month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.\nSimon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”\nCambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”\nWylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.\nAt the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.\nThe evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.\nThat legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.\n“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.\nFacebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.\n“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”\nPaul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.\n“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”\nWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons\nChristopher Wylie\nA majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.\nFacebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.\nFacebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.\nKogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.\nQuick Guide\nHow the Cambridge Analytica story unfolded\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.\nThe algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.\n“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.\nAt the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”\nCambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.\nGSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.\nSCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.\nSteve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.\nThe Observer\nThe Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

Although none of the devices have internet connectivity and won’t be found on exposed device database sites like Shodan, they still can be remotely accessed and controlled by SMS.\nResearchers at U.K. cybersecurity firm Fidus Information Security say the device can be tricked into turning over its real-time location simply by anyone sending it a text message with a keyword. Through another command, anyone can call the device and remotely listen in to its in-built microphone without alerting anyone.\nAnother command can remotely kill the cell signal altogether, rendering the device effectively useless.\nAlthough the device can be protected with a PIN, it’s not enabled by default. Worse, the researchers found the device can be remotely reset without needing a PIN — opening up the device to further commands.\n“This device is marketed at keeping the most vulnerable safe and yet anybody can locate and listen into thousands of people’s lives without their knowledge,” said Fidus’ Andrew Mabbitt, who wrote up the team’s findings. “This day and age, everything is connected one way or another and we seem to be leaving security behind; this isn’t going to end well.”\nAn attacker only requires the phone number of the device, Mabbitt told TechCrunch. His team showed it was easy to extrapolate hundreds of working phone numbers connected to vulnerable devices based off a single known device. “We made the assumption that these numbers were purchased in a batch,” said the team’s write-up.\nThe team bought a device and allowed TechCrunch to verify their findings. With a single command, we got a text message back in seconds with the precise co-ordinates of its location. We could also pull other information from the device, including its IMEI number and battery level.\nThe phone call trick, which Mabbitt called a “glorified wiretap,” also worked.\nOne text message to a vulnerable device, bought by the security researchers, allowed us to remotely grab its real-time coordinates. The geolocation was precise to a few meters. (Image: TechCrunch)\nThere are an estimated 10,000 devices in the U.K. — and thousands more around the world. The team told several of the device makers of the flaws, but Mabbitt said there’s no way to fix the vulnerabilities without recalling every device.\nPebbell said in an email after publication that its devices were not vulnerable. None of the remaining device sellers we contacted responded to a request for comment.\n“Fixing this broken security would be trivial,” said the team. “All they needed to do was print a unique code on each pendant and require that to be used to change configurations. The location and call functions could be locked down to calls and texts only from those numbers previously programmed in as emergency contacts.”\nThe U.K. just last week announced a proposed new cybersecurity law that would require connected devices to be sold with a unique password, and not a default.\nUpdated Thursday with remarks from Pebbell.\nRead more:\nAn unsecured SMS spam operation doxxed its owners\nSamsung spilled SmartThings app source code and secret keys\nSecurity lapse exposed a Chinese smart city surveillance system\nA leaky database of SMS text messages exposed password resets and two-factor codes\nChipotle customers are saying their accounts have been hacked\nWe found a massive spam operation — and sunk its server\nDow Jones’ watchlist of 2.4 million high-risk individuals has leaked\nRobocaller firm Stratics Networks exposed millions of call recordings\nMassive mortgage and loan data leak gets worse as original documents also exposed\nComments are disabled for this article.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about a popular GPS tracker containing security flaws that leak real-time locations and can remotely activate its microphone.

The watchdog said it was imposing an “immediate temporary limitation on the processing of Italian users’ data” by ChatGPT’s owner, the San Francisco-based OpenAI.\nOpenAI said on Friday it had disabled ChatGPT in Italy and that it complies with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n“We are committed to protecting people’s privacy and we believe we comply with GDPR and other privacy laws,” said an OpenAI spokesperson, who added that the company limits the use of personal data in systems such as ChatGPT.\n“We actively work to reduce personal data in training our AI systems like ChatGPT because we want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.”\nChatGPT has been a sensation since its launch last November due to its ability to generate plausible-sounding responses to questions, as well as creating an array of content including poems, academic essays and summaries of lengthy documents when prompted by users.\nIt is powered by a groundbreaking artificial intelligence system that is trained on a vast amount of information culled from the internet.\nThe Italian watchdog cited concerns about how the chatbot processed information in its statement.\nIt referred to “the lack of a notice to users and to all those involved whose data is gathered by OpenAI” and said there appears to be “no legal basis underpinning the massive collection and processing of personal data in order to ‘train’ the algorithms on which the platform relies”.\nThe ban came days after more than 1,000 artificial intelligence experts, researchers and backers – including the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk – called for an immediate pause in the creation of “giant” AIs for at least six months amid concerns that companies such as OpenAI are creating “ever more powerful digital minds that no one … can understand, predict, or reliably control”.\nThe Italian watchdog also referred to a data breach suffered by OpenAI on 20 March, which partly exposed conversations and some users’ personal details including email addresses and the last four digits of their credit cards.\nThe regulator said ChatGPT faced a loss of data “regarding the conversations of users and information related to the payment of the subscribers for the service”. At the time OpenAI apologised and said it would “work diligently to rebuild trust”.\nSign up to TechScape\nFree weekly newsletter\nAlex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

OpenAI has been contacted for comment.\nOpenAI, which developed ChatGPT, did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday.\nThe move is unlikely to affect applications from companies that already have licences with OpenAI to use the same technology driving the chatbot, such as Microsoft’s Bing search engine.\nThe CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, announced this week that he is embarking on a six-continent trip in May to talk about the technology with users and developers.\nThat will include a stop planned for Brussels, where European Union lawmakers have been negotiating sweeping new rules to limit high-risk AI tools.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is about a data breach concerning ChatGPT, which is a relevant topic for Navigation system data leaks.

Users have been warned to be wary of \"phishing\" emails pretending to be updates or security information, and to urgently change the passwords on any sites or services that use the same password as their PSN username.\nThe firm conducted a \"forensic security\" examination and discovered a hacker, or hackers, had accessed the internal corporate computer systems that hold the details. The UK's information commissioner said he would ask Sony to explain the circumstances of the data leak, which might constitute a breach of the Data Protection Act.\nThe details of the users of the worldwide PlayStation Network – used by owners of Sony Playstation 3s and PlayStation Portables – include names, addresses, dates of birth, email addresses, and passwords to the network. They are a treasure trove potentially worth more than £100m to those who have stolen them if sold through online black markets, where the data required for an individual identity theft can cost up to $10, and a million unverified email addresses cost just $8.\nSony confirmed late on Tuesday that it had suffered an \"intrusion\" into its system on Wednesday 20 April, and that it had shut down the PSN and its Qriocity music streaming services as soon as the incident was discovered.\nThe PSN system was still down late on Wednesday. As well as costing Sony money the closure will be affecting a new generation of games companies that had hoped to use the system as a new means of selling games solely through downloads.\nThe admission will be a huge blow to Sony, which has been struggling to regain its once iconic status after years of missteps, and will increase pressure on its chief executive, Sir Howard Stringer.\nSony has not said how the hackers broke in. But Rik Ferguson, a computer security consultant at Trend Micro, said: \"This has all the hallmarks of commercial criminal activity going for a saleable commodity. It doesn't look as though they would have broken in directly through the PlayStation Network. Far more likely is that they breached the corporate systems and then moved through them to access this valuable data.\"\nThe breach is one of the biggest ever, and in terms of the value of the data contained may be the most valuable to the hackers. In January 2009 a US payment card processor, Heartland Payment Systems, was hacked, affecting up to 100m cards; in March 2007 the systems of the store chain TK Maxx were hacked, leading to the theft of 46m credit card details.\nHowever the PSN break-in is potentially more valuable because of the quality and breadth of data involved, as it could be used to construct an entire identity.\nSecurity experts are wondering whether Microsoft's rival XBox Live service, which provides a similar function to Sony's PSN, could be targeted, though experts said it was a more closed system.\nDave Whitelegg, a data security blogger, said: \"Microsoft's approach to [running a gaming network] is a bit more guarded than Sony's. The PSN is a much more open system. It's a whole different philosophy. A classic example is, on Xbox Live you do not get a web browser – the reason for that is security; it's a possible attack vector and could get you into their network. But the PlayStation 3 has one.\"\nFerguson said highly targeted commercial hacking attacks had increased recently, with large online repositories of information being targeted. The activism group Anonymous took the unusual step of insisting it was not behind the breach. It had previously attacked Sony over the company's legal complaints about gamers who tried to hack software that would let PS3s play any game.\n\"For once we didn't do it,\" the organisation, which describes itself as fighting for internet freedom, wrote on its blog. \"AnonOps was not related to this incident and does not take responsibility for whatever has happened.\"\nSony has been criticised for the fact that the hackers have apparently been able to copy the data directly, implying it was not encrypted.\nAlmost every commercial site scrambles a user's password before storing it; when the user tries to log in, the password they provide is scrambled in the same way and then compared with the stored one, meaning the \"plaintext\" password is not available. It does not appear that Sony has done this.\nIan Shepherd, chief executive of video-games retailer Game Group, told Reuters: \"The issue, the experience that Sony are having … is a really serious one. It's one we're staying very close to. I think there are lessons for the whole industry from the experience that Sony are having.\"\nMany gamers expressed anger. On the PS3news.com online forum, PSN member Jarvis wrote: \"Stop purchasing anything remotely related to Sony. Let companies who deal with Sony know that you can't support them if they continue to work with Sony.\"\nBut Ferguson said such threats were unlikely to amount to anything. \"That's just frustration. There would be a real hardware cost in doing that. In fact, it's likely to be more like what happens after a terrorist attack: security is stepped up and everyone is much safer for some time afterwards.\"\nSince Stinger's appointment in March 2005 he has struggled to break the company out of its \"silo\" organisation that has prevented co-ordination between different divisions.\nBut revenue and profits have both remained flat, while the company has struggled to make an impact in new areas. The PlayStation 3, launched in 2006 in Japan and 2007 elsewhere, is widely seen as third-placed behind Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's Wii, and has dragged down profits.\nA series of other problems such as battery fires and spyware embedded on music CDs have not helped its reputation either, and Stringer is now widely seen as being vulnerable if the company's performance does not improve.\nMeanwhile the first lawsuit resulting from the security breach has been filed.\nIt was filed on behalf of Kristopher Johns, 36, of Alabama. Johns accuses Sony of not taking \"reasonable care to protect, encrypt, and secure the private and sensitive data of its users.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to a data leak, but it is not related to a Navigation system data leak.

Biostar 2 uses fingerprints and facial recognition as part of its means of identifying people attempting to gain access to buildings.\nLast month, Suprema announced its Biostar 2 platform was integrated into another access control system – AEOS. AEOS is used by 5,700 organisations in 83 countries, including governments, banks and the UK Metropolitan police.\nThe Great Hack: the film that goes behind the scenes of the Facebook data scandal\nRead more\nThe Israeli security researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar working with vpnmentor, a service that reviews virtual private network services, have been running a side project to scans ports looking for familiar IP blocks, and then use these blocks to find holes in companies’ systems that could potentially lead to data breaches.\nIn a search last week, the researchers found Biostar 2’s database was unprotected and mostly unencrypted. They were able to search the database by manipulating the URL search criteria in Elasticsearch to gain access to data.\nThe researchers had access to over 27.8m records, and 23 gigabytes-worth of data including admin panels, dashboards, fingerprint data, facial recognition data, face photos of users, unencrypted usernames and passwords, logs of facility access, security levels and clearance, and personal details of staff.\nMuch of the usernames and passwords were not encrypted, Rotem told the Guardian.\n“We were able to find plain-text passwords of administrator accounts,” he said.\n“The access allows first of all seeing millions of users are using this system to access different locations and see in real time which user enters which facility or which room in each facility, even.”\n“We [were] able to change data and add new users,” he said.\nThis would mean that he could edit an existing user’s account and add his own fingerprint and then be able to access whatever building that user is authorised to access, or he could just add himself as a user with his photo and fingerprints.\nIn the paper about the discovery provided to the Guardian before being published by vpnmentor on Wednesday, the researchers said they were able to access data from co-working organisations in the US and Indonesia, a gym chain in India and Sri Lanka, a medicine supplier in the United Kingdom, and a car parking space developer in Finland, among others.\nThe researchers said the sheer scale of the breach was alarming because the service is in 1.5m locations across the world and because, unlike passwords being leaked, when fingerprints are leaked, you can’t change your fingerprint.\n“Instead of saving a hash of the fingerprint (that can’t be reverse-engineered) they are saving people’s actual fingerprints that can be copied for malicious purposes,” the researchers said in the paper.\nThe researchers made multiple attempts to contact Suprema before taking the paper to the Guardian late last week. Early Wednesday morning (Australian time) the vulnerability was closed, but they still have not heard back from the security firm.\nChinese cyberhackers 'blurring line between state power and crime'\nRead more\nSuprema’s head of marketing, Andy Ahn, told the Guardian the company had taken an “in-depth evaluation” of the information provided by vpnmentor and would inform customers if there was a threat.\n“If there has been any definite threat on our products and\/or services, we will take immediate actions and make appropriate announcements to protect our customers’ valuable businesses and assets,” Ahn said.\nRotem said the problem wasn’t unique to Suprema.\n“It’s very common. There’s literally millions of open systems, and going through them is a very tedious process,” he said. “And some of the systems are quite sensitive.”\nHe said supply chain vulnerabilities – where a company uses a third-party company for a service that doesn’t have appropriate security – was common but often some of the vulnerabilities discovered were with Fortune 500 companies.\nRotem said he contacts around three or four companies per week with similar issues. Earlier this year, Rotem pointed out a substantial flaw in Amadeus’s flight booking system.\n“Mistakes happen, and the real test is how you handle them,” Rotem said. “If you have a security team that can respond quickly and efficiently it’s good enough. If you have a security team that will send a legal team to threaten you, well, it’s less efficient.\n“And this happens quite a lot. It’s unpleasant for someone to point out you have a vulnerability or weakness.

On the contrary, he was pursuing a personal vendetta, seeking revenge for the disciplinary proceedings a month earlier.\n“In these circumstances, applying the established approach to cases of this kind, his employer is not vicariously liable.”\nA statement issued by Morrisons after the ruling said: “The theft of data happened because a single employee with legitimate authority to hold the data also held a secret and wholly unreasonable grudge against Morrisons and wanted to hurt the company and our colleagues.\n“We are pleased that the supreme court has agreed that Morrisons should not be held vicariously liable for his actions when he was acting alone, to his own criminal plan and he’s been found guilty of this crime and spent time in jail.\n“A court has already found that Morrisons was not responsible for any direct wrongdoing in respect of this data theft.”\nIn July 2015, Skelton was found guilty at Bradford crown court of fraud, securing unauthorised access to computer material and disclosing personal data, and was jailed for eight years.\nNick McAleenan, a partner and data rights specialist lawyer for JMW Solicitors, who represented the group of 9,000 claimants in the landmark class action against Morrisons, said: “My clients entrusted their personal information to their employer, Morrisons, in good faith.\n“When their information was subsequently uploaded to the internet by a fellow employee, it caused an enormous amount of upset and distress to tens of thousands of people.\n“The supreme court’s decision now places my clients, the backbone of Morrisons’ business, in the position of having no legal avenue remaining to challenge what happened to them.\n“My clients are of course hugely disappointed by the decision, which contradicts two earlier unanimous findings in their favour.”\nThe decision overturns previous rulings in the high court and court of appeal, which held that Morrisons was vicariously liable for Skelton’s actions.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to the topic of data leak, specifically the leak of staff payroll data.

{"num":13,"Time":"Tue 26 Sep 2017 08.10 CEST","Title":"I asked Tinder for my data. It sent me 800 pages of my deepest, darkest secrets","Content":"A\nt 9.24pm (and one second) on the night of Wednesday 18 December 2013, from the second arrondissement of Paris, I wrote “Hello!” to my first ever Tinder match. Since that day I’ve fired up the app 920 times and matched with 870 different people. I recall a few of them very well: the ones who either became lovers, friends or terrible first dates. I’ve forgotten all the others. But Tinder has not.\nThe dating app has 800 pages of information on me, and probably on you too if you are also one of its 50 million users. In March I asked Tinder to grant me access to my personal data. Every European citizen is allowed to do so under EU data protection law, yet very few actually do, according to Tinder.\nWith the help of privacy activist Paul-Olivier Dehaye from personaldata.io and human rights lawyer Ravi Naik, I emailed Tinder requesting my personal data and got back way more than I bargained for.Some 800 pages came back containing information such as my Facebook “likes”, links to where my Instagram photos would have been had I not previously deleted the associated account, my education, the age-rank of men I was interested in, how many Facebook friends I had, when and where every online conversation with every single one of my matches happened … the list goes on.\n“I am horrified but absolutely not surprised by this amount of data,” said Olivier Keyes, a data scientist at the University of Washington. “Every app you use regularly on your phone owns the same [kinds of information]. Facebook has thousands of pages about you!”\nAs I flicked through page after page of my data I felt guilty. I was amazed by how much information I was voluntarily disclosing: from locations, interests and jobs, to pictures, music tastes and what I liked to eat. But I quickly realised I wasn’t the only one. A July 2017 study revealed Tinder users are excessively willing to disclose information without realising it.\n“You are lured into giving away all this information,” says Luke Stark, a digital technology sociologist at Dartmouth University. “Apps such as Tinder are taking advantage of a simple emotional phenomenon; we can’t feel data. This is why seeing everything printed strikes you. We are physical creatures. We need materiality.”\nReading through the 1,700 Tinder messages I’ve sent since 2013, I took a trip into my hopes, fears, sexual preferences and deepest secrets. Tinder knows me so well. It knows the real, inglorious version of me who copy-pasted the same joke to match 567, 568, and 569; who exchanged compulsively with 16 different people simultaneously one New Year’s Day, and then ghosted 16 of them.\n“What you are describing is called secondary implicit disclosed information,” explains Alessandro Acquisti, professor of information technology at Carnegie Mellon University. “Tinder knows much more about you when studying your behaviour on the app. It knows how often you connect and at which times; the percentage of white men, black men, Asian men you have matched; which kinds of people are interested in you; which words you use the most; how much time people spend on your picture before swiping you, and so on. Personal data is the fuel of the economy. Consumers’ data is being traded and transacted for the purpose of advertising.”\nTinder’s privacy policy clearly states your data may be used to deliver “targeted advertising”.\nAll that data, ripe for the picking\nTinder: ‘You should not expect that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure.’ Photograph: Alamy\nWhat will happen if this treasure trove of data gets hacked, is made public or simply bought by another company? I can almost feel the shame I would experience. The thought that, before sending me these 800 pages, someone at Tinder might have read them already makes me cringe. Tinder’s privacy policy clearly states: “you should not expect that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure”. As a few minutes with a perfectly clear tutorial on GitHub called Tinder Scraper that can “collect information on users in order to draw insights that may serve the public” shows, Tinder is only being honest.\nIn May, an algorithm was used to scrape 40,000 profile images from the platform in order to build an AI to “genderise” faces. A few months earlier, 70,000 profiles from OkCupid (owned by Tinder’s parent company Match Group) were made public by a Danish researcher some commentators have labelled a “white supremacist”, who used the data to try to establish a link between intelligence and religious beliefs. The data is still out there.\nSo why does Tinder need all that information on you? “To personalise the experience for each of our users around the world,” according to a Tinder spokesperson. “Our matching tools are dynamic and consider various factors when displaying potential matches in order to personalise the experience for each of our users.”\nUnfortunately when asked how those matches are personalised using my information, and which kinds of profiles I will be shown as a result, Tinder was less than forthcoming.\n“Our matching tools are a core part of our technology and intellectual property, and we are ultimately unable to share information about our these proprietary tools,” the spokesperson said.\nThe trouble is these 800 pages of my most intimate data are actually just the tip of the iceberg. “Your personal data affects who you see first on Tinder, yes,” says Dehaye. “But also what job offers you have access to on LinkedIn, how much you will pay for insuring your car, which ad you will see in the tube and if you can subscribe to a loan.\n“We are leaning towards a more and more opaque society, towards an even more intangible world where data collected about you will decide even larger facets of your life. Eventually, your whole existence will be affected.”\nTinder is often compared to a bar full of singles, but it’s more like a bar full of single people chosen for me while studying my behaviour, reading my diary and with new people constantly selected based on my live reactions.\nAs a typical millennial constantly glued to my phone, my virtual life has fully merged with my real life.

{"num":8,"Time":"Sun 18 Jul 2021 20.53 CEST","Title":"Huge data leak shatters the lie that the innocent need not fear surveillance","Content":"Billions of people are inseparable from their phones. Their devices are within reach – and earshot – for almost every daily experience, from the most mundane to the most intimate.\nFew pause to think that their phones can be transformed into surveillance devices, with someone thousands of miles away silently extracting their messages, photos and location, activating their microphone to record them in real time.\nSuch are the capabilities of Pegasus, the spyware manufactured by NSO Group, the Israeli purveyor of weapons of mass surveillance.\nNSO rejects this label. It insists only carefully vetted government intelligence and law enforcement agencies can use Pegasus, and only to penetrate the phones of “legitimate criminal or terror group targets”.\nYet in the coming days the Guardian will be revealing the identities of many innocent people who have been identified as candidates for possible surveillance by NSO clients in a massive leak of data.\nWithout forensics on their devices, we cannot know whether governments successfully targeted these people. But the presence of their names on this list indicates the lengths to which governments may go to spy on critics, rivals and opponents.\nQuick Guide\nWhat is in the Pegasus project data?\nShow\nFirst we reveal how journalists across the world were selected as potential targets by these clients prior to a possible hack using NSO surveillance tools.\nOver the coming week we will be revealing the identities of more people whose phone numbers appear in the leak. They include lawyers, human rights defenders, religious figures, academics, businesspeople, diplomats, senior government officials and heads of state.\nOur reporting is rooted in the public interest. We believe the public should know that NSO’s technology is being abused by the governments who license and operate its spyware. But we also believe it is in the public interest to reveal how governments look to spy on their citizens and how seemingly benign processes such as HLR lookups can be exploited in this environment.\nThe Pegasus project is a collaborative reporting project led by the French nonprofit organisation Forbidden Stories, including the Guardian and 16 other media outlets. For months, our journalists have been working with reporters across the world to establish the identities of people in the leaked data and see if and how this links to NSO’s software.\n00:04:55\nPegasus: the spyware technology that threatens democracy – video\nIt is not possible to know without forensic analysis whether the phone of someone whose number appears in the data was actually targeted by a government or whether it was successfully hacked with NSO’s spyware. But when our technical partner, Amnesty International’s Security Lab, conducted forensic analysis on dozens of iPhones that belonged to potential targets at the time they were selected, they found evidence of Pegasus activity in more than half.\nOne phone that has contained signs of Pegasus activity belonged to our esteemed Mexican colleague Carmen Aristegui, whose number was in the data leak and who was targeted following her exposé of a corruption scandal involving her country’s former president Enrique Peña Nieto.\nThe Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui. Photograph: EFE News Agency\/Alamy\nThe data leak suggests that Mexican authorities did not stop at Aristegui. The phone numbers of at least four of her journalist colleagues appear in the leak, as well as her assistant, her sister and her son, who was 16 at the time.\nInvestigating software produced and sold by a company as secretive as NSO is not easy. Its business is surveillance, after all. It meant a radical overhaul of our working methods, including a ban on discussing our work with sources, editors or lawyers in the presence of our phones.\nThe last time the Guardian adopted such extreme counter-espionage measures was in 2013, when reporting on documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Those disclosures pulled back the curtains on the vast apparatus of mass surveillance created after 9\/11 by western intelligence agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA) and its British partner, GCHQ.\nIn doing so, they instigated a global debate about western state surveillance capabilities and led to countries, including the UK, admitting their regulatory regime was out of date and open to potential abuse.\nThe Pegasus project may do the same for the privatised government surveillance industry that has turned NSO into a billion-dollar company.\nCompanies such as NSO operate in a market that is almost entirely unregulated, enabling tools that can be used as instruments of repression for authoritarian regimes such as those in Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.\nThe market for NSO-style surveillance-on-demand services has boomed post-Snowden, whose revelations prompted the mass adoption of encryption across the internet. As a result the internet became far more secure, and mass harvesting of communications much more difficult.\nBut that in turn spurred the proliferation of companies such as NSO offering solutions to governments struggling to intercept messages, emails and calls in transit. The NSO answer was to bypass encryption by hacking devices.\nTwo years ago the then UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, called for a moratorium on the sale of NSO-style spyware to governments until viable export controls could be put in place. He warned of an industry that seemed “out of control, unaccountable and unconstrained in providing governments with relatively low-cost access to the sorts of spying tools that only the most advanced state intelligence services were previously able to use”.\nHis warnings were ignored. The sale of surveillance continued unabated. That GCHQ-like surveillance tools are now available for purchase by repressive governments may give some of Snowden’s critics pause for thought.\nIn the UK, the whistleblower’s detractors argued breezily that spying was what intelligence agencies were supposed to do. We were assured that innocent citizens in the Five Eyes alliance of intelligence powers, comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US, were safe from abuse. Some invoked the dictum: “If you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear.”\nThe Pegasus project is likely to put an end to any such wishful thinking. Law-abiding people – including citizens and residents of democracies such as the UK, such as editors-in-chief of leading newspapers – are not immune from unwarranted surveillance. And western countries do not have a monopoly on the most invasive surveillance technologies. We’re entering a new surveillance era, and unless protections are put in place, none of us are safe.\nOn Tuesday 27 July, at 8pm BST, join The Guardian’s head of investigations, Paul Lewis, for a livestreamed Guardian Live event on the implications of the Pegasus project.

{"num":14,"Time":"Fri 5 Jun 2015 10.16 CEST","Title":"OPM hack: China blamed for massive breach of US government data","Content":"The Obama administration is scrambling to assess the impact of a massive data breach involving the agency that handles security clearances and US government employee records, with suspicion quickly falling on China, which has been accused of carrying out cyber-espionage against the US in the past.\nGovernment officials familiar with the situation told the Associated Press the hack occurred at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Interior Department, and could potentially affect four million people at every federal agency.\nThe OPM is the human resources department for the federal government and does checks for security clearances.\nA US law enforcement source told the Reuters news agency on Thursday night that a “foreign entity or government” was believed to be behind the attack. Authorities were looking into a possible Chinese connection, the news agency said, quoting a source close to the matter.\nChinese officials issued swift denials, with foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei branding the accusations irresponsible and unscientific at a news briefing on Friday. “We know that hacker attacks are conducted anonymously, across nations, and that it is hard to track the source,” Hong said. “It’s irresponsible and unscientific to make conjectural, trumped-up allegations without deep investigation.”\n“The FBI is conducting an investigation to identify how and why this occurred,” the department of homeland security said in a statement on Thursday. “DHS is continuing to monitor federal networks for any suspicious activity and is working aggressively with the affected agencies to conduct investigative analysis to assess the extent of this alleged intrusion.”\nReports in the New York Times and Washington Post on Thursday, both citing unnamed sources in the federal government, reported Chinese hackers were behind the breach.\nSenator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said the hackers were believed to be based in China.\nCollins, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said the breach was “yet another indication of a foreign power probing successfully and focusing on what appears to be data that would identify people with security clearances”.\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington responded that jumping to conclusions was “not responsible” and “counterproductive”.\nEmbassy spokesman Zhu Haiquan said China had made great efforts to combat cyberattacks and that tracking such events conducted across borders was difficult.\nA Pentagon report in April said hackers associated with the Chinese government repeatedly targeted US military networks seeking intelligence during 2014.\nUS Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House select intelligence committee, said: “The last few months have seen a series of massive data breaches that have affected millions of Americans.\nHe called the latest intrusion “among the most shocking because Americans may expect that federal computer networks are maintained with state-of-the-art defences”.\n“It’s clear that a substantial improvement in our cyber databases and defences is perilously overdue,” Schiff said.\nSenate intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr said the government must overhaul its cybersecurity defenses. “Our response to these attacks can no longer simply be notifying people after their personal information has been stolen,” he said. “We must start to prevent these breaches in the first place.”\nThe largest federal employee union, the AFGE, said it would “demand accountability”. The union’s president, J David Cox, said it was working with the administration to ensure measures were taken to secure the personal information of affected employees.\nIn November a former DHS contractor disclosed another cyber-breach that compromised the private files of more than 25,000 DHS workers and thousands of other federal employees.\nDHS said its intrusion detection system, known as Einstein, which screens federal internet traffic to identify potential cyber threats, identified the hack of OPM’s systems and the Interior Department’s data centre, which is shared by other federal agencies.\n“DHS is continuing to monitor federal networks for any suspicious activity and is working aggressively with the affected agencies to conduct investigative analysis to assess the extent of this alleged intrusion,” the statement said.\nMembers of Congress were briefed on the breach on Thursday.\nThe hack follows an attack on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that compromised the details of 100,000 taxpayers. On Wednesday the IRS commissioner John Koskinen appeared before a Senate committee and blamed the attack on underfunding and the agency’s inability to keep up with increasingly sophisticated threats.\n“This incident provides a stark reminder that even security controls that may have been adequate in the past can be overcome by hackers, who are anonymous, persistent and have access to vast amounts of personal data and knowledge,” J Russell George, treasury inspector general for tax administration, told the Senate finance committee.\nKen Ammon, chief strategy officer at Xceedium, a government security contractor that specialises in securing privileged access to systems, said: “What we are seeing across the board is a particular weakness in our defence systems.”\nAmmon said sophisticated hacking operations funded by nation states were targeting system administrators and gaining access to massive amounts of data. “What you want to be able to do is cut your loses, make sure the attack is isolated to that particular individual and not the terabytes of information stored on the servers.”\nIn April Barack Obama responded to a growing rash of attacks aimed at US computer networks by launching a sanctions program to target individuals and groups outside the United States that use cyber attacks to threaten US foreign policy, national security or economic stability.\nThe move followed indictments of five Chinese military officers who were charged with economic espionage. US officials also pointed the finger directly at North Korea for a high-profile attack on Sony over a film spoof depicting the assassination of North Korea’s leader.\nChina has routinely denied accusations by US investigators that hackers backed by the Chinese government have been behind attacks on US companies and federal agencies.\nObama has moved cybersecurity toward the top of his 2015 agenda after recent breaches and the White House says he raises the issue in meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping. US military officials have become increasingly vocal about cyber espionage and attacks launched by China, Russia and others.\nIn unveiling an updated cyber strategy in May, the US defense secretary, Ash Carter, singled out threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea and stressed the military’s ability to retaliate with cyber weapons.\nThe Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of a data breach, but it is not specifically related to a navigation system data leak.

Eldon was fined £60,000 for the latter violation.\nThe fine for Leave.EU’s marketing campaign was £15,000 less than the ICO had initially proposed, after the regulator took account of representations made by the company. One mitigating factor was that the ICO had not received any complaints about the contravention, it said.\nThe referendum campaign sent more than 1m emails to subscribers that contained a banner advertising 10% off insurance at an Eldon brand, GoSkippy. More seriously, it sent almost 50,000 emails out after the referendum, titled “Skippy Saves the Day”, again offering a 10% discount. The campaign negligently disobeyed electronic marketing regulations in doing so, the ICO found.\nElizabeth Denham, the commissioner, said: “It is deeply concerning that sensitive personal data gathered for political purposes was later used for insurance purposes, and vice versa. It should never have happened.\n“We have been told both organisations have made improvements and learned from these events. But the ICO will now audit the organisations to determine how they are using customers’ personal information.”\nThe ICO will begin a full audit of Eldon and Leave.EU’s joint offices, staff and records, looking for evidence of whether or not the two companies followed data protection guidelines in processing personal information, how they trained staff and what policies and procedures they had in place.\nThe results of that audit, which will include interviewing the directors and staff, will be made public. The ICO noted “it is a criminal offence to obstruct an ICO audit or destroy information covered by it”.\nLeave.EU is already being investigated by the National Crime Agency over a multimillion-pound donation the Electoral Commission believes came from Rock Holdings, one of Banks’s companies that is based in the Isle of Man, and thus not legally allowed to participate in UK elections.\nLeave.EU and Eldon Insurance have been approached for comment.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the JSON format response based on the provided news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": {\n    \"Reason\": \"Data Protection Violations\",\n    \"Details\": [\n      {\n        \"Organization\": \"Leave.EU and Arron Banks' insurance firm\",\n        \"Fines\": \"£120,000 in total\",\n        \"Violation\": \"Data protection violations during the EU referendum campaign\",\n        \"Specific_Violations\": [\n          {\n            \"Leave.EU\": {\n              \"Fines\": [\n                {\n                  \"Unlawful Use of Customer Details\": \"£15,000\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"Sending Unauthorized Marketing Messages\": \"£45,000\"\n                }\n              ],\n              \"Involvement\": \"Using Eldon Insurance customer data for political marketing messages.\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"Eldon Insurance\": {\n              \"Fines\": [\n                {\n                  \"Sending Unauthorized Marketing Campaign\": \"£60,000\"\n                }\n              ],\n              \"Involvement\": \"Sending unauthorized marketing campaigns to political subscribers.\"\n            }\n          }\n        ],\n        \"ICO Audit\": \"The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) intends to audit Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance to determine how they are using customers' personal information, including staff training, policies, and procedures.\",\n        \"Investigations\": [\n          {\n            \"National Crime Agency\": \"Investigating Leave.EU over a donation believed to have come from one of Arron Banks's companies, which is not legally allowed to participate in UK elections.\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\nThis news is relevant to the topic of data protection violations, which is similar to a data leak in the sense that it involves mishandling of personal data.

Can AI help make the company relevant again?\nRead more\nThe DPC punishment relates to a legal challenge brought by an Austrian privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, over concerns resulting from the Edward Snowden revelations that European users’ data is not sufficiently protected from US intelligence agencies when it is transferred across the Atlantic.\nMeta has also been given six months to stop “the unlawful processing, including storage, in the US” of personal EU data already transferred across the Atlantic, meaning that user data will need to be removed from Facebook servers.\nThe ruling does not affect data transfers at Meta’s other main platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta said it would appeal against the decision and seek a stay on the data transfer order.\nThe DPC said Meta infringed GDPR by continuing to transfer EU user data to the US without proper safeguards in place, despite a ruling by the European court of justice in 2020 requiring robust protection of that information. The CJEU ruled that data leaving the EU must have the same level of protection as it would have under GDPR when it reaches its destination outside the EU.\nThe regulator said data transferred by Facebook under a legal instrument called standard contractual clauses (SCCs) “did not address the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects that were identified by the [court of justice] in its judgment”.\nMeta, whose EU base is in Ireland, said it had been “singled out” by the DPC despite thousands of other businesses using the same data transfer processes.\n“We are … disappointed to have been singled out when using the same legal mechanism as thousands of other companies looking to provide services in Europe,” wrote Nick Clegg, the Meta president of global affairs, and Jennifer Newstead, the Meta chief legal officer, in a blog post on Monday.\nClegg and Newstead added: “This decision is flawed, unjustified and sets a dangerous precedent for the countless other companies transferring data between the EU and US.” They said the internet risked being carved up into national and regional silos as a result.\nA spokesperson for the European Commission – the EU’s executive arm – said it hoped a new framework for transatlantic data transfers would be “fully functional by the summer” which would provide the “stability and legal certainty” sought by US tech companies. Facebook would be able to resume data transfers under the new data regime, which has been agreed between Washington and Brussels at a political level but still requires agreement on implementation.\nThe spokesperson said it was “very clear” that the EU had worked with the US on putting “safeguards” protecting consumer data in place and it hoped to restore legal certainty.\nSign up to Business Today\nFree daily newsletter\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, in Meta’s most recent quarterly results, the company said that without SCCs or “other alternative means of data transfers” it would “likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe”.\nMeta reported net income, a US measure of profit, of $23.2bn last year. Shares in Meta were up 2.2% in midday trading on Monday, valuing the company at more than $640bn.\nThe DPC said it had disagreed with other EU regulators over Meta’s punishment, which resulted in the European Data Protection Board, comprised of EU data watchdogs, stepping in to decide whether a fine should be imposed. The previous record GDPR fine was €746m imposed on Amazon by Luxembourg in 2021.\nEddie Powell, a data protection partner at UK law firm Fladgate, said an appeal was unlikely to reverse all of the decision. “At the heart of the issue is the US government’s ability under US law to access EU personal data held by US corporations on the grounds of national security, without any effective safeguard or checks,’” he said.\nPowell added that the fine reflected the fact that “Meta’s systems were structured so that all data collected on its social media platforms had to be sent to the US, without any kind of firebreak”.\nMark Deem, a partner at the UK law firm Wiggin, said the size of the fine would send a message to other businesses that transfer personal data outside the EU. “One of the purposes of the figure is to serve as a warning to other companies about how they handle international data transfers,” he said.\nThe UK data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office, said: “We have noted the decision and will review the details in due course.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of data mishandling and privacy concerns, which could be associated with a Navigation system data leak.

According to the Financial Times, reporters posed as prospective clients and secretly filmed a series of meetings, including one with the chief executive. The report is due to air this week.\nCollins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be recalling Nix to give further testimony to explain why he had told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook.\n“We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments,” he said.\nCollins will also call on Zuckerberg to testify. He said the company appeared to have previously sent executives who were able to avoid difficult questions and who “claimed not to know the answers”.\nThe two men may also face a summons from US lawmakers. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Cambridge Analytica to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia.\nThe Republican majority on the House intelligence committee announced this week they were winding up their investigation into Russia’s election interference, concluding there was no collusion with Trump’s campaign and, even more controversially, that Moscow did not seek to assist him. Schiff fiercely condemned that decision and said the Democratic minority would continue working on prescriptions for protecting the country in the future.\n“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump’s political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,” he told the Guardian.\n“The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.”\nTrump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2m, according to Federal Election Commission records. It denies using any Facebook data in the campaign.\nShortly before the story broke, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer that it was making “false and defamatory” allegations and reserved Facebook’s legal position. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by Cambridge Analytica, working with Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), was a data breach.\nIt also suspended the whistleblower Chris Wylie from the platform “pending further information” over misuse of data, along with his former employer Cambridge Analytica and its affiliates, and the academic they worked with, Kogan.\nThe public attack on Wylie came after he had approached the tech company about the data breach, offering to help investigate. He described it as a chilling attack on someone acting in the public interest.\n“They acknowledged my offer but then turned around and shot the messenger. I’m trying to make amends for my mistakes and so should Facebook,” he told the Guardian. “Facebook has known about this for at least two years and did almost nothing to fix it. This is not new. And it’s only by coming forward that Facebook is now taking action. People need to know this kind of profiling is happening.”\nCollins said his committee wanted more information from Facebook about the circumstances around the breach. “Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”\n“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”\nLast month, both Facebook representatives and Nix told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from GSR.\n00:00:25\nCambridge Analytica chief denies working with Facebook data - video\nBut in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix’s company.\n“In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our ‘platform policies’ by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL\/Cambridge Analytica,” the statement said.\nCollins attacked Facebook for appearing to have been “deliberately avoiding answering straight questions” in testimony to the committee.\n“It is now clear that data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns,” Collins said. “Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.”\nCambridge Analytica responded to the Observer story on Twitter before Collins had said Nix would be recalled. “We refute(s) these mischaracterizations and false allegations,” it said.\n“Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data,” the company said. “When we learned GSR sold us Facebook data that it shouldn’t have done, we deleted it all – system wide audit to verify.”\nThe Observer\nThe Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

The Guardian is part of a consortium of media outlets given exclusive access to the data.\nWe can reveal how Credit Suisse repeatedly either opened or maintained bank accounts for a panoramic array of high-risk clients across the world.\nQuick Guide\nSuisse secrets\nShow\nThey include a human trafficker in the Philippines, a Hong Kong stock exchange boss jailed for bribery, a billionaire who ordered the murder of his Lebanese pop star girlfriend and executives who looted Venezuela’s state oil company, as well as corrupt politicians from Egypt to Ukraine.\nOne Vatican-owned account in the data was used to spend €350m (£290m) in an allegedly fraudulent investment in London property that is at the centre of an ongoing criminal trial of several defendants, including a cardinal.\nThe huge trove of banking data was leaked by an anonymous whistleblower to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. “I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral,” the whistleblower source said in a statement. “The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders.”\nThe revelations may fuel questions over whether Credit Suisse’s challenges over the past few years are indicative of a deep malaise at the bank. Composite: Guardian\/David Levene\nCredit Suisse said that Switzerland’s strict banking secrecy laws prevented it from commenting on claims relating to individual clients.\n“Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices,” the bank said in a statement, arguing that the matters uncovered by reporters are based on “selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct.”\nThe bank also said the allegations were largely historical, in some instances dating back to a time when “laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now”.\nWhile some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today.\nZurich\nSwitzerland\nCredit Suisse has more than 1.6tn CHF (£1.3tn) in assets under management and is one of Switzerland’s largest lenders, second only to UBS. It has almost 50,000 employees, including a significant workforce in Zurich, where the bank is headquartered.\nHowever, many of its 3,500 ‘relationship managers’, who find and serve wealthy clients, are spread across the world. The leaked accounts are linked to Credit Suisse clients living in more than 120 jurisdictions, with a concentration of clients in the developing world.\nCountries with some of the largest number of clients in the data, such as Venezuela, Egypt, Ukraine and Thailand, have long struggled with political and financial elites hiding their fortunes offshore.\nGuardian graphic. By Niels de Hoog, Ashley Kirk and Paul Scruton.\nThe timing of the leak could hardly be worse for Credit Suisse, which has recently been beset by major scandals. Last month, it lost its chairman, António Horta-Osório, after he twice broke Covid-19 regulations.\nThat capped an unprecedented year of controversies in which the bank became embroiled in the collapse of the supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital and the US hedge fund Archegos Capital, and was fined £350m over its role in a loan scandal in Mozambique.\nThis month, Credit Suisse became the first major Swiss bank in the country’s history to face criminal charges – which it denies – relating to allegation it helped launder money from the cocaine trade on behalf of the Bulgarian mafia.\nHowever, the repercussions of the leak could be much broader than one bank, threatening a crisis for Switzerland, which retains one of the world’s most secretive banking laws. Swiss financial institutions manage about 7.9tn CHF (£6.3tn) in assets, nearly half of which belongs to foreign clients.\nThe Suisse secrets project sheds a rare light on one of the world’s largest financial centres, which has grown used to operating in the shadows. It identifies the convicts and money launderers who were able to open bank accounts, or keep them open for years after their crimes emerged. And it reveals how Switzerland’s famed banking secrecy laws helped facilitate the looting of countries in the developing world.\nDisgraced executives, fraudsters, traffickers – clients\nWhen Ronald Li Fook-shiu approached a banker to open an account in 2000, he is unlikely to have been viewed as a run-of-the-mill client. A former chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange, he was one of the wealthiest people in the city, where he was known as the “godfather of the stock market”. But he was perhaps better known for the time he spent in a maximum security prison.\nLi’s career had ended in disgrace in 1990, when he was convicted of taking bribes in exchange for listing companies on the stock exchange. However, a decade later Li was nonetheless able to open an account that later held 59m CHF (£26.3m), according to the leak.\nHe has since died, but his case is one of dozens discovered by reporters appearing to show Credit Suisse opened or maintained accounts for clients who had serious convictions that might be expected to show up in due diligence checks. There are other instances in which Credit Suisse may have taken quick action after red flags emerged, but the case nonetheless shows that dubious clients have been attracted to the bank.\nRonald Li Fook-shiu was known as the ‘godfather of the stock market’. Composite: Guardian\/Alamy\nLike every other bank in the world, Credit Suisse professes to have stringent control mechanisms to carry out extensive due diligence on its customers to “ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld”. In banking parlance, such controls are called know-your-client or KYC checks.\nA 2017 leaked report commissioned by Switzerland’s financial regulator shed some light on the bank’s internal procedures at that time. Clients would face intensified scrutiny when flagged as a politically exposed person from a high-risk country, or a person involved in a high-risk activity such as gambling, weapons trading, financial services or mining, the report said.\nRelationship managers were expected to use external sources to verify customers and their risk levels, according to the leak, including news articles or databases such as the Thomson Reuters World-Check platform, which is used widely in the financial services sector to flag when people are arrested, charged, investigated or convicted of a serious crime.\nRodoljub Radulović.\nSuch controls might be expected to prevent a bank from opening accounts for clients such as Rodoljub Radulović, a Serbian securities fraudster indicted in 2001 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the leaked data identifies him as the co-signatory of two Credit Suisse company accounts. The first was opened in 2005, the year after the SEC had secured a default judgment against Radulović for running a pump-and-dump scheme.\nOne of Radulović’s company accounts held 3.4m CHF (£2.2m) before they closed in 2010. He was recently given a 10-year prison sentence by a court in Belgrade for his role trafficking cocaine from South America for the organised crime boss Darko Šarić. Radulović’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nDue diligence is not only for new clients. Banks are required to continually reassess existing customers. The 2017 report said Credit Suisse screened customers at least every three years and as often as once a year for the riskiest clients. Lawyers for Credit Suisse told the Guardian these periodic reviews were introduced “more than 15 years ago”, meaning it was continually running due diligence on existing clients from 2007.\nThe bank might, therefore, have been expected to have discovered that its German client Eduard Seidel was convicted of bribery in 2008. Seidel was an employee of Siemens. As the multinational’s lead in Nigeria, he oversaw a campaign of industrial-scale bribery to secure lucrative contracts for his employer by funnelling cash to corrupt Nigerian politicians.\nEduard Seidel, convicted of bribery in 2008. Composite: Handout\nAfter German authorities raided the Munich headquarters of Siemens in 2006, Seidel immediately confessed his role in the bribery scheme, though he said he had never stolen from the company or appropriated its slush funds. His involvement in the corruption led to his name being entered into the Thomson Reuters World-Check database in 2007.\nHowever, the leaked Credit Suisse data shows his accounts were left open until at least well into the last decade. At one point after he left Siemens, one account was worth 54m CHF (£24m). Seidel’s lawyer declined to say whether the accounts were his. He said his client had addressed all outstanding matters relating to his bribery offences and wished to move on with his life.\nThe lawyer did not respond to repeated invitations to explain the source of the 54m CHF. Siemens said it did not know about the money and that its review of its own cashflows shed no light on the account.\nWhile Credit Suisse said in its statement it could not comment on any specific clients, the bank said “actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed”.\nIn some instances, Credit Suisse is understood to have frozen accounts belonging to problematic clients. Yet questions remain about how quickly the bank moved to close them.\nOne client, Stefan Sederholm, a Swedish computer technician who opened an account with Credit Suisse in 2008, was able to keep it open for two-and-a-half years after his widely reported conviction for human trafficking in the Philippines, for which he was given a life sentence.\nStefan Sederholm. Composite: AFP\nSederholm’s crime first came to light in 2009, when police in Manila raided a storefront purporting to be the local chapter of the Mindanao Peoples’ Peace Movement, and discovered about 17 women in cubicles with webcams performing sex shows for foreign customers. He was convicted in 2011.\nA representative for Sederholm said Credit Suisse never froze his accounts and did not close them until 2013 when he was unable to provide due diligence material. Asked why Sederholm needed a Swiss account, they said that he was living in Thailand when it was opened, adding: “Can you please tell me if you would prefer to put your money in a Thai or Swiss bank?”\nFerdinand and Imelda pillage the Philippines\nSwiss banks have cultivated their trusted reputation since as far back as 1713, when the Great Council of Geneva prohibited bankers from revealing details about the fortunes being deposited by European aristocrats. Switzerland soon became a tax haven for many of the world’s elites and its bankers nurtured a “duty of absolute silence” about their clients’ affairs.\nThe custom was enshrined in statute in 1934 with the introduction of Switzerland’s banking secrecy law, which criminalised the disclosure of client banking information to foreign authorities. Within decades, wealthy clients from all over the world were flocking to Swiss banks. Sometimes, that meant clients with something to hide.\nOne of the most notorious cases in Credit Suisse’s history involved the corrupt Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The couple are estimated to have siphoned as much as $10bn from the Philippines during the three terms Ferdinand was president, which ended in 1986.\nCredit Suisse helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos open Swiss accounts under fake names. Composite: Guardian\nIt has long been known that Credit Suisse was one of the first banks to help the Marcoses ravage their own country and in one infamous episode even helped them open Swiss accounts under the fake names “William Saunders” and “Jane Ryan”. In 1995, a Zurich court ordered Credit Suisse and another bank to return $500m of stolen funds to the Philippines.\nThe leaked data contains an account that belonged to Helen Rivilla, an attorney convicted in 1992 for helping launder money on behalf of Ferdinand Marcos. Despite this, she was able to open a Swiss account in 2000, as was her husband, Antonio, who faced similar charges that were subsequently dropped.\nIt is hard to know how Credit Suisse could have missed the money-laundering case linking the couple to the corrupt Philippine leader, which was reported by the Associated Press. The couple, who could not be reached for comment, were able to hold about 8m CHF (£3.6m) with the bank before their accounts were closed in 2006.\nOne former Credit Suisse employee at the time alleges there was a deeply ingrained culture in Swiss banking of looking the other way when it came to problematic clients. “The bank’s compliance departments [were] masters of plausible deniability,” they told a reporter from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of the coordinators of the Suisse secrets project. “Never write anything down that could expose an account that is non-compliant and never ask a question you do not want to know the answer to.”\nThe 2000s was also a decade in which foreign regulators and tax authorities became increasingly frustrated at their inability to penetrate the Swiss financial system. That changed in 2007, when the UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld voluntarily approached US authorities with information about how the bank was helping thousands of wealthy Americans evade tax with secret accounts.\nWe are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland.\nSwiss Bankers Association\nBirkenfeld was viewed as a traitor in Switzerland, where banking whistleblowers are often held in contempt. However, a wide-ranging US Senate investigation later uncovered the aggressive tactics used by UBS and Credit Suisse, the latter of which was found to have sent bankers to high-end events to recruit clients, courted a potential customer with free gold, and in one case even delivered sensitive bank statements hidden in the pages of a Sports Illustrated magazine.\nThe revelations sent shock waves through Switzerland’s financial sector and enraged the US, which pressured Switzerland into unilaterally disclosing which of its taxpayers had secret Swiss accounts from 2014. That same year, Switzerland reluctantly signed up to the international convention on the automatic exchange of banking Information.\nBy adopting the so-called common reporting standard (CRS) for sharing tax data, Switzerland in effect agreed that its banks would in the future exchange information about their clients with tax authorities in foreign countries. They started doing so in 2018.\nMembership of the global exchange system is often cited by Switzerland’s banking industry as a turning point. “There is no longer Swiss bank client confidentiality for clients abroad,” the Swiss Bankers Association told the Guardian. “We are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland.”\nSwitzerland’s almost 90-year-old banking secrecy law, however, remains in force – and was recently broadened. The Tax Justice Network estimates that countries around the world collectively lose $21bn (£15.4bn) each year in tax revenues because of Switzerland. Many of those countries will be poorer nations that have not signed up to the CRS data exchange.\nBanks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime. Composite: Guardian Design\nMore than 90 countries, most of which are in the developing world, remain in the dark when their wealthy taxpayers hide their money in Swiss accounts.\nThis inequity in the system was cited by the whistleblower behind the leaked data, who said the CRS system “imposes a disproportionate financial and infrastructural burden on developing nations, perpetuating their exclusion from the system in the foreseeable future”.\n“This situation enables corruption and starves developing countries of much-needed tax revenue. These countries are the ones that therefore suffer most from Switzerland’s reverse-Robin-Hood stunt,” they said.\nThe whistleblower acknowledged that the leak would contain accounts that were legitimate and declared by the client to their tax authority.\n“I am aware that having an offshore Swiss bank account does not necessarily imply tax evasion or any other financial crime,” they said. “However, it is likely that a significant number of these accounts were opened with the sole purpose of hiding their holder’s wealth from fiscal institutions and\/or avoiding the payment of taxes on capital gains.”\nIt was not possible for journalists in the Suisse secrets project to establish how many of the more than 18,000 accounts in the leak were declared to relevant tax authorities.\nQuick Guide\nSuisse secrets media partners\nShow\nMedia partners in the consortium wrote to more than 100 Credit Suisse clients in the data, asking whether they had disclosed their Swiss accounts to tax authorities. Five confirmed they had done so. Six said they were not required to declare their Swiss accounts. No others replied.\nLinks to another dictator … and another\nFerdinand Marcos may have been Credit Suisse’s most notorious client. He is arguably rivalled only by relatives of the brutal Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha, who is believed to have stolen as much as $5bn from his people in just six years. It has long been known that Credit Suisse provided services to Abacha’s sons, opening Swiss accounts in which they deposited $214m.\nCredit Suisse was publicly contrite after being kicked off a sustainable investment index over the affair. “We understand that the index was not really happy with us being involved with Abacha – we were not happy ourselves,” a spokesperson said in 1999. “But we have addressed those problems and for several years we have taken internal measures to make sure nothing similar happens in the future.”\nBanks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime. The consequences for already impoverished populations can be devastating, as state coffers are siphoned, basic standards are eroded and trust in democracy plummets.\nPoliticians and state officials are among the riskiest customers for banks because of their access to public funds, particularly in developing nations with fewer legal safeguards against corruption. Banks and other financial institutions are required to subject politically exposed persons, or PEPs, to the most stringent checks, known as “enhanced due diligence”.\nThe leaked Credit Suisse data is peppered with politicians and their allies who have been linked to corruption before, during or after they had their accounts. None are as well known as the Marcoses or the Abachas, but several wielded great power in countries from Syria to Madagascar, where they amassed personal fortunes.\nThey include Pavlo Lazarenko, who served a corrupt single year as prime minister of Ukraine between 1997 and 1998 before applying for an account at Credit Suisse. One month after pressure from rivals forced Lazarenko to announce his resignation, he opened his first of two Credit Suisse accounts. One was later valued at almost 8m CHF (£3.6m).\nPavlo Lazarenko, former Ukrainian prime minister. Composite: Guardian\/Alamy\nLazarenko was later estimated by Transparency International to have looted $200m from the Ukrainian government, allegedly by threatening to harm businesses unless they paid him 50% of their profits. He pleaded guilty to money laundering in Switzerland in 2000, and was later indicted in the US for corruption and sentenced to nine years in prison in 2006 in relation to bribes received from a Ukrainian businessman.\nHis lawyer said those convictions did not relate to the theft of any money from the people of Ukraine. Lazarenko, who reportedly lives in California, has resisted returning to the country, where he still faces accusations he stole $17m. His lawyer said his Credit Suisse accounts had not been accessed for two decades and were frozen in connection with court proceedings against him.\nIt remains unclear why Credit Suisse allowed Lazarenko to open an account and deposit such huge sums in the first place, given his background; before entering politics, Lazarenko was a functionary in charge of a collective farm.\nMonika Roth, an expert on money laundering and a professor at Lucerne University, said Swiss banks had for a long time struggled to properly challenge politicians and public officials who, after stints in public office on relatively modest salaries, turned up with huge sums to deposit. She said: “Nobody wants to have asked the question: how is that possible?”\nAround the time it was doing business with Lazarenko, Credit Suisse appears to have also made inroads into the Egyptian political establishment under the dictator Hosni Mubarak, who was president for three decades until 2011. The bank’s clients included Mubarak’s sons, Alaa and Gamal, who established business empires in Egypt.\nAlaa and Gamal Mubarak. Composite: Guardian\nThe brothers’ relationship with the bank spanned decades, with the earliest joint account opened by the brothers in 1993. By 2010 – the year before the popular revolt that ousted their father – an account belonging to Alaa held 232m CHF (£138m).\nAfter the Arab spring uprisings their fortunes changed, and in 2015 the brothers and their father were sentenced to three years in jail by an Egyptian court for embezzlement and corruption. They say the case was politically motivated, but after an unsuccessful appeal Alaa and Gamal paid an estimated $17.6m to the Egyptian government in a settlement agreement that made no admissions of guilt.\nLawyers for the brothers reject any suggestion they were corrupt, saying their rights were violated during the Egyptian case, and 10 years of wide-ranging and intrusive investigations into their global assets by foreign authorities has not uncovered any legal violations. They added that their Swiss accounts had been frozen for over a decade, pending the resolution of investigations by the Swiss authorities.\nOther Credit Suisse clients linked to Hosni Mubarak were the late tycoon Hussein Salem – who acted as a financial consigliere for the dictator for nearly three decades, amassed a fortune through preferred tender deals and died in exile after facing money-laundering charges – and Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a billionaire politician in Mubarak’s party.\nHisham Talaat Mustafa (left) and Hussein Salem. Composite: AP\/EPA\nMoustafa, who could not be reached for comment, was convicted in 2009 of hiring a hitman to murder his ex-girlfriend, the Lebanese pop star Suzanne Tamim – but his account was not closed until 2014.\nAnother Mubarak henchman linked to Credit Suisse’s banking services was his former spy chief Omar Suleiman. His associates are listed in the data as beneficial owners of an account that held 63m CHF (£26m) in 2007. Suleiman was a feared figure in Egypt, where he oversaw widespread torture and human rights abuses.\nOmar Suleiman. Composite: Alamy\nThe data reveals Credit Suisse accounts held by several more intelligence and military figures and their family members, including in Pakistan, Jordan, Yemen and Iraq. One Algerian client was Khaled Nezzar, who served as minister of defence until 1993 and participated in a coup that precipitated a brutal civil war in which the military junta he was part of was accused of disappearances, mass detentions, torture and execution of detainees.\nNezzar’s alleged role in human rights abuses had been widely documented by 2004, when his account was opened. It contained a maximum balance of 2m CHF (£900,000) and remained open until 2013, two years after he was arrested in Switzerland for suspected war crimes. He denies wrongdoing and the investigation is ongoing.\nIf ordinary Algerians, Egyptians and Ukrainians have reason to complain that Credit Suisse may have aided nefarious leaders, their grievances pale in comparison with Venezuelans.\nKhaled Nezzar. Composite: Guardian\nReporters working on the Suisse secrets project identified Credit Suisse accounts linked to almost two dozen business people, officials and politicians implicated in corrupt schemes in Venezuela, most of which revolved around the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).\n“Corruption has always been around in PDVSA, in varying degrees and levels,” said César Mata-Garcia, an academic at the University of Dundee specialising in international petroleum law. “The words ‘Venezuela’, ‘PDVSA’ and ‘oil’ are an alarm bell for banks.”\nIf so, that does not appear to have stopped Credit Suisse acquiring clients later revealed to be involved in numerous US investigations and prosecutions linked to PDVSA and the looting of the Venezuelan economy.\nOne case involves two US-based businessmen with Venezuelan connections, Roberto Rincón Fernández and Abraham Shiera Bastidas, who in 2009 set about bribing officials in exchange for lucrative PDVSA contracts with the help of an associate, Fernando Ardila Rueda. Among those who allegedly received bungs were the energy vice-minister, Nervis Villalobos Cárdenas, and a senior PDVSA official, Luis De Léon Perez.\nFrom left: Nervis Villalobos Cárdenas, Roberto Rincón Fernández, Abraham Shiera Bastidas and Luis De Léon Perez. Composite: Guardian\nIn 2015, US prosecutors began indicting the participants; court papers make repeated reference to payments into accounts in an unnamed Swiss bank. However, the leaked data reveals all five men had Credit Suisse accounts active at the time of the offences. Of the five, four have pleaded guilty. The exception, Villalobos, is resisting extradition to the US from Spain.\nSome of the Venezuela-linked Credit Suisse accounts contained enormous sums; Villalobos had as much as 9.5m CHF (£6.3m) in his account and De Léon had as much as 22m (£15.5m). Rincón, the businessman paying their bribes, had more than 68m CHF (£44.2m) in his account as of November 2015, the month prior to his arrest.\n‘How many rogue bankers before you become a rogue bank?’\nWhen Credit Suisse’s ornate headquarters were constructed in the 1870s in Zurich, they were designed to symbolise “Switzerland as a financial centre”. More than 150 years later, Credit Suisse occupies the same grand premises and Switzerland remains a global offshore centre, much as it has done for the last 300 years.\nIt is only in recent decades that Credit Suisse, one of Switzerland’s oldest and most cherished banks, acquired its reputation for calamity. As one commentator observed earlier this week: “The bank boasts that its purpose is to serve its wealthy clients ‘with care and entrepreneurial spirit’, but at this stage most of them would probably be happy if it could just avoid yet another major scandal.”\nHorta-Osório lasted less than a year before resigning last month. Shortly after Credit Suisse appointed its new chairman, Axel Lehmann, the bank reported a loss of 1.6bn CHF (£1.3bn) in the fourth quarter, in part because it had put aside more than 400m CHF (£320m) to deal with unspecified “legacy litigation matters”.\nAnd there is no shortage of those. The scandals involving Greensill, Archegos and Mozambique bonds have dogged the bank over the past year.\nOver the past three decades, Credit Suisse has faced at least a dozen penalties and sanctions for offences involving tax evasion, money laundering, the deliberate violation of US sanctions and frauds carried out against its own customers that span multiple decades and jurisdictions. In total, it has racked up more than $4.2bn in fines or settlements.\nSome of the accounts in the leak remain open today. Composite: Guardian\nThat includes the $2.6bn the Swiss bank agreed to pay US authorities after pleading guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion in 2014; the $536m it was fined by the US five years before for deliberately circumventing US sanctions against countries including Iran and Sudan in 2009, and other payouts to Germany and Italy over tax evasion allegations.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Suisse secrets revelations may fuel questions over whether Credit Suisse’s challenges are indicative of a deep malaise at the bank.\nJeff Neiman, a Florida-based attorney who represents a number of Credit Suisse whistleblowers, believes the sheer number of scandals involving the bank indicates a deeper problem.\n“The bank likes to say it’s just rogue bankers. But how many rogue bankers do you need to have before you start having a rogue bank?” he said. Neiman alleges there has been a culture at the bank “which encourages its bankers probably from the top down to hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, bury their heads in the sand on a good day, and on many days, actively assist folks to skirt whatever the law may be in order to best protect assets under management”.”\nSuch allegations are strongly rejected by Credit Suisse. “In line with financial reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime,” the bank said in its statement, adding that it upheld “the highest standards of conduct”.\nIts lawyers said it had fully cooperated with many of the investigations cited by the Guardian and that any past individual failings by the bank did not reflect its current business policies, practices or culture. In November, it announced it would put “risk management at the very core of the bank”.\nThe bank said its “preliminary review” of the accounts flagged by the Suisse secrets reporting project had established that more than 90% of those reviewed were now closed or “were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries”. Of the remaining accounts, which remain active, the bank said it was “comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control-related steps were taken, including pending account closures”.\nThe Credit Suisse statement added: “These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit the bank and the Swiss financial marketplace, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years.”\nThe debate over whether Switzerland’s banking industry has undergone sufficient reforms is likely to be renewed in light of the leak. The whistleblower who shared the data suggested that banks alone should not be blamed for the state of affairs, as they are “simply being good capitalists by maximising profits within the legal framework they operate in”.\n“Simply put, Swiss legislators are responsible for enabling financial crimes and – by virtue of their direct democracy – the Swiss people have the power to do something about it. While I am aware that banking secrecy laws are partly responsible for the Swiss economic success story, it is my strong opinion that such a wealthy country should be able to afford a conscience.”\n* Currency conversions are based on historical rates.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of a data leak, but it does not specifically pertain to a Navigation system data leak.

{"num":23,"Time":"Mon 11 Jul 2022 18.11 CEST","Title":"Uber broke laws, duped police and secretly lobbied governments, leak reveals","Content":"A\nleaked trove of confidential files has revealed the inside story of how the tech giant Uber flouted laws, duped police, exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments during its aggressive global expansion.\n\nThe unprecedented leak to the Guardian of more than 124,000 documents – known as the Uber files – lays bare the ethically questionable practices that fuelled the company’s transformation into one of Silicon Valley’s most famous exports.\nThe leak spans a five-year period when Uber was run by its co-founder Travis Kalanick, who tried to force the cab-hailing service into cities around the world, even if that meant breaching laws and taxi regulations.\nDuring the fierce global backlash, the data shows how Uber tried to shore up support by discreetly courting prime ministers, presidents, billionaires, oligarchs and media barons.\nFrench taxi drivers protesting against private hire services such as Uber. Photograph: Olivier Coret\/Rex\/Shutterstock\nLeaked messages suggest Uber executives were at the same time under no illusions about the company’s law-breaking, with one executive joking they had become “pirates” and another conceding: “We’re just fucking illegal.”\nOn Monday, Mark MacGann, Uber’s former chief lobbyist for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, came forward to identify himself as the source of the leaked data. “It is my duty to speak up and help governments and parliamentarians right some fundamental wrongs,” he said. “Morally, I had no choice in the matter.”\nThe cache of files, which span 2013 to 2017, includes more than 83,000 emails, iMessages and WhatsApp messages, including often frank and unvarnished communications between Kalanick and his top team of executives.\nQ&A\nWhat are the Uber files?\nShow\n\nIn one exchange, Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry. “I think it’s worth it,” he shot back. “Violence guarantee[s] success.”\nIn a statement, Kalanick’s spokesperson said he “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety” and any suggestion he was involved in such activity would be completely false.\nThe leak also contains texts between Kalanick and Emmanuel Macron, who secretly helped the company in France when he was economy minister, allowing Uber frequent and direct access to him and his staff.\nMacron, the French president, appears to have gone to extraordinary lengths to help Uber, even telling the company he had brokered a secret “deal” with its opponents in the French cabinet.\nPrivately, Uber executives expressed barely disguised disdain for other elected officials who were less receptive to the company’s business model.\nAfter the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who was mayor of Hamburg at the time, pushed back against Uber lobbyists and insisted on paying drivers a minimum wage, an executive told colleagues he was “a real comedian”.\nWhen the then US vice-president, Joe Biden, a supporter of Uber at the time, was late to a meeting with the company at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Kalanick texted a colleague: “I’ve had my people let him know that every minute late he is, is one less minute he will have with me.”\nAfter meeting Kalanick, Biden appears to have amended his prepared speech at Davos to refer to a CEO whose company would give millions of workers “freedom to work as many hours as they wish, manage their own lives as they wish”.\nThe Guardian led a global investigation into the leaked Uber files, sharing the data with media organisations around the world via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). More than 180 journalists at 40 media outlets including Le Monde, Washington Post and the BBC will in the coming days publish a series of investigative reports about the tech giant.\nIn a statement responding to the leak, Uber admitted to “mistakes and missteps”, but said it had been transformed since 2017 under the leadership of its current chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi.\n“We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values,” it said. “Instead, we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.”\nKalanick’s spokesperson said Uber’s expansion initiatives were “led by over a hundred leaders in dozens of countries around the world and at all times under the direct oversight and with the full approval of Uber’s robust legal, policy and compliance groups”.\n‘Embrace the chaos’\nThe leaked documents pull back the curtains on the methods Uber used to lay the foundations for its empire. One of the world’s largest work platforms, Uber is now a $43bn (£36bn) company, making approximately 19m journeys a day.\nThe files cover Uber’s operations across 40 countries during a period in which the company became a global behemoth, bulldozing its cab-hailing service into many of the cities in which it still operates today.\nAn Uber car in Moscow. Photograph: Fifg\/Alamy\nFrom Moscow to Johannesburg, bankrolled with unprecedented venture capital funding, Uber heavily subsidised journeys, seducing drivers and passengers on to the app with incentives and pricing models that would not be sustainable.\nUber undercut established taxi and cab markets and put pressure on governments to rewrite laws to help pave the way for an app-based, gig-economy model of work that has since proliferated across the world.\nIn a bid to quell the fierce backlash against the company and win changes to taxi and labour laws, Uber planned to spend an extraordinary $90m in 2016 on lobbying and public relations, one document suggests.\nIts strategy often involved going over the heads of city mayors and transport authorities and straight to the seat of power.\nIn addition to meeting Biden at Davos, Uber executives met face-to-face with Macron, the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and George Osborne, the UK’s chancellor at the time. A note from the meeting portrayed Osborne as a “strong advocate”.\nIn a statement, Osborne said it was the explicit policy of the government at the time to meet with global tech firms and “persuade them to invest in Britain, and create jobs here”.\nWhile the Davos sitdown with Osborne was declared, the data reveals that six UK Tory cabinet ministers had meetings with Uber that were not disclosed. It is unclear if the meetings should have been declared, exposing confusion around how UK lobbying rules are applied.\nTaxis block Whitehall during a protest against a decision to grant Uber a licence to operate in London in 2016. Photograph: Andy Rain\/EPA\nThe documents indicate Uber was adept at finding unofficial routes to power, applying influence through friends or intermediaries, or seeking out encounters with politicians at which aides and officials were not present.\nIt enlisted the backing of powerful figures in places such as Russia, Italy and Germany by offering them prized financial stakes in the startup and turning them into “strategic investors”.\nAnd in a bid to shape policy debates, it paid prominent academics hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce research that supported the company’s claims about the benefits of its economic model.\nDespite a well-financed and dogged lobbying operation, Uber’s efforts had mixed results. In some places Uber succeeded in persuading governments to rewrite laws, with lasting effects. But elsewhere, the company found itself blocked by entrenched taxi industries, outgunned by local cab-hailing rivals or opposed by leftwing politicians who simply refused to budge.\nA demonstrator holds a flare during a Paris protest against Uber. Photograph: François Mori\/AP\nWhen faced with opposition, Uber sought to turn it to its advantage, seizing upon it to fuel the narrative its technology was disrupting antiquated transport systems, and urging governments to reform their laws.\nAs Uber launched across India, Kalanick’s top executive in Asia urged managers to focus on driving growth, even when “fires start to burn”. “Know this is a normal part of Uber’s business,” he said. “Embrace the chaos. It means you’re doing something meaningful.”\nKalanick appeared to put that ethos into practice in January 2016, when Uber’s attempts to upend markets in Europe led to angry protests in Belgium, Spain, Italy and France from taxi drivers who feared for their livelihoods.\nAmid taxi strikes and riots in Paris, Kalanick ordered French executives to retaliate by encouraging Uber drivers to stage a counter-protest with mass civil disobedience.\nWarned that doing so risked putting Uber drivers at risk of attacks from “extreme right thugs” who had infiltrated the taxi protests and were “spoiling for a fight”, Kalanick appeared to urge his team to press ahead regardless. “I think it’s worth it,” he said. “Violence guarantee[s] success. And these guys must be resisted, no? Agreed that right place and time must be thought out.”\nThe decision to send Uber drivers into potentially volatile protests, despite the risks, was consistent with what one senior former executive told the Guardian was a strategy of “weaponising” drivers, and exploiting violence against them to “keep the controversy burning”.\nIt was a playbook that, leaked emails suggest, was repeated in Italy, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands.\nWhen masked men, reported to be angry taxi drivers, turned on Uber drivers with knuckle-dusters and a hammer in Amsterdam in March 2015, Uber staffers sought to turn it to their advantage to win concessions from the Dutch government.\nDriver victims were encouraged to file police reports, which were shared with De Telegraaf, the leading Dutch daily newspaper. They “will be published without our fingerprint on the front page tomorrow”, one manager wrote. “We keep the violence narrative going for a few days, before we offer the solution.”\nKalanick’s spokesperson questioned the authenticity of some documents. She said Kalanick “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety” and any suggestion that he was involved in such activity would be “completely false”.\nUber’s spokesperson also acknowledged past mistakes in the company’s treatment of drivers but said no one, including Kalanick, wanted violence against Uber drivers. “There is much our former CEO said nearly a decade ago that we would certainly not condone today,” she said. “But one thing we do know and feel strongly about is that no one at Uber has ever been happy about violence against a driver.”\nThe ‘kill switch’\nUber drivers were undoubtedly the target of vicious assaults and sometimes murders by furious taxi drivers. And the cab-hailing app, in some countries, found itself battling entrenched and monopolised taxi fleets with cosy relationships with city authorities. Uber often characterised its opponents in the regulated taxi markets as operating a “cartel”.\nHowever, privately, Uber executives and staffers appear to have been in little doubt about the often rogue nature of their own operation.\n\nIn internal emails, staff referred to Uber’s “other than legal status”, or other forms of active non-compliance with regulations, in countries including Turkey, South Africa, Spain, the Czech Republic, Sweden, France, Germany, and Russia.\n\nOne senior executive wrote in an email: “We are not legal in many countries, we should avoid making antagonistic statements.” Commenting on the tactics the company was prepared to deploy to “avoid enforcement”, another executive wrote: “We have officially become pirates.”\nNairi Hourdajian, Uber’s head of global communications, put it even more bluntly in a message to a colleague in 2014, amid efforts to shut the company down in Thailand and India: “Sometimes we have problems because, well, we’re just fucking illegal.” Contacted by the Guardian, Hourdajian declined to comment.\nKalanick’s spokesperson accused reporters of “pressing its false agenda” that he had “directed illegal or improper conduct”.\nUber’s spokesperson said that, when it started, “ridesharing regulations did not exist anywhere in the world” and transport laws were outdated for a smartphone era.\nAcross the world, police, transport officials and regulatory agencies sought to clamp down on Uber. In some cities, officials downloaded the app and hailed rides so they could crack down on unlicensed taxi journeys, fining Uber drivers and impounding their cars. Uber offices in dozens of countries were repeatedly raided by authorities.\nAgainst this backdrop, Uber developed sophisticated methods to thwart law enforcement. One was known internally at Uber as a “kill switch”. When an Uber office was raided, executives at the company frantically sent out instructions to IT staff to cut off access to the company’s main data systems, preventing authorities from gathering evidence.\nThe leaked files suggest the technique, signed off by Uber’s lawyers, was deployed at least 12 times during raids in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, India, Hungary and Romania.\nTravis Kalanick speaking to students in Mumbai in 2016. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui\/Reuters\nKalanick’s spokesperson said such “kill switch” protocols were common business practice and not designed to obstruct justice. She said the protocols, which did not delete data, were vetted and approved by Uber’s legal department, and the former Uber CEO was never charged in relation to obstruction of justice or a related offence.\nThe Uber campaign: how ex-Obama aides helped sell firm to world\nRead more\nUber’s spokesperson said its kill switch software “should never have been used to thwart legitimate regulatory action” and it had stopped using the system in 2017, when Khosrowshahi replaced Kalanick as CEO.\nAnother executive the leaked files suggest was involved in kill switch protocols was Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, who ran Uber’s operations in western Europe. He now runs Uber Eats, and sits on the company’s 11-strong executive team.\nGore-Coty said in a statement he regretted “some of the tactics used to get regulatory reform for ridesharing in the early days”. Looking back, he said: “I was young and inexperienced and too often took direction from superiors with questionable ethics.”\nPoliticians now also face questions about whether they took direction from Uber executives.\nWhen a French police official in 2015 appeared to ban one of Uber’s services in Marseille, MacGann, Uber’s chief lobbyist in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, turned to Uber’s ally in the French cabinet.\n“I will look at this personally,” Macron texted back. “At this point, let’s stay calm.”\nUber files reporting: Harry Davies, Simon Goodley, Felicity Lawrence, Paul Lewis, Lisa O’Carroll, John Collingridge, Johana Bhuiyan, Sam Cutler, Rob Davies, Stephanie Kirchgaessner, Jennifer Rankin, Jon Henley, Rowena Mason, Andrew Roth, Pamela Duncan, Dan Milmo, Mike Safi, David Pegg and Ben Butler.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The provided news article is relevant to the topic of a data leak.

At the time Dropbox reported a collection of user’s email addresses had been stolen. It did not report that passwords had been stolen as well.\nThe dump of passwords came to light when the database was picked up by security notification service Leakbase, which sent it to Motherboard.\nThe independent security researcher and operator of the Have I been pwned? data leak database, Troy Hunt, verified the data discovering both his account details and that of his wife.\nHunt said: “There is no doubt whatsoever that the data breach contains legitimate Dropbox passwords, you simply can’t fabricate this sort of thing.”\nDropbox sent out notifications last week to all users who had not changed their passwords since 2012. The company had around 100m customers at the time, meaning the data dump represents over two-thirds of its user accounts. At the time Dropbox practiced good user data security practice, encrypting the passwords and appears to have been in the process of upgrading the encryption from the SHA1 standard to a more secure standard called bcrypt.\nHalf the passwords were still encrypted with SHA1 at the time of the theft.\n“The bcrypt hashing algorithm protecting [the passwords] is very resilient to cracking and frankly, all but the worst possible password choices are going to remain secure even with the breach now out in the public,” said Hunt. “Definitely still change your password if you’re in any doubt whatsoever and make sure you enable Dropbox’s two-step verification while you’re there if it’s not on already.”\nThe original breach appears to be the result of the reuse of a password a Dropbox employee had previously used on LinkedIn, the professional social network that suffered a breach that revealed the password and allowed the hackers to enter Dropbox’s corporate network. From there they gained access to the user database with passwords that were encrypted and “salted” – the latter a practice of adding a random string of characters during encryption to make it even harder to decrypt.\nDropbox reset a number of users’ passwords at the time, but the company has not said precisely how many.\nThe hack highlights the need for tight security, both at the user end – the use of strong passwords, two-step authentication and no reuse of passwords – and for the companies storing user data. Even with solid encryption practices for securing users’ passwords, Dropbox fell foul of password reuse and entry into its company network.\nLeading security experts recommend the use of a password manager to secure the scores of unique and complex passwords needed to properly secure the various login details needed for daily life. But recent attacks on companies including browser maker Opera, which stores and syncs user passwords, and password manager OneLogin, have exposed the dangers of using the tool.\nPicking the right password manager is just as crucial and using one in the first place.\nA Dropbox spokesperson said: “There is no indication that Dropbox user accounts have been improperly accessed. Our analysis confirms that the credentials are user email addresses with hashed and salted passwords that were obtained prior to mid-2012. We can confirm that the scope of the password reset we completed last week did protect all impacted users.”\nSri Lankan teenager hacks president’s website to try to get exams delayed","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is not about a Navigation system data leak.

{"num":37,"Time":"Sun 18 Jul 2021 18.00 CEST","Title":"Revealed: leak uncovers global abuse of cyber-surveillance weapon","Content":"Human rights activists, journalists and lawyers across the world have been targeted by authoritarian governments using hacking software sold by the Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, according to an investigation into a massive data leak.\nThe investigation by the Guardian and 16 other media organisations suggests widespread and continuing abuse of NSO’s hacking spyware, Pegasus, which the company insists is only intended for use against criminals and terrorists.\nPegasus is a malware that infects iPhones and Android devices to enable operators of the tool to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones.\nThe leak contains a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, it is believed, have been identified as those of people of interest by clients of NSO since 2016.\nForbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit media organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the leaked list and shared access with media partners as part of the Pegasus project, a reporting consortium.\nThe presence of a phone number in the data does not reveal whether a device was infected with Pegasus or subject to an attempted hack. However, the consortium believes the data is indicative of the potential targets NSO’s government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance attempts.\nQuick Guide\nWhat is in the Pegasus project data?\nShow\nForensics analysis of a small number of phones whose numbers appeared on the leaked list also showed more than half had traces of the Pegasus spyware.\nThe Guardian and its media partners will be revealing the identities of people whose number appeared on the list in the coming days. They include hundreds of business executives, religious figures, academics, NGO employees, union officials and government officials, including cabinet ministers, presidents and prime ministers.\nThe list also contains the numbers of close family members of one country’s ruler, suggesting the ruler may have instructed their intelligence agencies to explore the possibility of monitoring their own relatives.\nThe disclosures begin on Sunday, with the revelation that the numbers of more than 180 journalists are listed in the data, including reporters, editors and executives at the Financial Times, CNN, the New York Times, France 24, the Economist, Associated Press and Reuters.\nThe phone number of a freelance Mexican reporter, Cecilio Pineda Birto, was found in the list, apparently of interest to a Mexican client in the weeks leading up to his murder, when his killers were able to locate him at a carwash. His phone has never been found so no forensic analysis has been possible to establish whether it was infected.\nNSO said that even if Pineda’s phone had been targeted, it did not mean data collected from his phone contributed in any way to his death, stressing governments could have discovered his location by other means. He was among at least 25 Mexican journalists apparently selected as candidates for surveillance over a two-year period.\nThe consortium’s analysis of the leaked data identified at least 10 governments believed to be NSO customers who were entering numbers into a system: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nAnalysis of the data suggests the NSO client country that selected the most numbers – more than 15,000 – was Mexico, where multiple different government agencies are known to have bought Pegasus. Both Morocco and the UAE selected more than 10,000 numbers, according to the analysis suggested.\nThe phone numbers which were selected, possibly ahead of a surveillance attack, spanned more than 45 countries across four continents. There were more than 1,000 numbers in European countries that, the analysis indicated, were selected by NSO clients.\nInteractive graphic: Niko Kommenda and Ashley Kirk\nWithout forensic examination of mobile devices, it is impossible to say whether phones were subjected to an attempted or successful hack using Pegasus.\nNSO has always maintained it “does not operate the systems that it sells to vetted government customers, and does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets”.\nIn statements issued through its lawyers, NSO denied “false claims” made about the activities of its clients, but said it would “continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action”. It said the list could not be a list of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”, and described the 50,000 figure as “exaggerated”.\nThe company sells only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies in 40 unnamed countries, and says it rigorously vets its customers’ human rights records before allowing them to use its spy tools.\nThe Israeli minister of defence closely regulates NSO, granting individual export licences before its surveillance technology can be sold to a new country.\nLast month, NSO released a transparency report in which it claimed to have an industry-leading approach to human rights and published excerpts from contracts with customers stipulating they must only use its products for criminal and national security investigations.\nThere is nothing to suggest NSO’s customers did not also use Pegasus in terrorism and crime investigations, and the consortium also found numbers in the data belonging to suspected criminals.\nHowever, the broad array of numbers in the list belonging to people who seemingly have no connection to criminality suggests some NSO clients are breaching their contracts with the company, spying on pro-democracy activists and journalists investigating corruption, as well as political opponents and government critics.\nThat thesis is supported by forensic analysis on the phones of a small sample of journalists, human rights activists and lawyers whose numbers appeared on the leaked list. The research, conducted by Amnesty’s Security Lab, a technical partner on the Pegasus project, found traces of Pegasus activity on 37 out of the 67 phones examined.\nQ&A\nWhat is the Pegasus project?\nShow\nThe analysis also uncovered some sequential correlations between the time and date a number was entered into the list and the onset of Pegasus activity on the device, which in some cases occurred just a few seconds later.\nAmnesty shared its forensic work on four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer-review of Amnesty’s forensic methods, and found them to be sound.\nThe presence of a number in the data does not mean there was an attempt to infect the phone. NSO says there were other possible purposes for numbers being recorded on the list.\nRwanda, Morocco, India and Hungary denied having used Pegasus to hack the phones of the individuals named in the list. The governments of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, the UAE and Dubai did not respond to invitations to comment.\nThe Pegasus project is likely to spur debates over government surveillance in several countries suspected of using the technology. The investigation suggests the Hungarian government of Viktor Orbán appears to have deployed NSO’s technology as part of his so-called war on the media, targeting investigative journalists in the country as well as the close circle of one of Hungary’s few independent media executives.\nThe leaked data and forensic analyses also suggest NSO’s spy tool was used by Saudi Arabia and its close ally, the UAE, to target the phones of close associates of the murdered Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the months after his death. The Turkish prosecutor investigating his death was also a candidate for targeting, the data leak suggests.\nClaudio Guarnieri, who runs Amnesty International’s Security Lab, said once a phone was infected with Pegasus, a client of NSO could in effect take control of a phone, enabling them to extract a person’s messages, calls, photos and emails, secretly activate cameras or microphones, and read the contents of encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal.\nBy accessing GPS and hardware sensors in the phone, he added, NSO’s clients could also secure a log of a person’s past movements and track their location in real time with pinpoint accuracy, for example by establishing the direction and speed a car was travelling in.\nViktor Orbán using NSO spyware in assault on media, data suggests\nRead more\nThe latest advances in NSO’s technology enable it to penetrate phones with “zero-click” attacks, meaning a user does not even need to click on a malicious link for their phone to be infected.\nGuarnieri has identified evidence NSO has been exploiting vulnerabilities associated with iMessage, which comes installed on all iPhones, and has been able to penetrate even the most up-to-date iPhone running the latest version of iOS. His team’s forensic analysis discovered successful and attempted Pegasus infections of phones as recently as this month.\nApple said: “Security researchers agree iPhone is the safest, most secure consumer mobile device on the market.”\nNSO declined to give specific details about its customers and the people they target.\nHowever, a source familiar with the matter said the average number of annual targets per customer was 112. The source said the company had 45 customers for its Pegasus spyware.\nAdditional reporting: Dan Sabbagh in London, Shaun Walker in Budapest, Angelique Chrisafis in Paris and Martin Hodgson in New York.\nShow your support for the Guardian’s fearless investigative journalism today so we can keep chasing the truth","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to the topic of a data leak related to cyber-surveillance and hacking software.

The watchdog said a “significant” number of the users were from the EU.\nIn addition to the fine, it “imposed a reprimand and an order” requiring Meta to “bring its processing into compliance by taking a range of specified remedial actions within a particular timeframe”.\nIn a statement Meta said: “We made changes to our systems during the time in question, including removing the ability to scrape our features in this way using phone numbers. Unauthorised data scraping is unacceptable and against our rules.”\nThe punishment brings the total amount of fines imposed on Meta by the DPC to nearly €1bn since September last year. In September Meta was fined €405m for letting teenagers set up Instagram accounts that publicly displayed their phone numbers and email addresses, while in March the watchdog fined Meta €17m for further GDPR breaches and in September last year it fined Meta’s WhatsApp €225m over “severe” and “serious” infringements of GDPR.\nHowever, one legal expert questioned whether strong enforcement of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation would have the deterrent effect that it intended.\n“By any measure, these are significant fines,” said David Hackett, head of data protection in the Ireland office of law firm Addleshaw Goddard. “GDPR envisaged the imposition of such fines in part to serve as a deterrent to other companies which might consider breaching the law. We are likely to see increased debate about whether such fines actually influence corporate behaviour or if some companies simply see them as an added cost of doing business.”\nThe DPC regulates Apple, Google, TikTok and other technology platforms owing to the location of their EU headquarters in Ireland.

The next day the company announced it had restored systems and said it was “still responding” to the incident.\nThe situation developed on Wednesday when Medibank disclosed to the Australian stock exchange that hackers had contacted the company to “negotiate” over the future of 200 gigabytes of customer data they said had been stolen from company systems.\nAlthough Medibank initially claimed there was “no evidence that customer data has been accessed”, the public learned the scale of the breach on Thursday as the Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian federal police started to investigate.\nHow did the attack occur?\nMedibank is understood to still be investigating but it is thought someone gained access using fake or compromised user credentials.\nWhat do we know about what was taken?\nThe hacker shared a sample of 100 policies for verification. This information contained names, addresses, dates of birth, Medicare numbers, phone numbers and medical claims data – including information about diagnoses, procedures and the location of medical services.\nIn a statement the insurer said the hacker also claimed to hold credit card information, but this has not been confirmed. The sample is believed to come from ahm and contain information about international students who were policyholders.\nHow many people does it affect?\nMedibank has about 4 million customers but it is not known at this stage how many were caught in the breach.\nWho is at risk?\nSo far it has been confirmed international students have been affected, since private health insurance is a requirement when they come to study in Australia. This is concerning as many students have moved from countries where their medical information could be used against them.\nAnyone who holds a policy with Medibank should be on notice.

And what it means is that we need to do a lot better as a country to make sure that we are doing everything we can within organisations to protect customer data, and also for citizens to be doing everything that they can.”\nO’Neil said the Medibank and Optus breaches amounted to a “huge wake-up call” that showed the need for an overhaul of information and privacy protections.\nWhat can you do if you’re affected?\nIt is difficult for an individual person to respond to a data breach of this size and scale. Criminals will typically use this information to take out fake loans or use credit card information to make purchases. To manage this risk people can contact Equifax for credit monitoring and replace credit cards.\nOther risks can be managed by reviewing security settings on social media platforms, closing old and unused accounts and being careful about what is posted.

The whole world wanted to see it. This is what we were allowed to confidentially show people if they signed a non-disclosure agreement.”\nKaiser claims to be committed to human rights, but many would argue her career at Cambridge Analytica tells a different story. She has worked extensively for the firm, pitching business to clients in countries that have a history of exploitation by western political mercenaries, including Lithuania, Benin, Ethiopia and Libya.\nCambridge Analytica has a reputation among political operatives for exaggerating its role in campaigns. A senior Trump campaign official who said they saw the document about a year ago claimed it took credit for some work that was done by the Republican national committee and Trump’s digital director, Brad Parscale.\nKaiser did not work on the campaign but said she gleaned information about how it was orchestrated during discussions with senior staff, including the now suspended chief executive, Alexander Nix.\nNone of the techniques described in the document are illegal. However, the scandal over Cambridge Analytica’s acquisition of data from more than 50 million Facebook users is lifting the lid on an industry that has learned how to closely track the online footprint and daily lives of US voters.\nDespite the advances made in data-led political campaigning, these were techniques that, according to the presentation, Trump did not have access to when Cambridge Analytica joined his campaign in early June 2016.\nThe Republican nominee, who had just secured sufficient delegates to become the party’s candidate, still had “no speakable data infrastructure” and “no unifying data, digital and tech strategy”, the document states.\nA sample of Cambridge Analytica’s ‘Trump for President’ debrief. Photograph: Cambridge Analytica\nPhotograph: Cambridge Analytica\nKaiser said Cambridge Analytica staff told her they were stunned when they arrived at Trump’s headquarters in Trump Tower, New York.\n“There was no database of record. There were many disparate data sources that were not connected, matched or hygiened,” she said of the process of ordering, sorting and cleaning enormous data sets. “There was no data science programme, so they weren’t undertaking any modelling. There was no digital marketing team.”\nOne of the first things Cambridge Analytica did, she said, was work with data supplied by the party’s data trust and other data acquired through an initiative called Project Alamo.\nThe document contains very little information about how the campaign used Facebook data. One page, however, suggests Cambridge Analytica was able to constantly monitor the effectiveness of its messaging on different types of voters, giving the company and the campaign constant feedback about levels of engagement on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.\nPhotograph: Cambridge Analytica\nThe feedback loop meant the algorithms could be constantly updated and improved to deliver thousands of different messages to voters depending on their profile.\nThe level of information the company could glean about voters – and the apparent appetite among Silicon Valley companies to cash in on the advertising bonanza – is illustrated on another page which shows how the Trump campaign used a prime piece of marketing real estate on election day: YouTube’s entire masthead.\nCambridge Analytica scandal: the biggest revelations so far\nRead more\nKaiser said Hillary Clinton’s campaign had reserved the space on Google’s video-hosting platform but was so confident of victory that it gave it up. “Google called us and said this ad space is now available, immediately,” Kaiser said. “That’s what I was told.”\nThe Trump campaign seized the opportunity, showing two different ads to different categories of voters according to the detailed geographical information of visitors to the YouTube home page.\nVoters in areas where people were likely to be Trump supporters were shown a triumphant-looking image of the nominee, and help finding their nearest polling station.\nThose whose geographical information suggested they were not fervent Trump supporters, such as swing voters, were shown photos of his high-profile supporters, including his daughter Ivanka Trump, a celebrity from the reality TV show Duck Dynasty, and Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\nPhotograph: Cambridge Analytica\nOne of the most effective ads, according to Kaiser, was a piece of native advertising on the political news website Politico, which was also profiled in the presentation. The interactive graphic, which looked like a piece of journalism and purported to list “10 inconvenient truths about the Clinton Foundation”, appeared for several weeks to people from a list of key swing states when they visited the site. It was produced by the in-house Politico team that creates sponsored content.\nThe Cambridge Analytica presentation dedicates an entire slide to the ad, which is described as having achieved “an average engagement time of four minutes”. Kaiser described the ad as “the most successful thing we pushed out”.\nPolitico said editorial journalists were not involved in the campaign, and similar ads were purchased by the Bernie Sanders and Clinton campaigns.\nAdvertisements on Facebook, Twitter, Google and the music-sharing app Pandora were used to help convince 35,000 supporters to install an app used by the most active supporters.\nAccording to the presentation, Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign also used a new advertising technique offered by Twitter, launched at the start of the election year, which enabled clients to kickstart viral tweets.\nThe “conversational ads” feature was used to encourage Trump’s followers to tweet using a set of pre-determined hashtags.\nThe campaign also took advantage of an ad opportunity provided by Snapchat, enabling users to swipe up and immediately see a preloaded web page. While not useful for securing donors, Cambridge Analytica deemed the tool useful for engaging potential voter “contacts”, according to the presentation.\nOne of the final slides explains how the company used paid-for Google ads to implement “persuasion search advertising”, to push pro-Trump and anti-Clinton search results through the company’s main search facility.\nPhotograph: Cambridge Analytica\nOne slide showed how the company ensured that voters searching the words “Trump Iraq War” would encounter paid-for search results that were favourable to his campaign. “Control The First Impression,” the slide says, with an arrow pointing to a search result that states: “Hillary Voted for the Iraq War – Donald Trump opposed it.”\n“That’s a Google manipulation thing,” Kaiser said, adding that while a “general person” probably did not know how easy it was to pay for ads to appear high in Google search results, it was considered “an old-school tactic” in her industry.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of data leak related to Cambridge Analytica's techniques used during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

The government bears responsibility for the public health consequences.”\nA DPIA is required before carrying out any “high risk” processing of personal data. The government had previously argued that the test-and-trace programmes, which involves carrying detailed personal information from patients across the country, did not qualify as high risk, until the ORG threatened to take it to court over the claim.\n“These legal requirements are more than just a tick-box compliance exercise,” said Ravi Naik, the legal director of the data rights agency AWO, which took the action on behalf of the ORG. “They ensure that risks are mitigated before processing occurs, to preserve the integrity of the system. Instead, we have a rushed-out system, seemingly compromised by unsafe processing practices.”\nA DHSC spokesperson told the Guardian that the department had “undertaken a number of separate DPIAs covering the constituent parts of the NHS Test and Trace service” and that an “overarching DPIA” was “in development”.\n“An entire industry has been successfully set up at speed to tackle the most serious public health crisis we have faced in a century,” the spokesperson added. Our priority has been to save lives and protect public health and we will not apologise for doing so. NHS Test and Trace is committed to the highest ethical and data governance standards and there is no evidence of data being used unlawfully.”\nAccording to a freedom of information request filed by the Guardian, the test-and-trace programme has already experienced three data breaches involving personal data. In two, Serco, a private company contracted to run the programme, was looking to recruit contact tracers and accidentally sent out group emails using the “cc” function, exposing the contact details of its subcontractors. One of these was reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office, but the second was judged a “minor breach” and left unreported.\nIn a third, Ventrica, another private company, failed to properly redact the name and number of a contact of someone with a positive Covid-19 test result from a training video. This too was unreported.\nIn June, the Department of Health and Social Care made another concession to avoid a legal challenge, reducing the period of time it would keep personal data from 20 years to eight. But the privacy notice for the programme still claims it is necessary to keep personal data of people with symptoms for two decades, since “Covid-19 is a new disease and it may be necessary to know who has been infected, or been in close contact with someone with symptoms, to help control any future outbreaks or to provide any new treatments”.\nIn an effort to prevent the government making up the rules as it goes along, senior politicians have called on ministers to introduce legislation governing what the test-and-trace programme can and cannot focus on.\n“It seems to us absolutely evident that the bill is needed,” Harriet Harman, the chair of the influential joint committee on human rights, said in June. “And instead of looking ahead to that fact, they’re going to wait until it’s urgent. Public opinion is very volatile about this sort of thing.

Experts disagree","Content":"After information from 533 million Facebook users was exposed to hackers, the company has tried to reassure users, saying that the data was leaked years ago and has since been secured.\nBut experts say the issue is still grave – whether it happened in 2021 or years prior – largely because of the nature of the leaked data.\nThe dataset, first reported by Business Insider, contained information from 106 countries including phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates and email addresses.\nEven if it did not include passwords, the data is significant because those identifiers don’t often change, said Rob Shavell, chief executive officer of DeleteMe, a personal data protection tool.\n“Even if the data is old, it’s never really old because it will always be useful for data brokers,” he said. “It helps them correlate related information that is new and dump them into these profiles, which they sell online for as little as 99 cents.”\nThat the leak dates back to 2019 may actually work to Facebook’s detriment: under some privacy regulations, including Europe’s GDPR, that means the company should have alerted users under privacy-related reporting requirements. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission announced on Tuesday it was investigating the breach to see if it violated any rules.\n“The DPC attempted over the weekend to establish the full facts and is continuing to do so,” it said in a statement. “It received no proactive communication from Facebook.”\nFacebook data leak: details from 533 million users found on website for hackers\nRead more\nThe data probably changed hands many times, said Ivan Righi, cyberthreat intelligence analyst at the San Francisco cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows. He said it appeared the data had initially been listed at a relatively steep price, limiting the number of hackers who were willing to buy.\n“The breach was probably resold multiple times since then until the price lowered enough that a user decided to publicly expose it to generate a small profit and increase reputation,” he said, adding that this behavior was common for hackers. “While the data may be old, it still holds a lot of value to cybercriminals.”\nData leaked from Facebook can be used in combination with existing user data online to hack accounts, including bank and other accounts that require two-factor authentication – texting a confirmation code to a phone number to verify a person’s identity. The leaking of phone numbers can also be problematic amid the meteoric rise of robocalls in recent years.\n“Forget about being hacked, it’s just annoying to be constantly getting spam calls,” Shavell said. “The data breach, whether they say it’s old or not, is another way spammers get this information.”\nThe latest breach adds fuel to the antitrust fight that has been brewing in Washington. Facebook has experienced data security issues in the past, most notably when the political firm Cambridge Analytica accessed information of up to 87 million users without their knowledge.\nThe new breach also calls attention to the need for additional regulations in the EU, said Varoon Bashyakarla, a data scientist who works as a technical adviser to the Real Facebook Oversight Board – an activist group intended to hold Facebook accountable for content decisions. Bashyakarla said his own data had been exposed in the breach.\n“This incident underscores the need for Facebook to respond to European regulators and not merely American ones,” he said. “If there are no consequences for incidents like this one, they will continue, as we’ve observed over the last several years.”\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which called the newly revealed breach “horrific”, said Facebook’s dominance in the tech industry directly contributed to hacks like these. There are few options for users who, fed up with privacy breaches, do not want to use the platform – Facebook already owns alternatives including Instagram and WhatsApp.\n“Privacy does not come from monopoly,” Cory Doctorow of EFF said. “Facebook’s data breach problems are the inevitable result of monopoly, in particular the knowledge that it can heap endless abuses on its users and retain them.”\nFacebook did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nUsers can check legitimate websites including HaveIBeenPwned to see if their data is included in the leak, or in leaks past.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to the topic of data leaks, but it is not specifically related to a navigation system data leak.

Deloitte’s internal review into the incident is ongoing.\nThe Guardian understands Deloitte discovered the hack in March this year, but it is believed the attackers may have had access to its systems since October or November 2016.\nThe hacker compromised the firm’s global email server through an “administrator’s account” that, in theory, gave them privileged, unrestricted “access to all areas”.\nThe account required only a single password and did not have “two-step“ verification, sources said.\nEmails to and from Deloitte’s 244,000 staff were stored in the Azure cloud service, which was provided by Microsoft. This is Microsoft’s equivalent to Amazon Web Service and Google’s Cloud Platform.\nMicrosoft’s Azure cloud service. Photograph: Microsoft\nIn addition to emails, the Guardian understands the hackers had potential access to usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information. Some emails had attachments with sensitive security and design details.\nThe breach is believed to have been US-focused and was regarded as so sensitive that only a handful of Deloitte’s most senior partners and lawyers were informed.\nThe Guardian has been told the internal inquiry into how this happened has been codenamed “Windham”. It has involved specialists trying to map out exactly where the hackers went by analysing the electronic trail of the searches that were made.\nThe team investigating the hack is understood to have been working out of the firm’s offices in Rosslyn, Virginia, where analysts have been reviewing potentially compromised documents for six months.\nIt has yet to establish whether a lone wolf, business rivals or state-sponsored hackers were responsible.\nContact the Guardian securely\nRead more\nSources said if the hackers had been unable to cover their tracks, it should be possible to see where they went and what they compromised by regenerating their queries. This kind of reverse-engineering is not foolproof, however.\nA measure of Deloitte’s concern came on 27 April when it hired the US law firm Hogan Lovells on “special assignment” to review what it called “a possible cybersecurity incident”.\nThe Washington-based firm has been retained to provide “legal advice and assistance to Deloitte LLP, the Deloitte Central Entities and other Deloitte Entities” about the potential fallout from the hack.\nResponding to questions from the Guardian, Deloitte confirmed it had been the victim of a hack but insisted only a small number of its clients had been “impacted”. It would not be drawn on how many of its clients had data made potentially vulnerable by the breach.\nThe Guardian was told an estimated 5m emails were in the ”cloud” and could have been been accessed by the hackers. Deloitte said the number of emails that were at risk was a fraction of this number but declined to elaborate.\n“In response to a cyber incident, Deloitte implemented its comprehensive security protocol and began an intensive and thorough review including mobilising a team of cybersecurity and confidentiality experts inside and outside of Deloitte,” a spokesman said.\n“As part of the review, Deloitte has been in contact with the very few clients impacted and notified governmental authorities and regulators.\n“The review has enabled us to understand what information was at risk and what the hacker actually did, and demonstrated that no disruption has occurred to client businesses, to Deloitte’s ability to continue to serve clients, or to consumers.\n“We remain deeply committed to ensuring that our cybersecurity defences are best in class, to investing heavily in protecting confidential information and to continually reviewing and enhancing cybersecurity. We will continue to evaluate this matter and take additional steps as required.\n“Our review enabled us to determine what the hacker did and what information was at risk as a result. That amount is a very small fraction of the amount that has been suggested.”\nDeloitte declined to say which government authorities and regulators it had informed, or when, or whether it had contacted law enforcement agencies.\nThough all major companies are targeted by hackers, the breach is a deep embarrassment for Deloitte, which offers potential clients advice on how to manage the risks posed by sophisticated cybersecurity attacks.\n“Cyber risk is more than a technology or security issue, it is a business risk,” Deloitte tells potential customers on its website.\n“While today’s fast-paced innovation enables strategic advantage, it also exposes businesses to potential cyber-attack. Embedding best practice cyber behaviours help our clients to minimise the impact on business.”\nDeloitte has a “CyberIntelligence Centre” to provide clients with “round-the-clock business focussed operational security”.\n“We monitor and assess the threats specific to your organisation, enabling you to swiftly and effectively mitigate risk and strengthen your cyber resilience,” its website says. “Going beyond the technical feeds, our professionals are able to contextualise the relevant threats, helping determine the risk to your business, your customers and your stakeholders.”\nIn 2012, Deloitte, which has offices all over the world, was ranked the best cybersecurity consultant in the world.\nEarlier this month, Equifax, the US credit monitoring agency, admitted the personal data of 143 million US customers had been accessed or stolen in a massive hack in May. It has also revealed it was also the victim of an earlier breach in March.\nAbout 400,000 people in the UK may have had their information stolen following the cybersecurity breach. The US company said an investigation had revealed that a file containing UK consumer information “may potentially have been accessed”.\nThe data includes names, dates of birth, email addresses and telephone numbers, but does not contain postal addresses, passwords or financial information. Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, discovered the hack in July but only informed consumers last week.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a cybersecurity breach at Deloitte, one of the world's major accountancy firms.

All of those people had applied for a permit to carry a concealed gun.\nLeak of California gun owners’ private data far wider than originally reported\nRead more\nThe data was exposed just days after the US supreme court ruled that people have a right to carry guns in public. The decision invalidated a California law that said people must give a reason for wanting to carry a concealed weapon, such as a threat to their safety. Lawmakers then tried to pass new restrictions for concealed carry permits, but failed.\nInvestigators said they “did not uncover any evidence that the timing of the (data breach) was driven by a nefarious intent or was personally or politically motivated in any way”. Instead, they said state officials planned to publish what they thought was anonymous data “to meet anticipated heightened public interest in firearms-related data” following the court ruling.\nAn intentional breach of personal information carries more stiff fines and penalties under California law, according to Chuck Michel, an attorney and president of the California Rifle & Pistol Association. He said the association is preparing a lawsuit against the state and is encouraging people impacted by the exposure to talk with an attorney about filing their own lawsuits.\nMichel noted the leaked data likely included information from people in sensitive positions – including judges, law enforcement personnel and domestic violence victims – who had sought gun permits.\n“There are a lot of gaps and unanswered questions, perhaps deliberately so, and some spin on this whole notion of whether this was an intentional release or not,” he said. “This is not the end of the inquiry.”\nThe department of justice contracted with the Morrison Foerster law firm to investigate the data exposure. The firm said it had “the mandate and autonomy to conduct an independent investigation that followed the facts and evidence wherever they led”.\nOfficials at the California department of justice did not know about the breach until someone sent attorney general Rob Bonta a private message on Twitter that included screenshots of the personal information that was available to download from the state’s website, the investigation said.\nState officials at first thought the report was a hoax. Two unnamed employees – identified only as “Data Analyst 1” and “Research Center Director” – investigated and mistakenly assured everyone that no personal information was publicly available.\nMeanwhile, the website crashed because so many people were trying to download the data. Another group of state officials worked to bring the website back online, unaware of the breach. They got the website working again at about 9.30pm.\nState officials would not disable the website until about noon the next day. By then, the information had already been downloaded thousands of times.\nState officials thought they were providing anonymous information in the aggregate for research and media requests about the use of guns in California. But the employee who created the website included several datasets that contained personal information.\nInvestigators found that no one – neither the employee who compiled the data nor the officials that supervised the employee – knew the proper security settings to prevent the data from being available for public download.\n“This was more than an exposure of data, it was a breach of trust that falls far short of my expectations and the expectations Californians have of our department,” Bonta, the attorney general, said in a news release. “I remain deeply angered that this incident occurred and extend my deepest apologies on behalf of the department of justice to those who were affected.”\nOther information was also mistakenly released, including data from firearms safety certificates, dealer record of sale and the state’s assault weapons registry. That data included dates of birth, gender and driver’s license numbers for more than 2 million people and 8.7m gun transactions. But investigators said there wasn’t enough information in those datasets to identify anyone.\nInvestigators recommended more training and planning for state officials, including a review and update of policies and procedures.\n“This failure requires immediate correction, which is why we are implementing all of the recommendations from this independent report,” Bonta said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about a data leak involving California gun owners.

The firm’s class actions senior associate, Ben Zocco, said the breach was “potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history”.\nThe company announced on Monday afternoon that a 12-month subscription to Equifax Protect credit monitoring would be offered to all affected customers, and customers could expect to receive an email about how to start the service in the coming days.\nOptus cyber-attack could involve customers dating back to 2017\nRead more\nSuch services keep track of changes to a person’s credit history and watch for any suspicious activity.\nO’Neil told parliament “the breach is of a nature that we should not expect to see in a large telecommunications provider in this country” and that she had asked the chief executive of Optus for credit monitoring services to be provided for affected customers.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nO’Neil said the breach raised substantial policy issues, and flagged the potential for new laws with large fines for such breaches.\n“One significant question is whether the cybersecurity requirements we place on large telecommunications providers in this country are fit for purpose. I also note that in other jurisdictions, a data breach of this size will result in fines amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars,” she said.\nThe minister did not refer to the incident as a cyber-attack. Reports on how the personal information was accessed have thrown into question the company’s claim that it was as a result of a “sophisticated attack”.\nA user going by the name “optusdata” has posted on a data-leak site claiming they had obtained the data, and had offered to sell it back to Optus for $1m in cryptocurrency in the next week. The user posted a sample of the data, including 100 records. Multiple reports have suggested that these records are legitimate Optus user data.\nThe cybersecurity journalist Jeremy Kirk reported that the user claimed they obtained the data not through a sophisticated attack on the company’s systems but through an application programming interface (API) connecting Optus’s customer database.\nAn API is used to allow systems to transfer data. When left open on the internet without requiring authorisation, it is not difficult for people to gain access to the data.\nWhen contacted by Guardian Australian on the data leak forum, the user claimed this was how they found and extracted the data from Optus. The API is now offline.\nThe Australian Federal Police announced on Monday officers were working with overseas law enforcement to identify who was behind the attack.\n“Criminals, who use pseudonyms and anonymising technology, can’t see us but I can tell you that we can see them,” assistant commissioner Justine Gough said.\nSign up to Morning Mail\nFree daily newsletter\nOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But no one’s picked up the phone and called us, so to speak,” she said. “I cannot actually validate whether that’s even legitimate. And part of that is, again, it’s under investigation.”\nThe data-leak forum user told Guardian Australia on Monday they had not yet had contact with Optus. They claimed they were not interested in the attention the breach had brought, and “just want money, like everyone”.\nA long-awaited review of Australia’s privacy law was also expected to be finalised before the end of this year. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said his department was working though “the many submissions and feedback” to produce a final report that will be made public once the government had considered it.\nOptus’s chief information security officer left the company in August after four years in the role, ITNews reported.

Public disclosures of security breaches are required by law in many US states, with most regulations mandating that the notification be made “in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay”.\nUber’s revelations sparked several federal and state inquiries. In September 2018, Uber paid $148m (£130m) to settle claims by all 50 US states and Washington DC that it was too slow to disclose the hacking. The two hackers involved in the year pleaded guilty to hacking Uber and then extorting Uber’s “bug bounty” security research program the following year.\nThe justice department filed criminal charges against Sullivan in 2020. At the time, prosecutors alleged he arranged to pay the hackers $100,000 (£87,964) in bitcoin and had them sign nondisclosure agreements that falsely stated they had not stolen data.\nSullivan was also accused of withholding information from Uber officials who could have disclosed the breach to the FTC, which had been evaluating the San Francisco-based company’s data security following a 2014 breach.\nIn July, Uber accepted responsibility for covering up the breach and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution of Sullivan over his alleged role in concealing the hacking, as part of a settlement with US prosecutors to avoid criminal charges.\nAn FTC spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday: “The court’s decision affirms that hiding serious breaches of data from the FTC will not be tolerated and makes clear that big tech executives are not above the law.” Sullivan’s lawyer David Angeli did not respond to a request for comment.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the JSON format response based on the provided news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a navigation system data leak because it discusses a cybersecurity incident involving the former Uber security chief, Joe Sullivan.

{"num":52,"Time":"DECEMBER 23, 2013","Title":"RPT-SPECIAL REPORT-In satellite tech race, China hitched a ride from Europe","Content":"By David Lague\nHONG KONG, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Chinese leader Xi Jinping has exhorted the People’s Liberation Army “to get ready to fight and win wars” and “to win regional warfare under information technology-oriented conditions.”\nFor now, China’s sprawling defense industries and research laboratories are relying on a high-tech short cut. In a vast and carefully coordinated effort, China is scouring the globe for know-how that can be coupled with domestic innovation to produce strategic weapons and equipment.\nA year ago this month, technicians at a maker of satellite navigation gear in the Belgian town of Leuven worked over the year-end holidays to test one such breakthrough. The Belgians loaded their receivers with a technical code for a new satellite-navigation system called Beidou, or Big Dipper.\nThe signal from the new Chinese system provided a surprisingly accurate position fix. “It was certainly better than you would expect from somebody doing this for the first time,” says Jan Van Hees, sales manager for privately owned Septentrio, which plans to sell civilian equipment that can use Beidou’s signal.\nIt wasn’t beginner’s luck, though. China had help - and it came from European Union headquarters in Brussels, just down the road from Leuven.\nKnow-how for the Beidou Navigation System, according to interviews with European researchers, a review of diplomatic cables and articles from military and technical journals, came from a technology partnership between Beijing and the European Union. The Chinese essentially piggybacked on a European satellite-navigation initiative, called Galileo, that was meant to rival two existing networks: the dominant Global Positioning System of the United States, or GPS, and Russia’s GLONASS.\nSixteen Beidou satellites are now in orbit, with the network scheduled to expand to 30 when fully deployed by 2020. Europe’s Galileo is expected to become operational only next year with 18 satellites. When fully deployed by 2020, the EU constellation will also have 30 satellites.\nSenior Chinese military officers have said Beidou is more important to China than manned space flight or the Chinese lunar probes now under way, according to reports in the state-run media. The successful deployment of Beidou means the increasingly potent Chinese armed forces will have an accurate, independent navigation system - vital technology for guiding the missiles, warships and attack aircraft that allow Beijing to claim great power status.\nBeidou is one of the most striking examples of China’s global quest to buy, copy or steal the technology it needs to close the gap with the United States and other leading military powers. Highly accurate satellite navigation is fundamental to modern warfare. Aerospace experts say European and U.S. know-how and equipment have been indispensable for China to design, build, launch, position, test and operate its navigation network and other satellites.\n“The Chinese know exactly what they want and very often know exactly where to find it,” says Oliver Brauner, a researcher on China’s arms trade at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s China and Global Security Project.\nBeidou isn’t only about national defense. Beijing sees it as a commercial coup for China’s fast growing market satellite navigation services for cars, mobile phones and other applications. Belgium’s Septentrio and other Western and Chinese companies hope to capitalize by making compatible gear for sale in China and abroad.\nThe Chinese cabinet on Thursday approved a blueprint that envisioned Beidou capturing 60 percent of a projected 400 billion yuan ($65 billion) market for satellite navigation services in China, according to the English language China Daily. But the report also said that 40 percent of Beidou’s satellite applications would be for military use.\nThe system is a triumph for the Chinese military-industrial complex. Despite an arms embargo that’s been in place since the bloody 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, the People’s Liberation Army continues to secure much of the military or dual-use technology it needs from the United States and the European Union.\nTHE 863 PLAN\nSome Chinese researchers play down the role of European technology in the Chinese network. The EU-Chinese satellite collaboration broke down before the partnership ran its course, they note, and they say one of the reasons was that Europe was withholding key technologies.\n“China was regarded as a funds provider rather than an equal collaborator” in the project, says Zhang Kefei, a professor and satellite navigation researcher at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and a former president of the International Association of Chinese Professionals in Global Positioning Systems. “They could not get any real benefit from the technology transfer.”\nThe Chinese Ministry of Defense said in a statement that China mainly relied on homegrown research, development and manufacturing for its military technology. “The Chinese people have the talent and capability to develop and make weapons needed for state security,” the ministry said. “History has proved that, and it remains the same now and will remain the same in the future.”\nBeidou fills an important hole for the People’s Liberation Army. China has invested heavily on a massive and expanding arsenal of missiles able to strike targets throughout East Asia, including U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea. Regular reports in China’s military journals and popular military press show Beidou receivers are now in use with infantry squads, amphibious landing vehicles, tanks and artillery, as the technology is adopted throughout the PLA.\nBefore Beidou, however, the Chinese military had to guide its hardware using civilian signals provided free by the foreign-run GPS or GLONASS. These services aren’t as accurate as specialized military signals - and can be selectively switched off. The United States openly warns it will jam the GPS signal to prevent “hostile use.” With Beidou, China can go it alone.\nA generation ago, the opening salvos of the first Gulf War demonstrated to a stunned Chinese military hierarchy how satellites gave the United States and its allies unchallenged knowledge and control of the battlefield. Armed with GPS navigation and data from surveillance and communications satellites, the U.S. coalition pulverized Iraq with smart and conventional weapons. The People’s Liberation Army was rapidly modernizing at the time, but it still had no capacity to match this overwhelming advantage.\nChina’s military research and development complex accelerated efforts to build a rival navigation network. Space technology was already a key element of Beijing’s “863 Plan.” The 863 directive - named after its March ‘86 launch date - came from Deng Xiaoping, architect of China’s modernization drive. Deng ordained the 863 campaign as one of China’s premier national R&D programs, with the goal of unifying military and civilian efforts to master strategic technologies.\nIn all of these measures to rebuild China through modern science and technology, the PLA has been a dominant player. Military thinking, goals and organization underpin the management of China’s sprawling network of research and development labs, according to experts on China’s space program. From the start, incorporating foreign technology has been a top priority for domestic satellite makers.\nAfter a series of expensive satellite launch failures in the 1980s and 1990s, China turned to some of America’s leading aerospace companies for technical help. This paid almost immediate dividends for China’s space and missile industry - but led to a backlash in Washington.\nA Congressional committee chaired by Californian Republican Chris Cox probed the transfers of sensitive U.S. technology to China. In 1999, the Cox Report found that the United States, Germany and France had provided significant support to China’s satellite programs.\nIn the aftermath of the report, U.S. aerospace companies Loral Space and Communications Ltd, Hughes Electronics Corp, and Lockheed Martin Corp were fined for providing technical aid to the Chinese satellite program. Lockheed Martin said that U.S. government licenses specifically allowed the transaction with the Chinese entities involved. Loral and Hughes denied they harmed American security in doing business in China.\nWashington went on to restrict foreign access to satellite technology. From 1999, this effectively banned the export, re-export or transfer of this equipment or know-how to China. The launch of U.S. satellites from Chinese territory was also prohibited.\nGALILEO PARTNERSHIP\nBlocked in America, China turned to Europe. European space companies had been collaborating with China through the 1990s. But tech transfers increased sharply when China in 2003 pledged to contribute 200 million euros ($228 million at the time) to join the European Union’s Galileo satellite navigation program.\nGalileo was running years behind schedule. Brussels enthusiastically embraced China’s involvement. European space contractors saw cooperation as an opportunity to expand access to the Chinese market while U.S. companies were effectively shut out, industry experts said.\nFrom late 2004, the two sides signed 12 contracts, under which China would deliver key technologies for Galileo’s early development, according to EU and Chinese briefing documents and European Space Agency contract announcements.\nThe National Remote Sensing Centre of China oversaw these projects, which were to account for 33 million euros of China’s promised contribution to Galileo. The contracts also involved substantial European tech transfers, according to European space industry researchers.\nThe EU saw little risk. China’s space sector was seen as backward. The PLA was not deemed a security threat to Europe. China’s financial and political support to Galileo was also a welcome counter to U.S. opposition to the rival European network.\n“That made it easy to develop this kind of partnership with China,” says Nicola Casarini, security analyst at the European Union’s Institute for Security Studies in Paris. “The Europeans were genuine in believing that cooperation with China was mostly civilian.”\nBeijing set up a special company, China Galileo Industries, to coordinate the research and development. The shareholders are some of China’s top military aerospace companies. They include the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, a giant space contractor and missile designer and manufacturer, and the China Academy of Space Technology, a satellite and spacecraft maker.\nIt is unclear exactly how much European know-how was handed over. EU officials have been reluctant to discuss the transfers when questioned by participants at space industry seminars and conferences.\nThe European companies then involved in Galileo included the pan-European aerospace giant EADS and Thales SA of France, among others.\nEADS declined comment on previous co-operation with China and referred questions on the Galileo project to the European Commission. A spokesman for the commission declined to comment, as did China Galileo Industries. Thales didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nMaterials from a series of China Galileo Industries presentations at industry briefings in Europe and China after the deals were signed show the projects included a wide range of technology: development related to signals interference in the ionosphere; satellite positioning using lasers; measuring and predicting orbital paths; testing ground-based receivers; and search and rescue functions.\nTHE BREAKUP\nVirtually all of the budgeted funds were spent in China, and the Chinese contractors retained ownership of the resulting hardware and intellectual property, European space industry experts say. Still, tension mounted between the two sides.\nThe EU had always known China had plans to build a military navigation network. But it soon grew clear that China intended Beidou to compete with Galileo. The Europeans also came to realize that China was determined to extract as much dual-use technology as possible for its home-grown satellites. Brussels also grew frustrated at China’s plan to use frequencies for Beidou’s military service that could overlap with Galileo’s restricted signal for European government and military use.\nBeijing also grew unhappy. Squabbling between the EU’s many member states and companies over the funding and administration of Galileo caused indecision and delays. The EU network was supposed to enter service in 2008; this has now been pushed back to the end of next year at the earliest.\nAs China’s know-how expanded, U.S. diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks show, American diplomats and officials urged European governments and aerospace companies to withhold sensitive technology from China in the Galileo partnership.\nIn discussions with U.S. diplomats, senior EU officials explained how the Chinese had exploited their links with the European project, the cables show.\nAfter signing contracts, Chinese officials from the Ministry of Science and Technology made “shopping” visits to companies or research institutes across Europe using the agreements as authority for technology transfers, a senior EU official was quoted as saying in a 2009 cable from the U.S. embassy in Brussels. That cable also reported a senior EU official saying that “certain European-manufactured components have been transferred to China against the wishes” of the European Commission, the EU’s executive body. The cable did not say what those components were.\nA spokeswoman for the EU’s GNSS Agency, which oversees the Galileo project, referred questions about technology transfer to China and to the the European Commission, which runs the EU. The European Commission did not respond to requests for comment.\nATOMIC CLOCKS\nOne of China’s biggest coups was gaining access to atomic clocks, a key technology Beijing needed for accurate satellite navigation, according to aerospace experts and the leaked U.S. diplomatic cables.\nChina failed in attempts to buy these clocks from EADS, according to the leaked diplomatic cables. However, between 2003 and 2007, China bought up to 20 rubidium atomic clocks from the high-precision Swiss instrument maker Temex Time, now known as SpectraTime, according to industry experts and the diplomatic cables. Articles in Chinese technical journals suggest the Swiss clocks have been fitted to Beidou satellites.\nSpectraTime, a unit of Orolia Group, declined to answer questions for this article, referring a reporter to Swiss authorities. Orolia “is known to the Swiss export authorities as a manufacturer and exporter of controlled dual-use goods,” said Marie Avet, a spokeswoman for the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs, but she declined to comment on “specific transactions.”\nChinese companies now appear to have mastered the technology to build these clocks or reverse-engineered the Swiss versions.\nA March article carried by China’s state-owned China News Service reported that a research unit of state-owned China Aerospace Corp, the No. 203 Institute, began research and development on rubidium clocks in 2004. It has since successfully developed and built 10 of these clocks for Beidou satellites, the article said. “The rubidium atomic clock is the heart of a satellite navigation system,” the article said.\nBy 2010, Galileo had become a 100-percent taxpayer financed project and came under new rules governing security, technology and procurement. And the partnership with China was effectively dissolved. EU officials assured U.S. diplomats that no Chinese “technical staff will be working on the project and no staff of any type will be working in Brussels,” according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable.\nBy then, however, China was well advanced in a hectic launch schedule for its own network. All 16 satellites in the Beidou constellation have been fired into orbit since April 2007.\nThe Beidou Navigation System is now playing a crucial role in China’s military exercises, including the Mission Action 2013 military exercise that kicked off on Sept. 10, China’s Xinhua news agency reported this month. The system demonstrated a capability of covering PLA units fighting on multiple fronts simultaneously.\n“The era of China relying on a foreign satellite navigation system is in the past,” Xinhua said. “The era of China’s Beidou has arrived.”\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of Navigation system data leak.

By midday, the company’s share price losses had multiplied to more than $40bn, making the day its worst in more than five years.\nTheresa May’s spokesman said she backed an investigation by the information commissioner, which was prompted by a whistleblower who told the Observer how Cambridge Analytica had harvested millions of Facebook profiles to influence voters through “psychographic” targeting.\n00:03:41\nWhat is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer\nThe European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, said on Monday that the institution would investigate fully. Tajani urged the social media company to take more responsibility, saying on Twitter that “allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens’ privacy rights”.\nIn the US, a state attorney general has called for investigations, greater accountability and regulation, while the head of the parliamentary committee in the UK investigating fake news accused Cambridge Analytica and Facebook of misleading MPs, with the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport warning of an end to the “wild west” of technology firms.\nRevealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach\nRead more\n“The allegations are clearly very concerning. It’s essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way,” May’s spokesman said.\n“So it is absolutely right the information commissioner is investigating this matter and we expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organisations involved to cooperate fully.”\nIn a statement Facebook said: “We have hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford the firm complete access to their servers and systems. We remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information.”\nCambridge Analytica said: “In 2014 we received Facebook data and derivatives of Facebook data from another company, GSR, that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research. After it subsequently became known that GSR had broken its contract with Cambridge Analytica because it had not adhered to data protection regulation, Cambridge Analytica deleted all the Facebook data and derivatives, in cooperation with Facebook.\nThe culture secretary, Matt Hancock, told the House of Commons that the revelations were “clearly very worrying” and the government was considering additional powers that the commissioner had proposed, including powers to impose further criminal sanctions and to compel testimony from individuals. Hancock said he was shocked at the speed at which Facebook had barred the whistleblower, Chris Wylie, from its platforms, including WhatsApp.\n“I thought it was outrageous,” he said. “Facebook have some serious questions to answer here, and they will tell their side of the story. And to answer it by blocking an account, when we know in this house they do not act fast enough to block other accounts of obviously outrageous behaviour, I’ll tell you what, it shows that when they need to they can block things incredibly quickly and they will need to do a lot more that.”\nHowever, Hancock said he had not seen any evidence that the activities had had an effect on the outcome of any election or referendum.\nLabour’s Stephen Kinnock said that if Cambridge Analytica were proved to have been “in flagrant breach of our electoral rules, that would place a pretty huge question mark over the referendum result”.\nDamian Collins MP, who chairs the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would call the heads of both companies, Mark Zuckerberg and Alexander Nix, to give further testimony.\n“We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”\nCollins suggested the powers of the information commissioner should be beefed up to add the legal ability to force companies to provide information.\nDowning Street said it would consider any formal requests to give new powers to the commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, but added her powers had only recently been reviewed.\n“I haven’t seen any formal requests. The information commissioner does have significant powers, which have been enhanced in recent times, but if any formal requests were made to us I’m sure we’d consider it,” the spokesman said.\nHancock told Collins’s committee last week that following Brexit he would like to review legislation governing social media. On Monday the minister expanded on his words, telling the Telegraph that “the wild west for tech companies is over”.\nLast month both Facebook representatives and Nix had told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from Global Science Research (GSR). But in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix’s company.\nProfile\nAlexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica\nShow\n“In 2015 we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our ‘platform policies’ by passing data from an app that was using Facebook login to SCL\/Cambridge Analytica,” the statement said.\n00:13:04\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video\nFacebook and Cambridge Analytica face mounting pressure over data scandal\nRead more\nDonald Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign paid Cambridge Analytica more than $6.2m, according to US federal election commission records but is has denied using any Facebook data in the campaign.\nIn a now-deleted series of tweets, Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, argued that the friend list data that Cambridge Analytica had acquired was obtained through an API, a feature that allows programs to interface with Facebook, that was well documented “in our terms of service, platform documentation, the privacy settings and the screen used to login to apps”.On Saturday evening, however, he deleted his tweets, saying: “I should have done a better job weighing in.

{"num":62,"Time":"Wed 21 Jul 2021 14.31 CEST","Title":"Telegram founder listed in leaked Pegasus project data","Content":"Amid the varied cast of people whose numbers appear on a list of individuals selected by NSO Group’s client governments, one name stands out as particularly ironic. Pavel Durov, the enigmatic Russian-born tech billionaire who has built his reputation on creating an unhackable messaging app, finds his own number on the list.\nDurov, 36, is the founder of Telegram, which claims to have more than half a billion users. Telegram offers end-to-end encrypted messaging and users can also set up “channels” to disseminate information quickly to followers. It has found popularity among those keen to evade the snooping eyes of governments, whether they be criminals, terrorists or protesters battling authoritarian regimes.\nIn recent years, Durov has publicly rubbished the security standards of competitors, particularly WhatsApp, which he has claimed is “dangerous” to use. By contrast, he has positioned Telegram as a plucky upstart determined to safeguard the privacy of its users at all costs.\nQuick Guide\nWhat is in the Pegasus project data?\nShow\nWithout a forensic examination of Durov’s phone, it is not possible to say whether there was any attempt to install malware on the device.\nAn NSO source indicated Durov was not a target, meaning the source denies he was selected for surveillance using Pegasus, NSO’s spyware. The company insists that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative of whether that number was selected for surveillance using Pegasus.\nAsked directly whether Durov’s phone was a target of Pegasus or any other activity related to the spyware, an NSO spokesperson did not directly answer the question. They said: “Any claim that a name in the list is necessarily related to a Pegasus target or potential target is erroneous and false.” Lawyers for NSO said its decision not to respond to certain allegations should not be treated as confirmation of those claims.\nBut the list, which the Guardian and other media had access to as part of the Pegasus project, an international collaboration, is believed to be indicative of individuals identified as persons of interest by government clients of NSO. It includes people who were later targeted for surveillance, according to forensic analysis of their phones.\nCybersecurity experts who have examined how NSO’s Pegasus spyware works say the software does not discriminate between encrypted messaging apps and can access pretty much everything on an infected phone. They say Telegram, as well as WhatsApp, Signal and other messaging apps promising end-to-end encryption, are in effect rendered powerless if the device on which they are installed is infected by hacking software as powerful as Pegasus.\nDurov’s number, which appears on the list in early 2018, was the UK mobile number which has been linked to his personal Telegram account for years.\nNeither the publicity-averse Durov nor Telegram’s press office responded to requests for comment sent to their Telegram accounts.\nThe list of governments and intelligence services that might be happy to get a look at the contents of Durov’s mobile phone is long. Durov left Russia in 2013 and has had several conflicts with the country’s security services. Telegram has also played a key role in driving protest movements in Belarus, Hong Kong and Iran.\nHowever analysis of the leaked list suggests Durov might have been of interest to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nQ&A\nWhat is the Pegasus project?\nShow\nDurov has a passport from the Caribbean country of St Kitts and Nevis and has lived a peripatetic existence since leaving Russia. But papers filed at Companies House in London show that in February 2018 Durov changed his official residence from Finland to the UAE. The timing coincides with the appearance of Durov’s phone in the leaked data, and suggests it may have been a case of his hosts attempting to run checks on their controversial new resident.\nDespite an avowed disdain for the concept of nation states, Durov has cosied up to the rulers of his new home country since his move. In February this year, he met Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the crown prince of Dubai. “We continue to welcome great talent and ideas to Dubai, which offers a nurturing ecosystem for their development,” said Sheikh Hamdan after the meeting, according to a press release from Dubai authorities.\nThe UAE and Dubai did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations regarding Durov. The Guardian understands Dubai is a former client of NSO, but had its access to Pegasus terminated after an investigation into allegations of misuse.\nDurov only rarely makes public statements via his Telegram account, usually offering idiosyncratic lifestyle advice – always live alone, and eat a “seagan” diet of wild fish and nothing else, are two examples – or extolling the virtues of Telegram.\nSome have doubted Telegram’s self-portrayal as a devoted privacy advocate that will bow to no government, noting that Telegram chats are not end-to-end encrypted by default, only the app’s “secret chat” function. “I am inclined to advise people to avoid using Telegram entirely because there are alternatives that are end-to-end encrypted all the time,” said Eva Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nGalperin said it was important to note that end-to-end encryption still offered significant protection to the vast majority of users, many of whom, if they were targeted for surveillance at all, would probably be targeted by less advanced forms of surveillance than Pegasus.\nIn Belarus, where Telegram messages and channels have been driving revolutionary sentiment over the past year, authorities have had to resort to crude tactics to access the phones of activists – demanding arrested protesters unlock their phones and in May forcing a Ryanair plane transiting through Belarusian airspace with the administrator of a leading protest Telegram channel onboard to land in Minsk, where he was arrested.\n“According to all the information we have, without physical access to the device, the Belarusian authorities can’t get into our Telegram messages,” said the administrator of another Belarusian protest channel, speaking via a Telegram voice call.\nBut this equation changes dramatically when the authorities in question have access to Pegasus. Belarus is not known to be among NSO’s clients, and there is nothing to suggest that it is. But several other repressive regimes in countries where human rights activists and journalists regularly use encrypted messaging apps have bought Pegasus. Additionally, the disclosures by the Pegasus papers consortium this week suggest that in many countries a broad range of people, and sometimes their families or associates, can become targets of the spyware.\nSerguei Beloussov, a Singaporean tech entrepreneur who runs the data protection company Acronis, said software such as Pegasus made it hard to recommend particular messaging services as better than others. “Protecting a single application is not possible; the main vulnerability is your device,” he said. “The only fully secure device is one which is off.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, being listed in leaked Pegasus project data.

{"num":61,"Time":"Thu 22 Jul 2021 13.00 CEST","Title":"Dalai Lama’s inner circle listed in Pegasus project data","Content":"China’s nearest observation posts are hundreds of miles from Dharamsala, the city in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas that hosts Tibet’s government-in-exile and its highest spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. Still, Tibetans there have often felt closely watched.\nSuspected Chinese spies have regularly been detected in the hill station. A decade ago, a digital security specialist watched in disbelief as sensitive files on Tibetan government computers were extracted on the screen before his eyes – activity that led to the unearthing of a massive cyber-espionage network, known as GhostNet, which was largely traced to Chinese servers.\nSurveillance technology has evolved, and leaked data points to another possible interest in Tibetan communications – this time from a less obvious source.\nThe phone numbers of a top ring of advisers around the Dalai Lama are believed to have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group. Analysis strongly indicates that the Indian government was selecting the potential targets.\nQuick Guide\nWhat is in the Pegasus project data?\nShow\nOther phone numbers apparently selected by Delhi were those of the president of the government-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay, staff in the office of another Buddhist spiritual leader, the Gyalwang Karmapa, and several other activists and clerics who are part of the exiled community in India.\nNSO’s Pegasus spyware allows clients to infiltrate phones and extract their calls, messages and location. The selected Tibetans did not make their phones available to confirm whether any hacking was attempted or successful, but technical analysis of 10 other phones on the suspected Indian client list found traces of Pegasus or signs of targeting related to the spyware.\nTraces of Pegasus were found on 37 of the 67 phones in the data that were analysed by Amnesty International’s security lab. Of the 48 iPhones examined that had not been reset or replaced since they appeared in the records, 33 carried traces of Pegasus or signs of attempted infection. iPhones log the information that can reveal infection by the spyware.\nThe data may provide a glimpse at the delicate relationship between Tibet’s exiles and the Indian government, which has provided refuge for the movement since its leaders fled a Chinese crackdown in 1959, while also viewing it as leverage – and sometimes a liability – in its own relationship with Beijing.\nThe possible scrutiny of Tibetan spiritual and government leaders points to a growing awareness in Delhi, as well as in western capitals, of the strategic importance of Tibet as their relationships with China have grown more tense over the past five years.\nIt also highlights the growing urgency of the question of who will follow the current Dalai Lama, 86, a globally acclaimed figure whose death is likely to trigger a succession crisis that is already drawing in world powers. Last year the US made it a policy to impose sanctions against any government that interfered with the selection process.\nThe records suggest Tibetan leaders were first selected in late 2017, in the period before and after the former US president Barack Obama met the Dalai Lama privately on a foreign tour that also included earlier stops in China.\nSenior advisers to the Dalai Lama whose numbers appear in the data include Tempa Tsering, the spiritual leader’s long-time envoy to Delhi, and the senior aides Tenzin Taklha and Chhimey Rigzen, as well as Samdhong Rinpoche, the head of the trust that has been tasked with overseeing the selection of the Buddhist leader’s successor.\nTempa Tsering, right, the chief representative of the Dalai Lama in Delhi, speaks to the media alongside his wife, the Dalai Lama’s sister Jetsun Pema. Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno\/AFP\/Getty Images\nThe Dalai Lama, who has spent the past 18 months isolating in his compound in Dharamsala, is not known to carry a personal phone, according to two sources.\nFollowing the launch of the Pegasus project, India’s IT minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said the project’s claims about Indian surveillance were an “attempt to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”. He told parliament: “The presence of a number on the list does not amount to snooping ... there is no factual basis to suggest that use of the data somehow amounts to surveillance.”\nIndia could have several motives for possible spying on Tibetan leaders but some in Dharamsala have concluded the question of succession may be a driving force. Naming successors to the Dalai Lama has sometimes taken years after the death of the title holder, and is usually led by the monk’s senior disciples, who interpret signs that lead them to the child next in line.\nBut China views the next Dalai Lama as a potential separatist leader who could weaken its authoritarian grip on Tibet. It has claimed the sole right to control the selection process, and analysts say it is already pressuring neighbours such as Nepal and Mongolia to rule out recognising any successor but its own.\nA Buddhist monk walks near the temple of Tsuglagkhang, popularly known as the Dalai Lama temple, at sunset in McLeod Ganj, near Dharamsala. Photograph: Sanjay Baid\/EPA\nBeijing is also contacting influential Buddhist teachers and clerics around the world, including some based in India, inviting them to China to try to lay the groundwork for its choice and muddy support for any candidate chosen by the Dalai Lama’s followers.\nThese entreaties to Buddhist leaders and other interference in the succession process have been viewed warily by India’s security agencies, who may have sought to closely monitor an issue with huge implications for Delhi’s own relationship with China – but where its direct influence and control is limited.\n“India wants to make sure that Tibetans don’t strike a deal with the Chinese that involves the Dalai Lama going back to Tibet,” said a former staffer with the Tibetan administration, who asked not to be named.\nModi accused of treason by opposition over India spyware disclosures\nRead more\nIndia may also be seeking to monitor continuing informal contact between Chinese officials and Tibetan leaders. The Dalai Lama revealed two years ago that India had vetoed his plans to try to meet Xi Jinping when the Chinese president visited India in 2014.\n“The Dalai Lama himself has said several times that he maintains connections to the Chinese leadership through ‘old friends’,” the former Tibetan government staffer said. “India is very aware of this and they want to make sure that no deals are made without their knowing or involvement.”\nDelhi officially backs negotiations on the status of Tibet, but a recent Indian thinktank report suggested the country’s intelligence agencies had not always been supportive of the Dalai Lama’s “middle way”, a blueprint to resolve the dispute by recognising Chinese sovereignty over Tibet but granting the province meaningful autonomy.\nOther motives for possible monitoring of Tibetan leaders may be more straightforward, including that the Dalai Lama and the community around him are a magnet for sensitive information about Tibet and regularly meet dignitaries from around the world.\n“I would assume that India would pay close attention to, for example, western officials coming to Dharamsala – I think they’d want to monitor that in detail,” said Prof Robert Barnett, the former director of the Tibet studies programme at Columbia University. “Perhaps, is the Dalai Lama asking them for asylum? I think that kind of concern would matter a lot to them.”\nIn multiple statements, NSO said the fact a number appeared on the leaked list was in no way indicative of whether it was selected for surveillance using Pegasus. “The list is not a list of Pegasus targets or potential targets,” the company said. “The numbers in the list are not related to NSO Group in any way.\nQ&A\nWhat is the Pegasus project?\nShow\nThe Tibetan movement, like other stateless groups, is vulnerable to cyber-attacks but not entirely defenceless. The US government has for more than a decade funded digital security consultants to fortify Tibetan computer networks. Leaders are briefed that any of their devices could be breached at any time and they should act accordingly.\nTibetan leaders closely study security strategies pioneered for other exile and dissident groups, including flooding their phones and emails with confusing and contradictory information, which can tie up intelligence agencies as they try to sift truth from fiction. Other strategies include setting up “minefields”, servers and devices that appear genuine but are actually decoys that feed attackers false information and allow their hacking attempts to be studied.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system data leak.

Some 15 million people who used the company’s services, among them customers of cellular company T-Mobile who had applied for Experian credit checks, may have had their private information exposed, the company confirmed on Thursday.\nInformation from the hack includes names, addresses, and social security, driver’s license and passport numbers. The license and passport numbers were in an encrypted field, but Experian said that encryption may also have been compromised.\nConnecticut’s attorney general said he will launch an investigation into the breach.\nThe company said its consumer credit database was not affected and that “no other clients’ data was accessed”, presumably meaning the damage is limited to T-Mobile.\nExperian did not name the perpetrator but in a statement the company said it had contacted law enforcement. The hack specifically affects “those who applied for T-Mobile USA postpaid services or device financing from September 1, 2013 through September 16, 2015”, according to Experian.\n“Experian discovered an unauthorized party accessed T-Mobile data housed in an Experian server,” the company said in a questions page addressed to consumers. Experian is offering consumers affected by the breach free credit monitoring services.\nT-Mobile said it won’t delete credit check data from the Experian servers because of credit laws that require retention for 25 months.\n“Obviously I am incredibly angry about this data breach and we will institute a thorough review of our relationship with Experian, but right now my top concern and first focus is assisting any and all consumers affected,” wrote T-Mobile’s CEO, John Legere. “I take our customer and prospective customer privacy VERY [sic] seriously. This is no small issue for us. I do want to assure our customers that neither T-Mobile’s systems nor network were part of this intrusion and this did not involve any payment card numbers or bank account information.”\nExperian’s businesses extend into every area of American life, from customer loyalty cards that track the purchases of everyday necessities to public records including real estate liens and bankruptcy. Its vast database is widely used by automated advertising networks to load ads relevant to a given user, but has many other applications besides.\nJon Mandel, whose data firm PrecisionDemand was sold to AOL for an undisclosed sum last year, now works as a consultant in the industry and said that the breach has wide-ranging consequences across any number of industries. Data brokers, Mandel said, are often trusted by other companies to “anonymize” personally identifying information so as to keep it from accidentally leading to embarrassing mistakes such as the OfficeMax envelope addressed to “Mike Seay – Daughter Killed in Car Crash” (OfficeMax ultimately blamed an unidentified data broker for that incident).\n“The irony is that so many companies have used Experian as a ‘clean room’ to put your data together with other companies’ data to keep it from being personally identifiable,” Mandel said. “That very ability can make everything personally identifiable.”\nExperian has lobbied in support of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, legislation currently being considered in the Senate that would broaden its immunity were it to share its stores of information with the Department of Homeland Security (which in turn would be compelled to share it with law enforcement and the NSA). “Congress has the responsibility to balance the need for facilitating greater information sharing, and thereby enhancing cybersecurity, with important consumer privacy concerns,” an Experian spokesperson wrote last month. “We encourage and support Congress’s effort in striking this balance.”\nThe Experian hack is the most recent in a series of data breaches affecting organizations from the US government’s Office of Personnel Management to Target, often to the tune of tens of millions of users. The US government has blamed Chinese hackers for the OPM breach and pulled spies from the country because their cover stories could potentially have been blown by the breach.\nPrivate, identifying information is frequently reappropriated by data thieves, who have used it to wreak havoc among people from employees of multinational tech and entertainment company Sony and users of married hook-up site Ashley Madison, in the latter case leading to widespread blackmail.\nWith respect to this specific incident, Mandel said: “It’s like anything else in life. All kinds of things sound good but everything’s good in moderation. Sometimes the best medicine turns out to be poisonous.”\nThe latest incident is the second huge breach linked to Experian. An attack on an Experian subsidiary in 2014 exposed the social security numbers of 200 million Americans and prompted an investigation by at least four states, including Connecticut.\nA spokeswoman for Connecticut attorney general George Jepsen said on Thursday that it would investigate the latest attack.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to the Navigation system data leak because it discusses a data breach involving the exposure of personal information.

{"num":76,"Time":"Mon 3 Mar 2014 23.10 CET","Title":"Fears of patient data leak prompt inquiry into mapping website","Content":"A service offered by a data mapping website was closed down on Monday, as health authorities launched an investigation into the site amid concerns it had apparently acquired millions of identifiable patient records without regulatory scrutiny.\nA Hertfordshire-based online mapping company, Earthware, which offers services including property data, hosted a tool which could allow users to locate an area in England where a single individual had gone for specialised treatment.\nAlthough this would not necessarily pinpoint the patient involved, the risk of identification is considered so high that data protection rules prohibit the release of information when fewer than five individuals are involved. The website offered a free service to sample the tool's usefulness, which allowed the public to search for heart and respiratory conditions.\nIn a statement, the firm insisted the map contained \"mock data\".\nOn Monday night the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) said the website tool had been shut down and an investigation launched into how the data had been obtained, as it had not been cleared by its regulatory process.\nA spokesman for the information centre said: \"The link to this tool has been taken down following a request by the HSCIC. We are investigating urgently the source of the data used and whether controls demanded of any organisation using data have been maintained. After this investigation we will take any necessary action.\"\nIn a statement issued on its website, Earthware said it was \"confident that we have not breached any legal or regulatory rules regarding the licensing or publication of [Hospital Episode Statistics] data\".\nIt said that the map displayed mock data held by a third party; that the company had never held HES data on its servers and that no patient-identifiable data was ever displayed on the map. \"We will continue to co-operate fully with the HSCIC if required,\" it concluded.\nThe investigation comes amid concerns that there are potentially companies in the UK able to create data dossiers on patients by tapping new technologies to unearth ever more intimate information about the public. The dataset apparently came from hospital episode statistics, which hitherto had been considered a relatively \"safe\" repository of sensitive data.\nNHS England has previously defended its flagship care.data scheme – which proposes to extract data from GP surgeries – by pointing out that for 25 years hospital statistics had not suffered a major breach of privacy. Roll-out of the scheme was put on hold in February for six months.\nPhil Booth of medConfidential, which campaigns on medical privacy, told the Guardian that \"NHS England officials have claimed again and again that there has been no misuse of hospital episode statistics. Now a commercial real estate web mapping company appears to be getting access to hospital patient-level data.\"\nBooth called for a \"full transparent\" disclosure of all the hospital data so far released and called for the care.data scheme to be \"halted\". \"Until there has been a full transparent audit of every release of patient data the entire system that they propose must be halted.\"\nUnder care.data, unless patients opt out, the HSCIC will extract a person's NHS number, date of birth, postcode, ethnicity and gender. Once the system is live, organisations such as university research departments – but also insurers and drug companies – will be able to apply to the HSCIC to gain access to the database. If an application is approved then firms will have to pay to extract this information, which will be scrubbed of some personal identifiers but not enough to make the information completely anonymous – a process known as \"pseudonymisation\".\nThis week Jeremy Hunt will push through a number of amendments to the Care bill related to protecting privacy.\nThe coalition will create a new law that would bar any company that obtains patient information under the care.data programme and uses it in a malicious way from ever bidding to use medical records again. Hunt also proposes that the NHS's confidentiality advisory group, which advises the health secretary on accessing confidential patient data without consent – be made a statutory body.\nEarlier on Monday, Sarah Wollaston, who practised as a family doctor and is now a Tory MP on the health select committee, questioned how the NHS hospital patient database for England was handed to management consultants who uploaded it to Google servers based outside the UK.\nWollaston tweeted: \"So HES [hospital episode statistics] data uploaded to 'google's immense army of servers', who consented to that?\"\nThe patient information had been obtained by PA Consulting, which claimed to have secured the \"entire start-to-finish HES dataset across all three areas of collection – inpatient, outpatient and A&E\".\nThe data set was so large it took up 27 DVDs and took a couple of weeks to upload. The management consultants said: \"Within two weeks of starting to use the Google tools we were able to produce interactive maps directly from HES queries in seconds.\"\nExperts said there were concerns over the fact that data can easily be shared in the Google system - and that the danger of an accidental data leak would have catastrophic consequences for trust.\nIn a statement PA Consulting Group said it had purchased the data from the predecessor of the HSCIC. \"The data set does not contain information linked to specific individuals. The information is held securely in the cloud in accordance with conditions specified and approved by HSCIC.\"\nThe HSCIC said: \"PA Consulting used a product called Google BigQuery to manipulate the datasets provided and the NHS IC was aware of this. The NHS IC had written confirmation from PA Consulting prior to the agreement being signed that no Google staff would be able to access the data; access continued to be restricted to the individuals named in the data sharing agreement.\"\nThis article was amended on 5 March 2014 to remove an inaccurate reference to Earthware charging users for each search.

{"num":74,"Time":"Tue 28 Feb 2017 15.59 CET","Title":"CloudPets stuffed toys leak details of half a million users","Content":"The personal information of more than half a million people who bought internet-connected fluffy animals has been compromised.\nThe details, which include email addresses and passwords, were leaked along with access to profile pictures and more than 2m voice recordings of children and adults who had used the CloudPets stuffed toys.\nThe US company’s toys can connect over Bluetooth to an app to allow a parent to upload or download audio messages for their child.\nCloudPets’s chief executive, Mark Myers, denied that voice recordings were stolen in a statement to NetworkWorld magazine. “Were voice recordings stolen? Absolutely not.” He added: “The headlines that say 2m messages were leaked on the internet are completely false.” Myers also told NetworkWorld that when Motherboard raised the issue with CloudPets, “we looked at it and thought it was a very minimal issue”. Myers added that a hacker would only be able to access the sound recordings if they managed to guess the password. When the Guardian tried to contact Myers on Tuesday, emails to CloudPets’s official contact address were returned as undeliverable.\nCloudPets’s denial that voice recordings were “stolen” likely refers to the fact that the voice recordings were not contained in the exfiltrated database. It is possible to access the voice recordings without any authentication if you know the exact URL at which they are stored – something that can be gleaned by examining the app when a user is logged in. But the company had extremely lax password requirements (even officially recommending a password of “qwe” in a tutorial video), meaning that a large number of passwords could be “cracked” even given the secure method with which they were stored.\nAs such, it would be trivial for an attacker to access the voice recordings for users with simple passwords such as 123456 or cloudpets, but those with unique secure passwords could be covered in the case of a remote attack.\nTroy Hunt, owner of data breach monitoring service Have I Been Pwned, drew attention to the breach, which he first became aware of in mid-February. At that point, more than half a million records were being traded online. Hunt’s own source had first attempted to contact CloudPets in late December, but also received no response. While the database had been connected to the internet, it had more than 800,000 user records in it, suggesting that the data dump Hunt received is just a fraction of the full information potentially stolen.\nThe personal information was contained in a database connected directly to the internet, with no usernames or passwords preventing any visitor from accessing all the data. A week after Hunt’s contact first attempted to alert CloudPets, the original databases were deleted, and a ransom demand was left, and a week after that, no remaining databases were publicly accessible. CloudPets has not notified users of the hack.\nHunt argues the security flaws should undercut the entire premise of connected toys. “It only takes one little mistake on behalf of the data custodian – such as misconfiguring the database security – and every single piece of data they hold on you and your family can be in the public domain in mere minutes.\n“If you’re fine with your kids’ recordings ending up in unexpected places then so be it, but that’s the assumption you have to work on because there’s a very real chance it’ll happen. There’s no doubt whatsoever in my mind that there are many other connected toys out there with serious security vulnerabilities in the services that sit behind them. Inevitably, some would already have been compromised and the data taken without the knowledge of the manufacturer or parents.”\nJohn Madelin, CEO at IT security experts RelianceACSN, echoes Hunt’s warnings. “Connected toys that are easily accessible by hackers are sinister. The CloudPets issue highlights the fact that manufacturers of connected devices really struggle to bake security in from the start. The 2.2m voice recordings were stored online, but not securely, along with email addresses and passwords of 800,000 users, this is unforgivable.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about a data leak related to the CloudPets stuffed toys.

Optus has said it did not pay the ransom.\nHunt lists data breaches on his website to allow people to check whether their personal information has been compromised. He said ransom demands were not unusual for large data breaches such as that suffered by Optus, but the alleged attacker’s change of heart was unexpected.\n“Seeing the hacker back down, apologise and promise to delete the data is very rare. I suspect the amount of exposure the incident received plus the AFP involvement and commentary from high-level politicians spooked them,” he said.\nHow was the data accessed?\nReports suggest Optus had an application programming interface (API) available online that did not require authorisation or authentication to access customer data.\n“In the instance, where a public API endpoint did not require authentication, anyone on the internet with knowledge of that endpoint [URL] could use it,” said senior manager of cyber security consulting for Moss Adams, Corey J Ball.\nSign up to Morning Mail\nFree daily newsletter\nOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It maintains the attack was sophisticated, but the home affairs minister, Claire O’Neil, has said the vulnerability was akin to Optus leaving a window open.\nWhat data was taken?\nOptus says the stolen data includes names, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and for a portion of the affected customers, identification numbers including passport numbers, driver’s licence numbers and Medicare numbers.\nThe dump of records released by the forum user contained all this information.\nHow common is this method of attack?\n“Unfortunately, it can be pretty common,” Josh Lemon, a digital forensics and cyber incident expert at SANS Institute, said.\nGovernment flags new cybersecurity laws and increase in fines after Optus breach\nRead more\nBut he said attackers tended to not target a single organisation. They usually scan across the internet looking for known vulnerabilities and exploiting those vulnerabilities all at once, he said.\n“So for a threat actor to specifically just go after [one company] is a little bit unique in that sense.”\nWhat happens next?\nOptus customers have been urged to stay vigilant for signs their data has been compromised. State and federal governments are making it easier for those affected to replace identity documents that may have been accessed.\nWhile the alleged attacker has dropped the ransom threat, the criminal investigation is ongoing. The Australian federal police are working with law enforcement authorities overseas, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US, to locate whoever obtained the data, and who tried to sell it.\nThe federal government is looking at urgent reform in this area, including making it easier to alert banks to which of their customers may have been compromised.

If they have, replace them immediately.\nIf your email address was exposed, change your password for that account, and set up two-factor authentication where possible.\nTo protect yourself in future, use a password manager – such as 1password, LastPass or Keeper. These are paid services which can generate long and difficult passwords for your accounts, and store them for you so you don’t have to remember them.\nBut Dr Quodling warns that there is only so much users can do to prevent their data being used, apart from just quitting the social media platforms altogether.\n“You could be profoundly security conscious and secure, and still get caught out by insufficient security practices at other organisations you rely on,” he said.\n“The challenge is always how much of a risk are you personally willing to take?”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to a data leak, but it is not specifically about a Navigation system data leak.

{"num":80,"Time":"Sat 17 Mar 2018 14.02 CET","Title":"How Cambridge Analytica turned Facebook ‘likes’ into a lucrative political tool","Content":"T\nhe algorithm at the heart of the Facebook data breach sounds almost too dystopian to be real. It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings –the “likes” users dole out as they browse the site – to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma.\nA few dozen “likes” can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds.\nSome results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window.\nRevealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach\nRead more\nBut five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments.\nWhen users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality.\nThese were just some of the unexpected but consistent correlations noted in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal in 2013. “Few users were associated with ‘likes’ explicitly revealing their attributes. For example, less than 5% of users labelled as gay were connected with explicitly gay groups, such as No H8 Campaign,” the peer-reviewed research found.\nThe researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default.\n“The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said.\n“Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.”\nTo some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work.\nQuick Guide\nHow the Cambridge Analytica story unfolded\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.\nThe app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well.\nThe results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable.\nAleksandr Kogan\nTo be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters.\nIt was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use.\nAnd although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred.\nIt also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another.\nThe paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database.\nKogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.\nFacebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”\nThe scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed.\nWithin months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”.\nFacebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project.\nFacebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach.\nIt said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to the topic of data breach and privacy concerns related to Facebook.

He will be replaced by John Mulligan, chief financial officer. In February, Mulligan apologised to Congress for the breach.\n“The last several months have tested Target in unprecedented ways,” Steinhafel said in a letter to the board of directors. “We have already begun taking a number of steps to further enhance data security, putting the right people, processes and systems in place.\n“With several key milestones behind us, now is the right time for new leadership at Target.”\nThe breach was first disclosed by a security blogger, Brian Krebs, in December 2013.

{"num":83,"Time":"Tue 19 Jul 2022 06.19 CEST","Title":"TikTok has been accused of ‘aggressive’ data harvesting. Is your information at risk?","Content":"Cybersecurity experts have warned Australian TikTok users that the Chinese government could use the app to harvest personal information, from in-app messages with friends to precise device locations.\nThe warnings follow a report by Australian-US cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0, which found the most popular social media app of the year collects “excessive” amounts of information from its users.\nHere’s what you need to know about TikTok’s data harvesting, and how to keep your information safe.\nWhat’s different about the way TikTok collects data?\nTikTok’s data collection methods include the ability to collect user contact lists, access calendars, scan hard drives including external ones and geolocate devices on an hourly basis.\nGifts for strangers: the ‘ethically ambiguous’ TikTok trend using unknowing people as fodder for content\nRead more\n“When the app is in use, it has significantly more permissions than it really needs,” said Robert Potter, co-CEO of Internet 2.0 and one of the editors of the report.\n“It grants those permissions by default. When a user doesn’t give it permission … [TikTok] persistently asks.\n“If you tell Facebook you don’t want to share something, it won’t ask you again. TikTok is much more aggressive.”\nThe report labelled the app’s data collection practices “overly intrusive” and questioned their purpose.\n“The application can and will run successfully without any of this data being gathered. This leads us to believe that the only reason this information has been gathered is for data harvesting,” it concluded.\nMost of the concern in the report focuses on permissions sought on Android devices, because Apple’s iOS significantly limits what information an app can gather. It has a justification system so that if a developer wants access to something it must justify why this is required before it is granted.\n“We believe the justification system iOS implements systematically limits a culture of ‘grab what you can’ in data harvesting, “ the report states.\nDoes TikTok have connections with the Chinese government?\nTikTok is owned by the Chinese multinational internet company ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing. Founder Zhang Yiming sits at No. 28 on Bloomberg’s billionaires index.\nByteDance has denied a connection to the Chinese government in the past, and called the claim “misinformation” after various leaks suggested it censors material that does not align with Chinese foreign policy aims or mentions the country’s human rights record.\n“They are consistent in saying their app doesn’t connect to China, isn’t accessible to Chinese authorities and wouldn’t cooperate with Chinese authorities,” Potter said.\nBut he said Internet 2.0’s research found “Chinese authorities can actually access device data”. By sending tracked bots to the app, Internet 2.0 “consistently saw … data geolocating back to China”.\nPotter has said it wasn’t clear what data was being sent, just that the app was connecting to Chinese servers.\nTikTok is owned by ByteDance, which was founded by Zhang Yiming. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton\/Reuters\nThis month TikTok Australia admitted its staff in China were able to access Australian data.\n“Our security teams minimise the number of people who have access to data and limit it only to people who need that access in order to do their jobs,” Brent Thomas, the company’s Australian director of public policy, wrote in a letter. The letter was in response to questions from Senator James Paterson, the opposition’s cyber security and foreign interference spokesperson. Thomas said Australian data had never been given to the Chinese government.\nAre you at risk?\nUnder China’s national security laws Chinese companies are, upon request from the government, required to share access to data they collect.\n“You’re in a different digital ecosystem when you’re on a mainstream Chinese app,” Potter said. And “who you are” may determine the “level of risk” you are taking.\nAt an individual level, the average user might not be at immediate risk, Potter said. “But if you’re involved in something more sensitive or discussing topics that are sensitive … you’ve become very interesting to them very quickly.”\nA dissident in the Chinese diaspora community, or a critic of the Chinese government, might be “extremely concerned about their personal cyber security” on TikTok, Paterson said.\nTikTok told a 2020 Senate committee on foreign interference on social media that any request for Australian user data would need to go through a mutual legal assistance treaty process.\nOther governments also use their national security laws to gain access to user data from TikTok. TikTok publishes a half-yearly transparency report for data requests from governments.\nChina is not on the list of countries, but the list reveals Australian governments in the second half of 2021 made 51 requests for data related to 57 user accounts, with TikTok handing over data 41% of the time. The US made 1,306 requests for 1,003 accounts, with data handed over 86% of the time.\nHow can I keep my data safe?\nTikTok is now the most downloaded mobile entertainment app in Australia, with 7.38 million users over the age of 18.\nIf you decide to keep using TikTok, Potter suggests being “specific and granular about the level of permissions shared with the app”.\nSet permissions manually via in-app settings and in the device’s settings. Tom Kenyon, a director of Internet 2.0, also urged users to monitor those permissions regularly. “In any update, they can change access to permissions. It’s not set and forget.”\nPotter said users should continue to “ignore requests for sharing information”. He also urged young people to avoid using TikTok for “general messaging”.\n“If you want to share videos and look at cats, sure, go your hardest. If you’re going to have a conversation with your friends about your sexual orientation, or human rights, I’d be very wary.”\nKenyon said young people just starting their careers should think beyond the short term.\nKira Puru: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)\nRead more\nHe also urged senior public servants, public officials and members of parliament to “delete TikTok and other social media”. While the data already collected will not disappear from TikTok’s database, deleting the application will stop data collection into the future. If they are wanting to continue activity across platforms, Kenyon suggested “a separate, dedicated phone”.\nShould TikTok be banned?\nKenyon said that as it is an “avenue for data to flow to China … I absolutely think [TikTok] should be banned”.\nBut Potter said he is “very rarely in favour of bans”.\n“I am in favour of better regulation.”\nPotter said Australia must be clear “that we expect social media companies operating in Australia to respect our norms of privacy and freedom of speech”.\n“They need to be clear about how they operate. And if caught lying consistently, we need to have some way of holding those companies to account.\nCyber security minister Clare O’Neil says she is ‘certainly’ concerned by the data collection practices of some apps. Photograph: Darren England\/AAP\nThe federal minister for home affairs and cyber security, Clare O’Neil, said in a statement that the Australian government “has this report and has been well aware of these issues for some years”.\n“Australians need to be mindful … that they are sharing a lot of detailed information about themselves with apps that aren’t properly protecting that information.\n“I hope it concerns Australians because it certainly concerns me.”\nAustralian influencers have vowed to stay on the app despite concerns about Chinese data harvesting.\nThe Internet 2.0 report will be presented on Monday to a US Senate hearing on TikTok. With 142.2 million users in North America, the US is “obviously the dominant market for this app.”\n“I would expect TikTok will come under very hard questions about how the app operates,” Potter said.\nWhat does TikTok say about the report?\nTikTok has rejected the Internet 2.0 report as “baseless”.\nA TikTok spokesperson said: “The TikTok app is not unique in the amount of information it collects ...

Emails, texts, contact books, location data, photos and videos can all be extracted, and a phone’s microphone and camera can be activated to covertly record the user.\nThe consortium analysed a leaked dataset of 50,000 phone numbers that, it is believed, were identified as belonging to persons of interest to NSO’s customers. Forensic analysis of a sample of the mobile phones found dozens of cases of successful and attempted Pegasus infections.\nNSO Group says it takes ethical considerations seriously, is regulated by the export control regimes of Israel, Cyprus and Bulgaria and only sells to vetted government clients. But its customers have included repressive regimes, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan.\nSpeaking in an interview with the Guardian, Snowden said the consortium’s findings illustrated how commercial malware had made it possible for repressive regimes to place vastly more people under the most invasive types of surveillance.\n00:04:55\nPegasus: the spyware technology that threatens democracy – video\nFor traditional police operations to plant bugs or wiretap a suspect’s phone, law enforcement would need to “break into somebody’s house, or go to their car, or go to their office, and we’d like to think they’ll probably get a warrant”, he said.\nBut commercial spyware made it cost-efficient for targeted surveillance against vastly more people. “If they can do the same thing from a distance, with little cost and no risk, they begin to do it all the time, against everyone who’s even marginally of interest,” he said.\n“If you don’t do anything to stop the sale of this technology, it’s not just going to be 50,000 targets. It’s going to be 50 million targets, and it’s going to happen much more quickly than any of us expect.”\nPart of the problem arose from the fact that different people’s mobile phones were functionally identical to one another, he said. “When we’re talking about something like an iPhone, they’re all running the same software around the world. So if they find a way to hack one iPhone, they’ve found a way to hack all of them.”\nHe compared companies commercialising vulnerabilities in widely used mobile phone models to an industry of “infectioneers” deliberately trying to develop new strains of disease.\nWhat is Pegasus spyware and how does it hack phones?\nRead more\n“It’s like an industry where the only thing they did was create custom variants of Covid to dodge vaccines,” he said. “Their only products are infection vectors. They’re not security products. They’re not providing any kind of protection, any kind of prophylactic. They don’t make vaccines – the only thing they sell is the virus.”\nSnowden said commercial malware such as Pegasus was so powerful that ordinary people could in effect do nothing to stop it. Asked how people could protect themselves, he said: “What can people do to protect themselves from nuclear weapons?\n“There are certain industries, certain sectors, from which there is no protection, and that’s why we try to limit the proliferation of these technologies. We don’t allow a commercial market in nuclear weapons.”\nHe said the only viable solution to the threat of commercial malware was an international moratorium on its sale. “What the Pegasus project reveals is the NSO Group is really representative of a new malware market, where this is a for-profit business,” he said. “The only reason NSO is doing this is not to save the world, it’s to make money.”\nHe said a global ban on the trade in infection vectors would prevent commercial abuse of vulnerabilities in mobile phones, while still allowing researchers to identify and fix them.\n“The solution here for ordinary people is to work collectively. This is not a problem that we want to try and solve individually, because it’s you versus a billion dollar company,” he said. “If you want to protect yourself you have to change the game, and the way we do that is by ending this trade.”\nNSO Group said in a series of statements that it rejected “false claims” about the company and its clients, and said it did not have visibility over its clients use of Pegasus spyware. It said it only sold the software to vetted government clients, and that its technology had helped to prevent terrorism and serious crime.\nFollowing the launch of the Pegasus project, Shalev Hulio, the founder and chief executive of NSO, said he continued to dispute that the leaked data “has any relevance to NSO”, but added that he was “very concerned” about the reports and promised to investigate them all. “We understand that in some circumstances our customers might misuse the system,” he said.\nOn Tuesday 27 July, at 8pm BST, a panel including Agnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, will discuss the global implications of the Pegasus project.

Eventually she got an email saying she had been caught up in the breach, which exposed one in three Australians to the risk of identity theft or financial fraud.\nWith millions of others, she went about trying to change her driver’s licence. She even had a bar put on her own credit report, to stop anyone from trying to open a new account in her name.\n‘There’s one email’: worried Optus customers outraged by lack of help since data breach\nRead more\n“We’re really careful about our data,” she says.\n“I was really frustrated. They’re a big tech company. It’s frustrating and surprising that they’re so laissez faire with their data. Also, that they took their time in informing us.”\nThe alleged hacker – who threatened to sell the data unless a ransom was paid – took names, birth dates, phone numbers, addresses, and passport, healthcare and drivers’ license details from Optus, the country’s second-largest telecommunications company.\nOf the 10 million people whose data was exposed, almost 3 million had crucial identity documents accessed.\nAcross the country, current and former customers have been rushing to change their official documents as the US Federal Bureau of Investigation joined Australia’s police, cybersecurity, and spy agencies to investigate the breach.\nThe Australian government is looking at overhauling privacy laws after it emerged that Optus – a subsidiary of global telecommunications firm Singtel – had kept private information for years, even after customers had cancelled their contracts.\nIt is also considering a European Union-style system of financial penalties for companies that fail to protect their customers.\nAn error-riddled message from someone claiming to be the culprit and calling themselves “Optusdata” demanded a relatively modest US$1m ransom for the data.\n“We are businessmen,” Optusdata wrote in an online forum. “1.000.000$US is a lot of money and will keep to our word.”\nThat demand was followed by a threat to release the records of 10,000 peopleper day until the money was paid. A batch of 10,000 files was later published online.\nAs Optus and the federal government dealt with the fallout, the alleged hacker had a change of mind and offered their “deepest apology”.\n“Too many eyes,” they said. “We will not sale data to anyone. We cant if we even want to: personally deleted data.”\nOptus chief Kelly Bayer Rosmarin initially claimed the company had fallen prey to a sophisticated attack and said the associated IP address was “out of Europe”. She said police were “all over” the apparent release of information and told ABC radio that the security breach was “not as being portrayed”.’\nWhat is of concern for us is how what is quite a basic hack was undertaken on Optus\nClare O’Neill\nExperts have said Optus had an application programming interface (API) online that did not need authorisation or authentication to access customer data. “Any user could have requested any other user’s information,” Corey J Ball, senior manager of cyber security consulting for Moss Adams, said.\nRachael Falk, chief executive of the Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre, said while much was still unknown about the attack “sometimes even amateurs get lucky”.\n“There are outstanding hackers, often nation states who are really, really good at this and, invariably, it doesn’t take much to find a weakness, a vulnerability, a soft spot,” she said.\n“[Or] they can literally be a person in a basement, a person who likes to tinker on the side.”\nOptus ‘left the window open’\nThe cyber security minister, Clare O’Neill, has questioned why Optus had held on to that much personal information for so long.\nShe also scoffed at the idea the hack was sophisticated.\n“What is of concern for us is how what is quite a basic hack was undertaken on Optus,” she told the ABC. “We should not have a telecommunications provider in this country which has effectively left the window open for data of this nature to be stolen.”\nMinister for home affairs Clare O’Neil during question time in the House of Representatives this week. Photograph: Mick Tsikas\/AAP\nAsked about Rosmarin’s comments that the attack was sophisticated, O’Neill said: “Well, it wasn’t.”\nOn Friday, prime minister Anthony Albanese said what had happened was “unacceptable”. He said Optus had agreed to pay for replacement passports for those affected.\n“Australian companies should do everything they can to protect your data,” Albanese said.\n“That’s why we’re also reviewing the Privacy Act – and we’re committed to making privacy laws stronger.”\nThe Australian Information Commissioner is also investigating. Commissioner Angelene Falk said companies “must take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the personal information they hold”.\n“Collecting and storing unnecessary information breaches privacy and creates risk,” she said.\nAustralia currently has a $2.2m limit on corporate penalties, and there are calls for harsher penalties to encourage companies to do everything they can to protect consumers.\nIn the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation means companies are liable for up to 4% of the company’s revenue. Optus’s revenue last financial year was more than $7bn.\nOn Friday, the Australian federal police announced a special operation to protect the identity of the 10,000 victims whose details were already published online.\nAustralian federal police assistant commissioner Justine Gough has announced a special operation to safeguard the identities of 10,000 people whose personal information was published online. Photograph: Joel Carrett\/AAP\nAFP assistant commissioner Justine Gough said the operation would “supercharge” their protection against identity crime and financial fraud.\nIn its recently published annual report, Optus’s parent company, Singtel, touted its ability to protect against data theft and cyber attacks.\nAs a victim of identity theft, I know just how quickly it can happen – and how hard it is to fix\nRead more\n“We value the privacy of our customer data stored within our networks and systems as they may be harmed if their data is compromised or misused,” Singtel said.\n“We have in place appropriate safeguards and controls to ensure the security and protection of our customer data.”\n*Names have been changed.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to a Navigation system data leak because it discusses a significant cyber attack involving Optus, a telecommunications provider.

He urged members to “exercise maximum vigilance” on and off duty.\n“We must do all we can to frustrate and prevent attacks on our colleagues and their families. Our men and women are resilient and resourceful. They must call on all their training and professionalism to counter this ugly consequence of a monumental data breach,” he said.\n“We have to be strong and determined to do everything we can to minimise risk and that means varying the routes we take to and from work, changing routines and reassessing our personal security.”\nByrne said the force was working around the clock to assess and mitigate risks, but the volume of personnel involved made it difficult to “triage and ring people back”. He rejected media reports that some officers and staff had quit the PSNI.\nThe PSNI had been strongly supported by cyber specialists from across the policing system, he said. “We have measures in place to reassure and advise our workforce of what this risks means for them. We will continue to liaise with the policing board and the UK government, as well as other partners, as we develop our response to this matter.”\nEarlier on Monday, a document purportedly from the data leak appeared on a wall beside a Sinn Féin office on Falls Road. A threatening message and a photograph of Gerry Kelly, the party’s policing spokesperson, appeared alongside the poster.\n“This is a very obvious attempt by dissident republicans to intimidate me,” said Kelly, a member of the Stormont assembly. “Even more sinister, this is a very public indication that the dissidents do have access to the sensitive information in the data leak document. It therefore represents a very real threat to the officers and the civilian staff involved.”\nSinn Féin would not be intimidated by dissident groups that had negligible support and offered nothing but disruption and threats in an attempt to gain relevance, he said.\nGerry Kelly, Sinn Féin’s policing spokesperson, gives a statement on Monday. Photograph: Liam McBurney\/PA Media\nThe PSNI apologised for “systemic” failures that led to the names, ranks and departments of staff appearing briefly online on 8 August in a bungled response to a freedom of information request.\nThere was an earlier data breach on 6 July when a police-issue laptop and documents identifying 200 officers and staff were stolen from a private vehicle. The PSNI was notified on 4 August, a time lag that has fuelled criticism of the force’s response to the leaks.\nPolice representatives fear the crisis will especially affect the recruitment of Catholics, who are deemed most vulnerable to paramilitary attack.\nAn officer from a nationalist background said in a letter to the Guardian: “For 18 years, I’ve relied on my family to help me protect my identity. I’ve denied myself a social life and gave up sports I loved. I can’t stay in touch with old friends on social media as I need to avoid the footprint. Now, this is all taken away at the click of a button.”\nAbout 3,000 officers have contacted the police federation about a potential legal case for damages. Lawyers have estimated that the eventual bill could be tens of millions of pounds.\nNearly 2,000 officers and support staff have expressed personal security concerns because of the leaks.\nThey have given republican paramilitaries such as the New IRA a powerful tool to demoralise and collect intelligence on officers and their families for years to come, according to security experts.\nDissident groups have staged sporadic attacks in Northern Ireland over the past decade, including shooting and wounding DCI John Caldwell in February.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to the topic of a Navigation system data leak.

Many of these interpreters are in hiding from the Taliban, and the exposure of their information could jeopardize their safety. The MoD has acknowledged the breach, apologized, and initiated an investigation. They are also offering advice to those affected on how to manage potential risks. This incident has raised concerns about the safety and security of Afghan interpreters who assisted British forces and has been labeled as an 'unacceptable breach' by the defense secretary.\"\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk-news\/2021\/sep\/20\/mod-data-breach-puts-lives-at-risk-for-more-than-250-afghan-interpreters","query_name":"updated_file_Navigation_system_data_leak.xlsx"}

When an attacker has this token they can take full control of a victim’s account, including logging into third-party applications that use Facebook Login.\nThis high-stakes matter may become the defining moment of GDPR\nDr Lukasz Olejnik, security expert\nThe breach comes at time when Facebook is under heavy scrutiny over issues including foreign interference in elections, its role in spreading misinformation and hate speech, and privacy.\nFacebook announced the breach in a blogpost on Friday, saying it was taking the issue “incredibly seriously”. Over the weekend the commission said it was “concerned that this breach was discovered on Tuesday and affects millions of users”.\nFacebook was “unable to clarify the nature of breach and risk” to users at that point, the commission said, adding that it was pushing the company to “urgently clarify these matters”.\nRowenna Fielding, a senior data protection lead at Protecture Limited, said: “Facebook should have tested the ‘view as’ function with a ‘what could an attacker do with this’ mindset and they either didn’t, or didn’t care about the gaping hole.”\nThe investigation will focus on ‘Facebook’s compliance with its obligation under (GDPR)’. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\nDr Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity and privacy adviser, noted that this was the first major GDPR investigation that would test whether Facebook followed its rules around security of data processing.\n“This high-stakes matter may become the defining moment of GDPR,” he said.\nOther data security experts believe that Facebook will get off lightly.\n“The Irish regulator doesn’t really have a track record of robust enforcement, so I don’t think Facebook is likely to be concerned about penalties they might levy,” said Fielding.\nShe said that the $1.63bn potential fine was “unlikely”, describing it as a “ceiling, not a stipulation”.\n“However, the precedent set by any regulatory finding of unlawful processing could be very significant, especially in follow-on litigation by individual data subjects affected,” she added.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Navigation system data leak because it discusses a massive data breach involving Facebook, which is a technology company that handles sensitive user data.

{"num":96,"Time":"Wed 9 Aug 2023 12.08 CEST","Title":"Electoral Commission and PSNI data breaches: what we know so far","Content":"The UK election watchdog and Northern Ireland’s police service both announced serious data breaches on Tuesday, in the latest example of the vulnerability of personal details to hacks and human error.\nThe UK data regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), is looking at the incidents, which have raised immediate safety concerns over the consequences of leaking personal data. Here is what has happened and what we know so far.\nWhat happened at the Electoral Commission\nThe commission, an independent body that oversees elections in the UK, said on Tuesday it had been the subject of a “complex cyber-attack” that resulted in hackers accessing reference copies of the electoral registers. These contained the name and address of anyone in the UK who was registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as names of overseas voters. This equates to the data of 40 million people. The Electoral Commission said it did not know whether the data had been downloaded.\nThe commission said it was “not able to know conclusively” what information had been accessed. It added that the personal data in the commission’s email system, which was also hacked, included email addresses of people who had contacted the commission; any personal images sent to the commission; and contact telephone numbers. Again, the electoral commission does not know whether any of the email data was taken.\nThe commission said the attack was spotted in October 2022 but had in fact started in August 2021, indicating the sophistication of the assailants.\nWhat happened at the Police Service of Northern Ireland\nThe PSNI incident is of a different nature to the Electoral Commission attack and appears to have been due to human error. A spreadsheet was mistakenly published online detailing the surname, initial, rank or grade, location and the department of all current PSNI officers and civilian staff members. Private addresses were not released.\nAccording to the PSNI, the data was released accidentally in response to a freedom of information request and was available to the public for up to three hours before the error was spotted.\nShould PSNI staff be concerned?\nThe PSNI’s assistant chief constable Chris Todd said the data release was limited in nature but was still of “significant concern”.\n“It is limited to surname and initial only, so there’s no other personal identifiable information contained within the information that was published.\n“That will be still a significant concern to many of my colleagues, I know that, and we will ensure that we do everything we can to mitigate any security risks that are identified.”\n00:02:06\nPSNI apologies to police officers after unprecedented data breach – video\nWho is responsible for the Electoral Commission hack?\nExperts say the sophistication and ambition of the attack points to a state-backed entity, with Russia top of the list for some observers.\nDavid Omand, a former director of the British spy agency GCHQ, told BBC Radio 4’s PM that Russia was “first on my list of suspects”, while Sir Richard Dearlove, a former head of MI6, told the Daily Telegraph that the Kremlin would “be at the top of the suspects list by a mile”.\nAlan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, said Russia’s history of trying to interfere in elections – particularly the US presidential election in 2016 – made it an obvious candidate.\nSign up to First Edition\nFree daily newsletter\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

China, Iran, take your pick,” he said.\nCould elections be affected?\nThe commission said it would be “very hard” to use a cyber-attack to influence the electoral process. According to Shaun McNally, the commission’s chief executive, the reliance on paper votes helps maintain the integrity of the system.\n“The UK’s democratic process is significantly dispersed and key aspects of it remain based on paper documentation and counting. This means it would be very hard to use a cyber-attack to influence the process,” he said on Tuesday.\nNonetheless, the potential leak of millions of voters’ details could leave them exposed to manipulation before they make their paper vote. It could also leave them exposed to fraud attempts, which state-sponsored actors have been known to attempt as well as cybercriminals.\nThe commission admitted on Tuesday that the information could be combined with other data, such as social media, to profile individuals.\n“It is possible however that this data could be combined with other data in the public domain, such as that which individuals choose to share themselves, to infer patterns of behaviour or to identify and profile individuals,” it said.\nDo the Electoral Commission and PSNI face fines?\nThe ICO said last year that it was planning to “reduce the impact of fines on the public sector” for mishandling of data, as part of a new approach which would focus on warnings and enforcement notices.\nHowever, it said fines could still be issued in “the most serious cases”, which is undoubtedly the category for the electoral commission and PSNI incidents. In 2021, before this new approach was announced, the ICO fined the Cabinet Office £500,000 after the postal addresses of the 2020 new year honours recipients were disclosed online.\nAt the time of the statement, in June 2022, the ICO said it would be “working more closely with the public sector to encourage compliance with data protection law and prevent harms before they happen”. There is clearly more work to be done.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The news is relevant to a data breach, which is a key indicator of a potential Navigation system data leak.\",\n\"The Electoral Commission experienced a complex cyber-attack that resulted in hackers accessing reference copies of electoral registers, including the name and address of anyone in the UK who was registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as names of overseas voters, totaling data of 40 million people.\",\n\"The personal data in the commission’s email system was also hacked, including email addresses of people who had contacted the commission, personal images, and contact telephone numbers.\",\n\"The attack was detected in October 2022 but had actually started in August 2021, suggesting a sophisticated cyber-attack.\",\n\"The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had a data breach due to human error, where a spreadsheet containing information about current PSNI officers and civilian staff members was mistakenly published online, though private addresses were not released.\",\n\"The release of PSNI data was accidental and was available to the public for up to three hours before the error was identified.\",\n\"The news discusses potential suspects for the Electoral Commission hack, with experts mentioning Russia as a prime candidate, which implies foreign involvement in the breach.\",\n\"The potential consequences of the data breach include exposure to manipulation before voting, fraud attempts, and data profiling using combined information from different sources.\",\n\"The ICO has the authority to issue fines for mishandling of data, and fines could be issued in the most serious cases, such as these incidents.\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politics\/2023\/aug\/09\/electoral-commission-and-psni-data-breaches-what-we-know-so-far","query_name":"updated_file_Navigation_system_data_leak.xlsx"}

On Monday, British Airways received a £183m fine after a hack involving personal data of half a million of the airline’s customers, the ICO’s first GDPR fine.\nThe ICO, which is proposing a £99.2m fine for Marriott, said that about 30 million of the hacked guest records related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area. Seven million related to UK residents.\nMarriott said it would appeal against the fine.\nAfter an investigation the ICO said the issue appeared to begin when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott acquired Starwood in 2016, although the theft of customer information was not discovered until last year.\nThe ICO said Marriott had failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it acquired Starwood and should have done more to make sure its IT systems were secure.\n“The GDPR makes it clear that organisations must be accountable for the personal data they hold,” said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. “This can include carrying out proper due diligence when making a corporate acquisition, and putting in place proper accountability measures to assess not only what personal data has been acquired, but how it is protected.”\nIn a statement the company said it intended to respond and vigorously defend its position.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n“We are disappointed with this notice of intent from the ICO, which we will contest,” said Arne Sorenson, the president and chief executive of Marriott International. “We deeply regret this incident happened. We take the privacy and security of guest information very seriously and continue to work hard to meet the standard of excellence that our guests expect from Marriott.”\nMarriott said the Starwood guest reservation database that was the subject of the hack was no longer used for business operations.\nThe ICO can seek a fine of up to 4% of a company’s global annual revenue for a breach under the GDPR. This is a significant increase on the maximum fine of up to £500,000 it could levy under the UK’s previous data protection regime.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to the Navigation system data leak because it discusses a significant data breach at Marriott International, where hackers stole the records of 339 million guests.

Many of the material in the cache matches images, audio files, and documents currently published on the Counter-Currents website. Matching files include audio files of Counter-Currents Radio podcasts, PDF documents of far-right books the organization has shared with readers and image files.\nThe Guardian emailed Counter-Currents for comment from Johnson but received no response.\nSome of the material in the cache, however, has never been published.\nOne such file is a recording of a 2017 interview between an American journalist and Counter-Currents co-founder, Michael Polignano, who was billed in the site’s early days as “managing editor and webmaster” of Counter-Currents, and who has lived in the Hungarian capital of Budapest since 2014.\nIn the interview, Polignano discusses having been “a member of the National Alliance and a follower of William Pierce”, and as “part of this whole antisemitic right that’s where you see Jews as this alien race … as less than human and just kind of different creatures from humanity”.\nPierce founded the neo-Nazi National Alliance in 1974 and led it until his death in 2002. He also wrote the novel of race war, The Turner Diaries, which inspired murderous groups including the Order and the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, who describes him as the neo-Nazi movement’s “fiercest antisemitic ideologue”.\nOn 15 August 2022, Polignano posted on Facebook a photo of himself visiting Pierce in 2000 at his home in Hillsboro, West Virginia, with the caption: “Hard to believe it was 22 years ago.” In other recent posts, Polignano shared pictures of himself in Budapest with far-right figures including Jason Kessler, organizer of the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. He also recently attended a show by the neo-Nazi band Skrewdriver.\nDespite his long-term involvement in antisemitic politics, Polignano made detailed claims in the 2017 recording about a sexual relationship he had before leaving the United States with a woman who was “a leftwing secular, atheist Jew” and herself in a “polyamorous relationship” with her husband.\nThe Guardian cross-referenced metadata on the 2017 recording and contextual clues in the recording to identify the journalist Polignano spoke with as the freelance journalist Carol Schaeffer.\nSince 2017, Schaeffer, who is based between New York and Berlin, has published journalism tracking and monitoring the European far right. She confirmed in a telephone conversation that the conversation had taken place in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, on 2 January 2017.\nSchaeffer told the Guardian that she “didn’t end up using anything” from “multiple interviews” with Polignano as she came to think that his answers were in part a performance.\n“He wanted to present himself as a complex character and I think he wanted to present his antisemitism as something that was emotionally earned, or that he had thought deeply about it,” she said.\nSign up to First Thing\nFree daily newsletter\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Metadata indicates it was uploaded in December 2019.\nRequests for comment to Polignano’s previously listed emails bounced, including one sent to a previously listed address at the Counter-Currents domain. The Guardian asked Counter-Currents for Polignano’s current contact details but received no response.\nOn Polignano’s ongoing residence in Hungary, and the far-right milieu in Hungary at that time, Beirich, the extremism expert, said that in 2017, “Hungary was already providing a sympathetic home for people with white nationalist ideas,” and that “the Orbán regime itself, because it’s anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ, anti-refugee, and authoritarian, is extremely appealing to white nationalists.”\nNow, she added, “the Orbán regime is directly connected to powerhouse, far-right actors in multiple countries, including the United States,” including “connections among the Trump people with the Orbán people”.\n“In a way, all these connections you’re talking about in Budapest from that time period presage phenomena like CPAC Hungary,” Beirich concluded, referring to the now-annual conferences held by the US rightwing Conservative Political Action Committee in Budapest.\nOther unpublished materials on the site include what appear to be manuscripts for published works, including a Microsoft Office manuscript for an anthology, The Alternative Right, that Counter-Currents published in 2018.\nThe files also include recordings of speeches to the Northwest Forum, an invitation-only far-right gathering that Johnson convened from 2016 in Seattle, which featured prominent white nationalists as speakers, and subjected new attendees to rigorous vetting. The website for that event has been offline since 2020, according to Internet Archive records.\nThe Guardian reviewed the leaked data in a copy hosted on the Grayhat Warfare website, which collects and preserves the content of so-called buckets uploaded by website administrators to cloud storage providers including Amazon, Google, Microsoft Azure and Digital Ocean.\nThe Guardian emailed Grayhat Warfare administrators for comment on the data but received no immediate response.\nJim Salter is a system administrator, consultant and co-host of the 2.5 Admins podcast. In a video call, Salter told the Guardian that the data was “most likely a backup of the web service directory of a Wordpress site”, noting that sensitive php files were missing, and that “the absence of the content of written posts means that third-party web scraping seems unlikely”.\nHe added that tech media attention to the problem of open storage buckets meant that “Amazon added a dashboard warning indicator whenever you had an open S3 bucket in 2017”, but that leaving buckets open was still common.\n“People are idiots about security,” Salter said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to a data leak, but it does not pertain to a Navigation system data leak.

NSO insists the database has “no relevance” to the company.\nPegasus project turns spotlight on spyware firm NSO’s ties to Israeli state\nRead more\nNSO said Macron was not a “target” of any of its customers, meaning the company denies he was selected for surveillance using Pegasus, its spyware. The company added that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative of whether that number was selected for surveillance using Pegasus.\nQuick Guide\nWhat is in the Pegasus project data?\nShow\nBut the list is believed to be indicative of individuals identified as persons of interest by government clients of NSO. It includes people who were later targeted for surveillance, according to forensic analysis of their phones.\nNSO insists it requires its government clients to only use its powerful spying tools for legitimate investigations into terrorism or crime.\nThe Guardian and other media partners in the Pegasus project, an international consortium, identified those governments believed to be responsible for selecting individual numbers in the data by closely examining the patterns of selection.\nPolitical figures whose numbers appear in the list include:\nThe South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, who appears to have been selected by Rwanda in 2019.\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, who appears to have been selected as a person of interest by Morocco in 2019. An Élysée official said: “If this is proven, it is clearly very serious. All light will be shed on these media revelations.”\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director general, who also appears to have been of interest to Morocco in 2019.\nSaad Hariri, who resigned as prime minister of Lebanon last week and appears to have been selected by the UAE in 2018 and 2019.\nCharles Michel, the president of the European Council, who appears to have been chosen as a person of interest by Morocco in 2019, when he was prime minister of Belgium.\nKing Mohammed VI of Morocco, who was selected as a person of interest in 2019, apparently by security forces in his own country.\nSaadeddine Othmani, Morocco’s prime minister, who was also selected as a person of interest in 2018 and 2019, again possibly by elements within his own country.\nImran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, who was selected as a person of interest by India in 2019.\nFelipe Calderón of Mexico, the former president. His number was selected in 2016 and 2017 by what is believed to have been a Mexican client during a period when his wife, Margarita Zavala was running for the country’s top political job.\nRobert Malley, a longtime American diplomat who was chief negotiator on the US-Iran deal, and who appears to have been selected as a person of interest by Morocco in 2019. NSO has said its government clients are prevented from deploying its software against US numbers because it has been made “technically impossible”.\nThe Pegasus project could not examine the mobile phones of the leaders and diplomats, and could therefore not confirm whether there had been any attempt to install malware on their phones.\nIn addition to denying Macron was a “target”, an NSO Group spokesperson also said King Mohammed VI and Tedros Ghebreyesus “are not, and never have been, targets or selected as targets of NSO Group customers”.\nLawyers for NSO said the firm defined targets as people who were “selected for surveillance using Pegasus, regardless of whether an attempt to infect her or his device is successful”.\nThe surveillance company says it does not have access to the data of its customers, but says that they are obligated to provide the firm with such information when they have placed them under investigation. The company appears to have undertaken such an investigation into Morocco, which is believed to be one of its clients.\nForensic examinations of a sample of 67 phones in the leaked data belonging to human rights activists, journalists and lawyers found 37 had contained traces of Pegasus infection or attempted infection. The analysis was done by Amnesty International’s Security Lab, a technical partner on the project.\nThe leaked data also suggests Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have appeared eager to consider monitoring Egyptian officials, despite both countries’ close ties to Egypt’s authoritarian ruler, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.\nAmong the numbers selected as individuals of interest by an NSO client believed to be the Saudi government was that of the Egyptian prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly.\nBoth Saudi and UAE are believed to have selected Barham Salih, the president of Iraq, who is close to the US, as a candidate of interest to their governments. Salih’s UK number also appeared in the list.\nNeither Saudi Arabia or the UAE have responded to requests for comment.\nQ&A\nWhat is the Pegasus project?\nShow\nRwandan authorities have staunchly denied having access to NSO Group technology, but have long been suspected of being a client of the Israeli firm. An analysis of the leaked data shows that Ruhakana Rugunda was selected as a candidate for potential surveillance in 2018 and 2019, when he served as prime minister of Uganda – a selection seemingly made by the government of Rwanda.\nMorocco has denied spying on any foreign leaders, and has said reporters investigating NSO were “incapable of proving [the country had] any relationship” with the Israeli company. But an analysis of the leaked records showed Morocco appeared to have listed dozens of French officials as candidates for possible surveillance, including Macron.\nNeither India or Pakistan have commented specifically on claims that Delhi may have selected Khan for targeting. India has said it has well established protocols for interception which requires approval from highly ranked national or regional officials for “for clear stated reasons only in national interest.”\nSeveral state agencies in Mexico have acquired the Pegasus spyware starting with the defence ministry in 2011, and pervasive corruption in the country has prompted concerns that it could end up in the wrong hands.\n00:04:55\nPegasus: the spyware technology that threatens democracy – video\nThe country’s former interior minister Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong, who served between 2012 and 2018, told the Pegasus project that during his term of office the interior ministry “never, never authorised or had knowledge or information that Cisen [Mexico’s national security intelligence service] owned or acquired the Pegasus hacking kit, and never authorised anything to do with hacking”.\nIn its statement, NSO said the leaked list “is not a list of targets or potential targets of NSO’s customers”. Through its lawyers, NSO previously said the consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s technology. It said the 50,000 number was “exaggerated” and the list could not be a list of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”.\nFollowing the launch of the Pegasus project, Shalev Hulio, the founder and chief executive of NSO, said he continued to dispute the leaked data “has any relevance to NSO”, but added that he was “very concerned” about the reports and promised to investigate them all. “We understand that in some circumstances our customers might misuse the system,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Shah Meer Baloch in Islamabad","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to the Navigation system data leak because it mentions the leaked Pegasus project data, which includes the mobile phone numbers of several high-profile individuals, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and other heads of state and government.

I’ve taken three different dives with this company and you almost always [lose] communication.”\nThe Guardian understands that all standard checks and procedures were followed before the submersible set off on its voyage, but concerns over whether the vessel met industry safety standards have come to light.\nOn Tuesday, the New York Times published a letter written in 2018 by industry leaders in the submersible vessel field, warning Rush of possible “catastrophic” problems with Titan’s development.\nThe Marine Technology Society, an industry group made up of ocean engineers, technologists, policymakers and educators, expressed “concern regarding the development of Titan and the planned Titanic expeditions” and warned against the “current experimental approach adopted by OceanGate”.\nAt issue was whether the Titan vessel would be independently assessed by industry regulators or risk assessors.\nThe Marine Technology Society was critical of OceanGate issuing marketing material that stated the Titan design would “meet or exceed the DNV-GL safety standards” while apparently not intending to have the vessel assessed by that same organisation.\nThe DNV is an independent organisation, described as the world’s leading classification society for the maritime industry, which certifies vessels such as submersibles and issues regulations for such products.\nIn the case of vessels such as Titan, the DNV classification process examines whether “internationally recognised rules” were followed and includes inspections during the constructions and operations phase.\nIn its letter, the Marine Technology Society wrote: “We recommend that at a minimum, you institute a prototype testing program that is reviewed and witnessed by DNV-GL.”\nA spokesperson for OceanGate declined to comment on the 2018 letter when approached by the New York Times.\nIn an unpublished interview with the Guardian late last year, Rush said the vessel had been custom built to reach and view the Titanic, describing it as capable of making a 2.5-mile drop through the water column but deft enough to be steered just inches from the wreck.\n“We had to make our own sub,” he said. “So our sub weighs about half as much as any other deep diving sub, or research sub, that’s been down there. And it because it’s smaller and lighter, it’s much more manoeuvrable. And so we can get very close.”\nHe said the vessel had room for five people. “People come in thinking ‘oh, I’m claustrophobic,’” he said. “But it’s no more claustrophobic than taking a plane.”\nRush also spoke of the dangers of the expeditions. “One of the hardest things we have to do is get inches from the Titanic, because we’re dropping two and a half miles through the water column and we don’t know what the currents are. And they change day to day and season to season and they change at 300 metres. There’s a huge shift at the thermocline [the transition layer between warmer surface waters and colder deeper water] and we don’t have a way of tracking that.”\nHe added: “We’ve been fortunate that on the wreck the currents have been fairly light. If the currents are high then you change your profile and how close you’ll get to the wreck. But if it’s very calm … I can write my name in the mud with the sub. It’s that manoeuvrable.”\nAlmost a year after the Marine Technology Society letter was sent, OceanGate published a blogpost explaining why it would not have Titan certified. In the post, the company acknowledged that classification assures “vessels are designed, constructed and inspected to accepted standards”, but claimed it did little to “weed out sub-par vessel operators”. The company claimed “operator error” was responsible for the vast majority of accidents.\nOceanGate was also concerned that the classing process could slow down development and act as a drag on innovation. “Bringing an outside entity up to speed on every innovation before it is put into real-world testing is anathema to rapid innovation,” it said.\nIn an interview with the Smithsonian magazine in 2019, Rush complained that the commercial sub industry had not “innovated or grown – because they have all these regulations”.\nIt is not clear whether the Titan has received industry certification since the blogpost was published, but in 2022 a CBS News reporter who was due to travel on the vessel reported that the waiver he signed read: “This experimental vessel has not been approved or certified by any regulatory body.”\n00:01:52\n'Banging noises' heard as search continues for Titanic sub – video\nIn defending its decision not to have the Titan classed, the company highlighted what it said were safety innovations onboard, including “carbon fiber pressure vessels and a real-time (RTM) hull health monitoring system”.\nThe ability of the sub’s hull design to withstand such depths was questioned in a 2018 lawsuit filed by OceanGate’s former director of marine operations David Lochridge, who said he was fired after he raised safety concerns about the vessel.\nOceanGate said in its breach of contract suit against Lochridge, who is not an engineer, that he refused to accept the lead engineer’s assurances and accused him of improperly sharing confidential information. The two sides settled their court case in November 2018.\nThe company did not respond to requests for comment from the Reuters news agency, and its attorney in the Lochridge case, Thomas Gilman, declined comment.\nOceanGate said it was “mobilising all options” in the search, and the US Coast Guard Rear Adm John Mauger told NBC News the company was helping to guide the search efforts.\n“They know that site better than anybody else,” Mauger said. “We’re working very closely with them to prioritise our underwater search efforts and get equipment there.”\nReuters contributed to this report","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents as it discusses concerns over the safety of the Titan submersible, which had to operate at a depth similar to where the Titanic rests (4,000 meters below sea level).\",\n\"The news mentions the potential risk of losing contact with the surface, which is a critical issue related to navigation system errors.\",\n\"Experts have raised questions about whether all appropriate safety measures were followed, indicating a possible issue with the navigation or safety systems.\",\n\"The Marine Technology Society expressed concern about the development of Titan and questioned whether it would meet industry safety standards, suggesting potential navigation system errors.\",\n\"The mention of safety innovations onboard, such as the hull health monitoring system, indicates a focus on safety systems, which are related to navigation and overall operational safety.\",\n\"The lawsuit filed by a former director of marine operations, who raised safety concerns about the vessel's hull design, suggests potential issues with the submersible's navigation and structural systems.\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/jun\/21\/titanic-submersible-documents-reveal-multiple-concerns-raised-over-safety-of-vessel","query_name":"updated_file_Navigation_system_error_incidents.xlsx"}
{"num":4,"Time":"Sat 3 Apr 2021 11.36 CEST","Title":"Wind ... or worse: was pilot error to blame for the Suez blockage?","Content":"T\nhe trouble started at 5:17am. Ever Given, an Ultra Large Container Vessel (ULCV) loaded with 20,000 containers, had set off up the Suez canal a quarter of an hour earlier from the south, in the bay of Suez.\nThis is how the canal works: ships anchor the night before and wait to set off early the following morning – one convoy southbound from Port Said starting at 3.30am, the northbound one at 5:00am. They meet each other at Great Bitter Lake, where the southbound convoy anchors to let the other pass. Consider a country lane with passing spots, only for ships the height of buildings, travelling at the speed of a scooter.\nThere are convoys because for much of its 120-mile length the canal is narrow. A two-way system was constructed at great expense by Egypt in 2015, shortening the southbound convoy transit to 11 hours. But it only runs for 22 miles. For the rest of the passage, the ships must travel single file down a very slim route.\nEver Given was big, and she was heavy. As is normal in global shipping, her usual route was to head east to fetch goods from Asia, then to return laden. She was also wide, with a “beam” – or width – of 194ft and her depth underwater was 51ft. ULCV is a specification given to a craft with a capacity greater than 20,000 twenty-foot equivalent units. The Suez regulations require special permission for ships of Ever Given’s size, but she just qualified as Suezmax: the maximum dimensions allowed for shipping to transit the canal.\nShips wait to pass the Suez Canal on the Great Bitter Lake. Photograph: Xinhua\/REX\/Shutterstock\nThe weather was not calm. Not only was there a wind of 30mph coming from the port quarter – the back left – but there was also a sandstorm. Ever Given left her harbour and set off at 8 knots. When I transited Suez on a container ship in 2010, I remember it feeling like an amble. It was also dull: green water, sand, some habitation here and there. After a few hours, I understood why the crew had scorned it as “a ditch in a desert.” Even the laconic first officer was moved to express an opinion: “Sand, sand, sand.” Mishap seems impossible, I told the captain at the time, as we stood on the bridge while the pilot dozed. “Wrong,” he said.\nOnce, he recalled, he was leaving the container terminal to enter the canal when the pilot beached the ship on sand. The captain stepped in by overruling the pilot, got the ship off the bank, then took a much-deserved break. “When I came back, I said, ‘Where’s the bloody pilot?’” Then I saw his head popping up. He was on the deck, praying.”\nSuez may look serene, but navigating big ships in shallow canals can be tricky. Ships take on board a “Suez pilot” and a “Suez crew”, who are mandated for their local knowledge. It is well known that these officers must be “lubricated” with cartons of Marlboro and goodies from the bond locker (the ship tuck-shop), leading to another crew nickname for Suez: the Marlboro canal. “I don’t think the Egyptians could have built the pyramids,” a senior engineer once told me. “They couldn’t have: they didn’t have Marlboro then.”\nThis is offensive to those Egyptians who believe the canal is a source of great national pride, but on my trip I watched the Suez pilot eat his way through the whole lunch menu, then snooze – on the sofa, on the captain’s chair, on the watch officer’s chair. The second officer had to keep waking him up for instructions.\nA satellite handout image show s the Ever Givenlodged sideways across Suez Canal. Photograph: Planet Labs\/AFP\/Getty Images\nWe don’t know what the pilot was doing on the morning the Ever Given set off, carrying nearly three times as many boxes as the ship I traveled on – but we know that 5:17am is when the ship first veered towards the portside bank. The trajectory, however, was corrected. For the next 25 minutes (as seen in this simulation, based on satellite data), the ship sped up to more than 13 knots. One explanation for this would have been to better deal with the wind.\nAt about 5:42am, something was clearly going wrong. The ship swung to port, then starboard, port again, starboard again, until finally the bow swung sharply to starboard and smashed into Asia. Because the ship was longer than the canal was wide, she was wedged.\nThere she stayed for six days, plugging a thoroughfare that carries more than 10% of global shipping every day, in an industry that transports 90% of global trade. The general public suddenly noticed that ships were quite important after all, and that hardly anything travels by plane.\nOther ships have got into trouble in Suez. The OOCL Japan lost its steering in 2017 and hit the bank; it destroyed some road and a passing car and was freed in several hours. In 2004, the Russian oil tanker Tropic Brilliance closed the canal for 3 days by getting similarly wedged after mechanical problems.\nAn aerial view on March 27 shows ships waiting in queue in the Gulf of Suez . Photograph: Mahmoud Khaled\/AFP\/Getty Images\nAt first, the prevailing theory given for Ever Given’s plight, by Lt Gen Osama Rabie, chief of the Suez Canal Authority, was “strong winds and a dust storm”. By Saturday, Rabie’s view had changed. Now, the weather could be involved but so could “technical error, or a human error.”\nI nodded at this, thinking back to that snoozing pilot and making assumptions.

{"num":13,"Time":"14 March 2014","Title":"Mechanical v human: Why do planes crash?","Content":"Mechanical v human: Why do planes crash?\nPublished\n14 March 2014\nShare\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nTHINKSTOCK\nBy Finlo Rohrer & Tom de Castella\nBBC News Magazine\nMystery still surrounds the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH 370 but the speculation going on reveals something about lay people's assumptions of air crashes.\nWhat is likely to be the main cause of a passenger plane crashing?\nMechanical failure? Or human error?\nThere are many people whose first assumption - after terrorism or hijacking is discounted - when a plane is lost is that some physical part has failed catastrophically. But mechanical failures alone account for only a small proportion of airliner crashes.\nFor fatal accidents, one calculation puts the primary cause as \"pilot error\" in 50% of all cases.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nAP\nImage caption,\nWreckage from the Sukhoi Superjet 100 crash in Indonesia, 2012\nOne of the most common scenarios for a plane crash (more than a fifth of all fatal accidents between 2006-11, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization) is known as \"controlled flight into terrain\" (CFIT), referring to aircraft that were piloted into the ground, water, mountains or other terrain.\nThe cause could be bad weather leading to poor visibility, a navigation mistake or a more fundamental pilot error. CFIT was coined by aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which argued that pilot error was the most common cause.\nThe most recent confirmed example was the Sukhoi Superjet 100 that crashed into Mount Salak in Indonesia in 2012. The aircraft, which was on a demonstration flight for potential buyers and journalists, had a terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) but this had been switched off by the pilots who assumed the computer was malfunctioning. Unaware that they were near the mountain, the crew were also distracted by conversations with potential buyers in the cockpit. All 45 people on board died.\nAnother egregious example was Eastern Airlines flight 401 which smashed into the Florida Everglades in 1972. The crash happened after all three members of the crew became obsessed with finding why a single indicator light had not come on when the landing gear was lowered. While they investigated, and not noticing that the autopilot had been accidentally switched to a setting that allowed a steady descent, they did not realise they were heading for disaster until it was too late.\nAnother incident in 1978, the crashing of United Airlines flight 173, led to a fundamental change in the way pilots were trained. The captain allowed it to run out of fuel while circling Portland, Oregon. It crashed with the loss of 10 lives. As the fuel was running down, the crew was investigating whether the landing gear had deployed properly after a noticeable jolt and the plane turning to the right.\nThe aftermath led to a heightened recognition of the need for crews to properly communicate and interact as a team, known as Crew Resource Management. If a subordinate notices that fuel is running dangerously low, but for whatever reason does not communicate that to the captain, there is a problem. If the captain ignores a warning from a subordinate about drifting off course, that is a problem.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nAP\nImage caption,\nThe rescue effort following the American Airlines crash in 1979\nPassengers might think of pilot error as a single person's mistakes, but in a team of two or three (and occasionally even four) flyers, errors are compounded within the structure of a team.\nThese team problems can be exacerbated by cultural factors. This was blamed for Korean Air's appalling safety record during the 1980s and 1990s. An excessively hierarchical culture left captains ignoring their subordinates, and the subordinates sometimes afraid to speak up when they had noticed something was wrong. The result was a string of incidents. When Korean Air tackled the cultural issues, improvement was dramatic.\nThere have been CFIT accidents caused by human errors back on the ground. Aeroperu flight 603 crashed into the sea off Peru in 1996 after the instruments stopped working and the computer bombarded the crew with a series of baffling emergency messages. A maintenance worker had forgotten to remove tape from \"static ports\" needed to feed data to the instruments. At night over the sea, it was impossible for the crew to know their altitude and a wing hit the water. All 70 people on board died.\nThere are other crashes that investigators have laid firmly at the door of mechanical or material failure. The deadliest single-plane crash was in 1985 when a Boeing 747, Japan Airlines flight 123, crashed into a mountain, killing 520 people. It was caused by mechanical problems - a badly repaired rear pressure bulkhead ruptured leading to total loss of control.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nThe aftermath of the Tenerife runway accident in 1977\nBut while there are crashes that are manifestly pilot error or manifestly mechanical failure, most experts emphasise that there's usually a range of interconnected and complicated factors that contribute to any crash.\nThe deadliest ever incident happened when two Boeing 747s collided on the runway in Tenerife. The 1977 accident in which 583 people perished occurred in thick fog with limited communication between the control tower and the two planes. It shows the chain of events that leads to accidents, says Graham Braithwaite, professor of safety and accident investigation at Cranfield University.\nIf there hadn't been a bomb attack at nearby Gran Canaria, planes would not have been diverted there, crowding the runway. The airport was built in a place that was prone to sea fog, he notes. The communication system from the control tower to the planes was poor. Sometimes the best people can make the worst mistakes, Braithwaite suggests.\nThe air accident most commonly linked to the current Malaysia Airlines situation happened in June 2009. Air France flight 447, an Airbus A330-200 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean. It took days for the wreckage to be found and three years for the mystery to be solved.\nThe plane had stalled after pilot error. A transcript of the pilots' conversation shows just how confused they had become.\nBut it's possible to see it another way. There was a violent storm which iced over the pitot tubes, or speed sensors, in the build-up to the accident. The autopilot switched itself off, but the pilot - the most junior member of the flight crew - reacted inappropriately to the turbulence the plane was going through.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nThe search for wreckage after the Air France crash of 2009\nAlthough pilot error was clearly the main factor, bad weather and momentary instrument failure contributed to the panic. And what resulted was a failure in crew resource management, the plane stalling and the death of all 228 on board. Critics have pointed to design, and particularly to the feedback from the control sticks as a major factor.\nThe relationship between the pilot and the plane has changed. Computer involvement has steadily increased, automated systems have come to the fore, and the array of sensors has multiplied.\nIt is perhaps understandable that when part of that system is not functioning normally, pilots can be disproportionately unsettled. \"Catastrophic failures don't happen as often but they are more catastrophic when they do. If something went wrong in the 1970s there was a chance you could land it,\" says Joe Pappalardo, senior editor at Popular Mechanics magazine.\nThe pilots in the Air France accident did not do what they should have in the circumstances, particularly with regard to communication between them. But one also has to recognise the bafflement at the situation they found themselves in.\nPilots are extremely well-trained and immensely experienced people by the time they find themselves controlling an airliner, but they are not infallible.\nIt's all too easy to blame pilot error when things go wrong, says aviation writer and light aircraft pilot Sylvia Wrigley, author of Why Planes Crash. \"It's a really, really easy scapegoat. The pilot is either dead or fired. The real problem is a dozen different things have gone wrong.\"\nBut Andrew Brookes, a former RAF pilot who has written about flight safety, says the technology is so good today that pilots are not really necessary. \"The technology exists now for an airliner to fly without a pilot from London to Beijing. Today planes hardly ever fail - I can't think of a [recent] accident caused by engines failing or wings dropping off.\"\nThere's a reason people continue to hold pilots in such an exalted position. \"It goes back to daring young men in their flying machines,\" says Brookes. Pilots look and sound authoritative.\nSome experts disregard the term \"pilot error\" completely, regarding it to be nebulous to the point of uselessness.\nBut the most important thing is that flying is getting safer. In 1985 - the worst year for aviation deaths - there were more than 1,900 fatalities involving airliners. In 2012 there were nine fatal accidents involving airliners causing 372 deaths, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization.\nBut every single accident that is successfully investigated provides data that can be used to improve planes, notes Pappalardo. \"Aviation is still on a learning curve.

At that speed, lift from the horizontal tails exceeded the feather actuator’s ability to prevent a rapid aerodynamic extension of the feather system. The feather extended rapidly without further pilot action or mechanical malfunction.\nSpaceShip Two crash casts doubt on space tourism project, says Branson\nRead more\nPilot Peter Siebold, who survived a 10-mile fall back to earth, was seriously injured in the accident.\nNTSB investigator Katherine Wilson suggested Alsbury might have unlocked the system too early to prevent the flight from being aborted. The feathering system had to be unlocked by Mach 1.8 at the latest, or else the flight would have been aborted.\nThe NTSB said Scaled Composites, the manufacturer of SpaceShipTwo, did not consider the possibility of a pilot unlocking the feathering system too soon, and so did not build safeguards to prevent the accident.\nOn Tuesday, NTSB reiterated safety measures recommended to Scaled Composites.\nVirgin Galactic had previously completed safety measures, including a modification to the feather lock system with an automatic mechanical inhibit to prevent unlocking or locking the feather during safety-critical phases of flight, and a change to the checklist and call-outs the pilots undergo before unlocking the system.An external review team is assessing the safety of Virgin Galactic and the Spaceship Company’s engineering, flight test and operations as well as SpaceShipTwo.\nFollowing the crash in November, Sir Richard Branson said that his dream of commercial space tourism may have ended with the explosion that consumed Virgin Galactic’s test craft above California’s Mojave desert.\nIn a statement, Virgin Galactic said it had begun “safety reviews and a vehicle improvement program prior to the accident” in preparation for the launch of SpaceShipTwo’s commercial service.\n“After the flight test accident, Virgin Galactic assumed full responsibility for the completion of the flight test program and is getting ready for commercial service.”\n“Although we will never forget the tragic loss of Michael Alsbury, with the investigation completed, Virgin Galactic can now focus fully on a strengthened resolve to achieve our goals,” Virgin Group founder Branson said in a statement.\nThis story was amended on 30 July 2015, to clarify that NTSB had not made safety recommendations to Virgin Galactic.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents.

They still might contribute to the Galileo system, with reduced effectiveness, a Commission source said.\nThe EU’s use of a Russian rocket to put the satellites into orbit comes as conflict in Ukraine has strained EU-Russian relations. But EU officials said Arianespace simply selected the rocket best suited to the job.\nAn Arianespace spokesman said the satellites were not guaranteed and the company was not liable to pay compensation to the European Commission for the mishap.\nArianespace uses Soyuz instead of the European Ariane 5 rocket for Galileo because Ariane 5 is much more powerful than the launch needed.

IRGC Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi said the boats had strayed because of a broken navigation system.\nThere were no indications the sailors were harmed while in Iranian custody, the Pentagon said. The quick resolution contrasted with previous cases in which British servicemen were held considerably longer, in one case nearly two weeks.\nIran expects the U.N. nuclear watchdog to confirm on Friday it has curtailed its nuclear programme, paving the way for the unfreezing of billions of dollars of Iranian assets and an end to bans that have crippled oil exports.\nIn a statement carried by state television, the IRGC said the sailors were released in international waters after they apologised.\nIranian state television later released footage of one of the detained men, identified as a U.S. Navy commander, apologising for the incident.\n“It was a mistake, that was our fault, and we apologise for our mistake,” the sailor said on IRIB state TV.\nA Pentagon spokesman, Commander Gary Ross, said the video appeared to be authentic, “but we cannot speak to the conditions of the situation or what the crew was experiencing at the time.”\nA U.S. defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “Clearly this staged video exhibits a sailor making an apology in an unknown context as an effort to defuse a tense situation and protect his crew.”\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden earlier rejected reports that Washington itself had offered Iran an apology over the incident.\nThe incident spilt over into the U.S. presidential campaign, where Republicans are critical of the nuclear deal Iran forged with six world powers and due to take effect soon.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nPentagon: U.S. sailors made 'navigational error' into Iranian waters\nAnxious phone calls, tense moments before Iran's Supreme Leader okayed US sailors' release\nAt a campaign rally, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, who accuses President Barack Obama of being weak on foreign policy, described the detention of the sailors as “an indication of where the hell we’re going”.\nCOOPERATION\nA carefully worded Pentagon statement did not explain how the sailors and their two riverine command boats ended up being detained by Iran, saying only that “the Navy will investigate the circumstances that led to the sailors’ presence in Iran”.\nThe sailors were later taken ashore by U.S. Navy aircraft, while other sailors took charge of the boats and headed towards Bahrain, their original destination.\nA senior U.S. defence official said the circumstances surrounding the incident were still not entirely clear. “We haven’t been able to fully debrief the sailors,” the official said.\nThe sailors were headed to a U.S. military facility in Qatar. Another defence official said the debriefings would begin on Thursday after medical and psychological tests of the sailors on Wednesday.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said he appreciated “the timely way in which this situation was resolved”. He thanked Secretary of State John Kerry for engaging with Iran to secure the sailors’ swift return.\nKerry spoke to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at least five times by phone, U.S. and Iranian officials said.\nAppealing for the sailors’ quick release, Kerry told Zarif: “We can make this into what will be a good story for both of us,” according to a senior State Department official. He repeated that message in follow-up calls, the official said.\nIran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered an immediate investigation to determine whether the U.S. sailors had deliberately sailed into Iranian waters, and ultimately had the final say in their release, Iranian officials said.\nSlideshow ( 11 images )\nZarif said on Twitter that he was “happy to see dialogue and respect, not threats and impetuousness, swiftly resolved the sailors episode”.\nKerry thanked Iran.\n“I think we can all imagine how a similar situation might have played out three or four years ago, and the fact that today this kind of issue can be resolved peacefully and efficiently is a testament to the critical role diplomacy plays in keeping our country safe, secure, and strong,” Kerry said.\nFour photographs published by Shargh Daily, a Tehran newspaper, and posted on Twitter, purportedly show the moments after one of the U.S. boats was stopped by the IRGC.\nIranian state television released footage of the arrest, showing the sailors as they knelt down with hands behind their heads and their two vessels being surrounded by several IRGC fast boats.\nSlideshow ( 11 images )\nThe video showed weapons and ammunition confiscated from the sailors, who were seen eating food provided by the Iranians. There were also images of American passports being inspected.\nThe incident raised tensions between Iran and the United States, which, along with other world powers, reached the deal under which Iran will curb its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\nSome conservatives in both countries, enemies since Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution, have criticised the deal that is due to be implemented in the coming days.\nNUCLEAR DEAL\nIran’s armed forces chief, Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, said the incident should demonstrate Iranian strength to “troublemakers” in the U.S. Congress, which has sought to put pressure on Iran after the nuclear deal.\nAttributing the boats’ incursion into Iranian waters to a navigation error marked a de-escalation in rhetoric. Earlier, the Guards had said the boats were “snooping” in Iranian territory and Zarif had demanded an apology from Washington.\nThe IRGC, the Islamic Republic’s praetorian guard, is highly suspicious of U.S. military activity near Iran’s borders and many senior officers suspect Washington of pursuing regime change in Tehran.\nThe Guards operate land and naval units separate from the regular armed forces and stage frequent war games in the Gulf, which separates Iran from its regional rival Saudi Arabia and a U.S. naval base in Bahrain.\nLast month, the U.S. Navy said an IRGC vessel fired unguided rockets near the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical shipping route for crude oil that connects the Gulf to the Indian Ocean. Iran denied the vessel had done so.\nIn April 2015, the Guards seized a container ship belonging to Maersk, one of the world’s major shipping lines, in the Gulf because of a legal dispute between the company and Iran. The ship and its 24 crew members were released after 10 days.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin, Susan Heavey, Phil Stewart, Jonathan Landay, Andrea Shalal, Warren Strobel and Matt Spetalnick; Writing by Sam Wilkin and Peter Cooney; Editing by Howard Goller and Sandra Maler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it mentions that the U.S. Navy patrol boats had strayed into Iranian territorial waters due to a broken navigation system.

Nevertheless, the human dimension is still vital.\n“All these gizmos are aids to navigation and it does not absolve you, as master, from taking responsibility for exercising good seamanship which is constant monitoring of your position accurately and making reference to all available material including printed charts and the local knowledge of the area,” said John Dalby, chief executive with specialists Marine Risk Management.\n“At all times the master is responsible for the safe navigation of a ship, and he ultimately bears the risk responsibility here.”\nThe operator of 114,500-ton Costa Concordia said the captain’s actions had caused the tragedy in which at least six people died.\nDalby said there were also questions about whether there were enough qualified crew with maritime experience on board, rather than staff whose role was in passenger hospitality.\n“In a situation where you are in confined waters, things can happen very, very quickly; faster than a GPS can refresh or be referred to,” he said.\nPier Luigi Foschi, chairman and chief executive of Costa Crociere, which operates the Costa Concordia said on Monday the crew responded adequately “given the circumstances in line with the training and instruction they have received.”\nFoschi said the ship had deviated from the correct route when it hit rocks near the coast, tearing a large hole in the hull, and that the captain had contravened company safety procedures.\n“The only thing I can repeat is that was not the ordinary route that the ship was taking at the time,” he said.\nThe captain denies being too close to the coast and says the rock he hit was not marked on charts.\nSAFETY AT SEA\nOther maritime experts said a combination of human and technical errors were likely to have contributed.\n“An error chain is where several things have gone wrong,” said Len Holder, former master of the Honourable Company of Master Mariners industry association.\n“Looking at the Herald of Free Enterprise, several things went wrong, none of which should have caused the accident but when they all came up together that is where the problems occurred,” he said referring to a British car ferry disaster in which 193 people were killed.\nU.N. shipping agency the International Maritime Organization (IMO) said if necessary it would re-examine safety regulations for large cruise liners pending the outcome of investigations.\nCruise ship safety measures are regulated by IMO conventions.\n“It is important to recognize that the last century has seen an astonishing growth in legislation on the safety of shipping,” a senior ship industry source said.\n“Marine accidents are now rare events when the thousands of voyages undertaken annually in often appalling weather are taken into account. Certainly no more regulation is required but a focus on application and compliance may be something that the IMO will consider.”\nIMO Secretary-General Koji Sekimizu said the outcome of the investigations should not be pre-judged, adding that the agency should not take the accident lightly, adding that the causes of the incident were still not established.\n“We should seriously consider the lessons to be learnt and, if necessary, re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation,” he said on Monday.\nOthers said the disaster could encourage more rigorous training of crews.\n“In the immediate future aftermath if there is a higher emphasis on the inspection of cruise ships, that maybe focused towards the training and qualifications of the navigating crew and the crew that is assisting with emergency responses in terms of helping passengers,” said Ted Thompson, with the industry Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA).\nSome maritime specialists say the growing size of cruise liners has posed risks in the event of a sinking.\n“The problem with the big ones tends to be getting people off safely if there is an incident,” said Holder, who is also chairman of maritime training company Videotel.\nIndustry officials say size was not an issue.\n“Different ships are built for different markets, different routes but every cruise ship is built to operate or is certified to operate around the globe,” said Robert Ashdown, technical, environment and operations director for the European Cruise Council, the umbrella group for cruise companies.\n“These ships routinely face the worst that nature can throw at them, whether it’s the Bay of Biscay in December or whether it’s a Caribbean tropical storm or the high seas of the Antarctic ocean. These ships are stable in those conditions and they are safe.”\nCLIA’s Thompson said new cruise liners were fitted with propeller systems that enabled more maneuverability.\n“To actually turn a ship .. is much more quickly done than in the past,” he said. “This is such a one-off event, passengers can and should feel safe cruising on modern cruise ships.”\nAdditional reporting by Paul Sandle and Drazen Jorgic\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it discusses the possible reasons for a cruise liner disaster, specifically the Costa Concordia disaster in Italy.

{"num":48,"Time":"Thu 12 Aug 2010 22.00 CEST","Title":"Revealed: NHS fails to curb lethal painkiller errors","Content":"Health workers made more than 1,300 mistakes involving the use of strong painkilling drugs in less than a year, resulting in at least three deaths and severe harm to two other patients, the Guardian can reveal.\nNearly one in five dosage errors involving morphine, diamorphine and similar opiate drugs resulted in some harm to NHS patients.\nFigures released under a Guardian Freedom of Information request show mistakes in England and Wales continue at a high level despite the publicity that followed the Guardian's revelation in May last year about the death of David Gray. The 70-year-old died at his home in Cambridgeshire when he was injected with a tenfold overdose of diamorphine by Daniel Ubani, a locum GP who had flown in from Germany that day.\nThe official report into the incident last month revealed two other GPs hired, like Ubani, by Take Care Now – a now-defunct company that was then providing some out of hours services for the NHS – had been involved in non-fatal diamorphine overdoses the year before.\nThe breakdown of the new figures suggest lessons have not been learned, with little change in the numbers of people harmed by medication errors involving this class of drugs despite several official safety warnings.\nDavid Gray's son, Rory, called the new figures \"unbelievable\". \"Taken at face value [they] suggest nothing has been made safer with regards to opiate medicines at all. Whilst there is no accountability then it seems there will continue to be no effective measures put in place to stop these unnecessary and avoidable deaths.\"\nThe charity Action against Medical Accidents (AvMA) said the statistics were shocking and \"confirm our worst fears about not implementing patient safety alerts\".\nIn its own research, coincidentally being published at the same timetoday, the organisation accuses hospitals and other care providers of killing and injuring patients by not complying with official directives from the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) intended to protect those receiving care.\nHowever, safety experts point out that the numbers of patients being treated by such drugs is rising, so the proportion of mistakes may be going down.\nBoth the NPSA, established in 2003 to help the NHS learn from its mistakes, and the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the health service regulator, insisted things were improving, although notifying the two bodies over drug and other errors that resulted in death or severe harm only became mandatory on 1 April this year.\nThe NPSA received a total of 4,223 cases involving opiate drugs between November 2004 and June 2008. Of these, 3,338 were recorded as causing no harm, 629 low harm, 242 moderate harm and four severe harm. Five patients died. There was insufficient data on five other cases. Figures from May 2009 to April this year show 1,329 cases, 1,078 said to have resulted in no harm, 179 low harm, 67 moderate, and two severe. Three patients died.\nLinda Hutchinson, CQC director, said: \"Unfortunately we will never be able to eliminate human error from healthcare, but the risks can be minimised. That is why it is so important that NHS trusts and other health providers report incidents, thoroughly investigate them and make changes to stop the same mistakes happening again. They should also implement changes as a result of safety alerts. Had Take Care Now done this, it is possible that Mr Gray would still be alive today.\n\"The increase in reporting is a good thing. We often find it is the NHS trusts reporting a high number of incidents that are doing a better job of investigating them and taking action to prevent them happening again.\"\nThe NPSA said its reporting system was one of the most sophisticated in the world: \"We gather patient safety incidents, analyse them for trends and use these as a platform on which to produce patient safety alerts and guidance for the NHS.\n\"It is evident the reporting culture in the NHS has improved with over 1 million incidents [relating to drugs, medical and surgical procedures] reported each year. The majority of incidents reported to us in relation to diamorphine and other opiates result in low or no harm to the patient. In addition, most of these do not relate to mis-selection of injectable diamorphine or morphine.\"\nThe agency believed it was now told of the \"vast majority\" of serious incidents.\nThe revelations come as hospitals and other providers of care are accused by AvMA of killing and injuring patients by not complying with official directives from the NPSA intended to protect those receiving care. Dozens of hospitals, mental health trusts and primary care trusts are failing to implement patient safety alerts from the agency, despite the Department of Health writing to them reminding them to do so.\nSome 29 NHS organisations had not put at least 10 alerts into action by 7 June, on issues such as drugs and oxygen, even though with some, the deadline for compliance was several years earlier, according to AvMA: \"It is impossible not to conclude that lives are being put at unnecessary risk and it is likely that avoidable injuries or deaths are still being caused as a result of trusts not complying,\" it says.\nPublic health minister Anne Milton said: \"Across the NHS there must be a culture of patient safety above all else. We have set out how we intend to free NHS staff from central control and targets that are not clinically justified to allow them to focus on what really matters – reliable, effective and above all safe care for each patient.\"\nDaniel Ubani case\nDavid Gray, 70, died at his home in Manea, Cambridgeshire, shortly after he was injected by a huge overdose of the painkiller diamorphine in February 2008. The doctor involved, Daniel Ubani, was on this first shift in the UK, having flown in from Germany, the day before. He admitted in a letter to the Gray family that he had been tired, stressed and unfamiliar with the drug.\nThe official inquiry into the case, completed only last month, revealed that two other doctors from Germany working for the same private company providing NHS with out-of-hours GP services, but in neighbouring Suffolk, had been involved in incidents of diamorphine overdoses the previous year. Though neither was fatal, one patient required resuscitation in hospital A&E and the other was unconscious when an ambulance arrived at their home.\nThe Gray case only became public knowledge in May last year when the Guardian began uncovering fundamental questions over out-of-hours services, regulation of doctors, drug safety and even the judicial systems of Germany and the UK.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it highlights a series of medical errors involving the use of strong painkilling drugs, including morphine and diamorphine, within the NHS.

{"num":43,"Time":"Thu 4 Dec 2014 13.31 CET","Title":"Revealed: 100 safety breaches at UK labs handling potentially deadly diseases","Content":"H\nigh-security laboratories that handle the most dangerous viruses and bacteria have reported more than 100 accidents or near-misses to safety regulators in the past five years, official reports reveal.\nOne blunder led to live anthrax being sent from a government facility to unsuspecting labs across the UK, a mistake that exposed other scientists to the disease. Another caused the failure of an air handling system that helped contain foot and mouth disease at a large animal lab.\nWear and tear also caused problems and potentially put researchers in danger. At a top security Ministry of Defence lab, tears were found in isolation suits at a facility handling animals infected with the Ebola virus.\nReports obtained by the Guardian from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) reveal that more than 70 incidents at government, university and hospital labs were serious enough to investigate. Many led to enforcement letters, or crown prohibition notices (CPN), ordering labs to shut until improvements were made. Some were so serious they ended in legal action.\nAnthrax cells. Photograph: Alamy\nProf Richard Ebright, a US biosafety expert at Rutgers University in New Jersey, who reviewed the reports for the Guardian, said that, taken together, they revealed failures in procedures, infrastructure, training and safety culture at some British labs.\nAlarmed at a run of incidents at facilities that work on animal diseases, Ebright asked: “Does British agriculture have a death wish?”\nThe figures amount to one investigation every three weeks at secure laboratories that are designed to carry out research on pathogens that can cause serious illness and spread into the community. Some of the organisms are lethal and have no vaccines or treatments.\nMany of the incidents were one-off, almost inevitable human mistakes, such as spillages of infectious bugs. Others were down to old equipment and safety clothing. The most serious accidents arose from chains of mistakes that happened one after the other, and were often only discovered later.\nThe reports compiled by the HSE describe at least 116 incidents and 75 completed investigations since April 2010 at laboratories where the most dangerous organisms are handled. Other investigations are under way, but the HSE cannot disclose details of those in case they lead to legal action. All of the investigations were prompted by reports from lab managers who are obliged by law to tell the HSE when an accident or near-miss happens at their facility.\nBackstory\nThe Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey. Photograph: Rex Features\nSome of the most worrisome incidents happened at the Surrey-based Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), renamed the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) in October. In one case, scientists were handling anthrax when something went badly wrong. They meant to send harmless samples, killed by heat, to nearby AHVLA labs and others in York and Belfast. But somehow the tubes got mixed up. Instead of sending out dead material, the anthrax they sent was live and dangerous.\nThe staff who made the mistake were safe enough. They worked in a high-security lab built to contain lethal agents. But some of those who received the bugs did not. In Belfast, the anthrax was handled in a higher containment lab, meaning those staff were safe. In York, the samples were never opened. But at another AHVLA site, scientists opened the tubes in a less secure lab and got to work on the open bench. The incident at the AHVLA is one of the more serious biological accidents that has happened in the UK in recent years. But it was far from being the only one.\nHuman error\nThe HSE documents cast light on the endless ways that safety can be undermined at UK high-containment labs, where crucial research takes place into dangerous infections. Poor management, inadequate training, inappropriate procedures, equipment failures, human error and plain bad luck all come into play. Some incidents cannot be avoided. Humans will always make mistakes. Equipment will always break. But others are more troubling and result from multiple safety breaches, rather than single mistakes.\nThe anthrax incident at the AHVLA happened in May 2012 and drew an immediate CPN. That shut the lab so no more live anthrax could be sent out. The timing was ironic. The government had spent months stockpiling anthrax vaccines in case terrorists released the bug at the London Olympics. Now one of their own labs had put people at risk.\nThe HSE investigation found that two unsuspecting staff at the AHVLA were exposed to the deadly bug, though both had been vaccinated and neither fell ill. The incident received little attention. In the agency’s 2012-13 annual report, one line refers to the clampdown. It states: “CPN – labelling and tracking of biological materials inadequate – now resolved”.\nAmerican blunder\nTom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the Atlanta security lapse was a wakeup call. Photograph: Johnny Clark\/AP\nThe AHVLA incident bears a close similarity to a blunder in June that received global attention. Scientists in a high-security lab at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, failed to kill batches of anthrax bacteria properly and sent them to other labs. Tom Frieden, the head of the CDC, told a House oversight committee that the incident was a “wake-up call”. Tim Murphy, the Republican chair, was unimpressed: “It was a potentially very dangerous failure,” he said.\nThe AHVLA has made dangerous slips before. Last year, the lab received a crown censure for nine safety lapses that exposed staff to live Mycobacterium bovis, an organism that causes TB in cattle but can cause serious illness and even death in humans.\nOver a two-year period, from 2009 to 2011, 3,700 samples were sent from one AHVLA lab to another without managers knowing the organisms were still viable. Minutes of the crown censure hearing reveal an alarming picture. Staff had been given the wrong equipment to destroy the bacteria and were not trained in the right procedure. Management had failed to act when staff raised concerns. One person later tested positive for the infection.\nExpert analysis\nEbright, who testified to the House committee over the CDC anthrax incident, was struck by the similar failings at labs in the UK and the US. “The incidents at the AHVLA should really not occur. They involved not one error, but a whole chain of errors, and they are all essentially unforgiveable,” he said. “They reflect the most elementary lapses and they are potentially very serious. To see them happening like that suggests there is a deep problem.”\nColourised scanning electron micrograph of filamentous Ebola virus particles. Photograph: Alamy\nProf Brian Spratt, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College, London, echoed Ebright’s concerns. Sending out bovine TB, an organism that can infect people, posed a clear risk of infection, he said. “Sending anthrax to other labs incorrectly, believing it to be inactivated, is also clearly very serious with a real possibility of infection of recipient laboratory workers,” he told the Guardian. “What strikes me is that accidents do happen even in the best facilities, often due to operator error, or unrecognised breakdowns in containment measures.”\nUK labs that study infectious organisms are rated by their containment level (CL). The higher the level, the more barriers there are to prevent the escape of pathogens. If one fails, the next should ensure there is no danger. CL1 and CL2 labs work on fairly benign bugs. More dangerous pathogens, such as those that cause anthrax, the plague and rabies, can be handled in secure CL3 labs. The most dangerous and often exotic organisms, such as Ebola, Marburg and Lassa viruses must be handled in CL4 labs. These bugs can kill, spread easily, and are often untreatable. The reports obtained from the HSE deal with incidents at CL3 and CL4 labs.\nBritish labs\nBritain has about 600 CL3 labs. Nine sites, all in south-east England, are home to CL4 labs, including the National Institute for Medical Research, which studies pandemic and avian flu, and the Ministry of Defence’s Porton Down lab, which studies Ebola and other pathogens that could be used as biological weapons.\nThe Institute for Animal Health (IAH), renamed the Pirbright Institute in 2012, has been handed eight enforcement letters since April 2010, more than any other single facility. Photograph: Alessia Pierdomenico\/Reuters\nThe HSE documents reveal that one high-security lab, the Pirbright Institute (formerly the Institute for Animal Health), has been handed eight enforcement letters since April 2010. The Surrey lab is a world-class centre for animal virus surveillance. It studies foot and mouth disease, bluetongue, rinderpest and other infections. But it has a tainted reputation: the 2007 foot and mouth outbreak was traced to a leak from Pirbright’s drains. Scientists at the lab worked on the outbreak strain, but the virus was made in huge volumes by Merial, a vaccine manufacturer at the site.\nIn the wake of the outbreak, the Commons science and technology committee held an inquiry into biosecurity at UK research labs. Their report, published in 2008, stated: “It is critical such an incident does not happen again.” But near-misses are common at Pirbright.\nIn April, Pirbright managers pleaded guilty to eight breaches of safety legislation around foot and mouth experiments. The incidents happened in November 2012 and January 2013 when a ventilation system used to keep the lab at negative pressure – to prevent viruses escaping – was modified. The system failed, as did an alarm that should have warned staff of the danger. No virus escaped in the incident.\nMore incidents followed. The HSE investigated at least four more times at Pirbright since the lapses that led to their prosecution. Some were fairly minor, including the spillage of foot and mouth virus outside a safety cabinet. But in February, the lab had another problem with air circulation in a facility for cattle with foot and mouth disease. This time, high winds knocked the system out for two-and-a-half hours.\nSpratt, who in 2007 wrote an independent review for government on biosafety at UK labs that handle foot and mouth, said the malfunctioning of the ventilation system could have been dangerous. “The air handling incident in the large-animal facility at Pirbright is potentially serious as, if foot and mouth disease virus from infected livestock was released outside the facility, exposure of livestock on neighbouring farms is a real possibility,” he said.\nIn January, scientists at Pirbright will move into new labs, the result of more than £100m refurbishment at the site. That could solve many of the problems the facility has had with failing equipment. But Ebright still has concerns. Some Pirbright incidents point to bad practice and moving labs will not change that, he said. More seriously, he questions whether Pirbright should still be allowed to work on the foot and mouth disease virus. “Is there an economic case that offsets the risk posed by their work, particularly with their sorry record of safety? To my mind, the answer is no,” he said.\nPirbright argues that major benefits come from its research. A statement from the lab said it played a crucial role in controlling and eliminating viral diseases of farm animals and viruses that can spread from animals to humans. Scientists there played a major role in eradicating rinderpest, saving African countries £1bn a year. Its work will lead to safer and cheaper foot and mouth vaccines, and greater understanding of bluetongue virus, which it helped eradicate from the UK in 2007, saving £500m a year, the statement said.\nOn Pirbright’s prosecution, the statement conceded that the lab “acknowledged its weaknesses in the area of activity involved and has reviewed and reformed its operational processes to ensure an incident such as this could not happen again”.\nIt continued: “The institute operates in a highly regulated and complex environment. Staff are actively encouraged to report incidents internally to allow us to learn lessons and improve. Any spills or leaks, or issues affecting the multiple and layered biosecurity systems, are reported to the regulators and classified by them as a dangerous occurrence. The reporting of such an incident does not mean there is any risk of release of virus to the environment as there are multiple layers of containment to ensure this does not happen,”\nSolutions\nThe problems at the AHVLA, now the APHA, may be tougher to solve though. “As long as the management remains, the same problems will recur,” Ebright said. “You either close the facility, redirect it or rebuild it, starting with new management. It’s not the managers who send out putatively inactivated anthrax, but they have allowed that to happen. There has to be accountability all the way to the top.”\nA researcher analyses viral and bacterial contamination at the MoD’s Porton Down lab in Wiltshire. Photograph: Martin Argles\/Guardian\nLabs that report the most incidents may not be the most lax. One factor that affects the number of reports – and investigations – is how professional staff are at reporting near-misses. A culture of blame makes people hide their mistakes and crucial lessons go unlearned.\nTom Inglesby, director of health security at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said: “It’s very important that scientists are not punished for reporting accidents or near-accidents. That kind of punitive response will create pressures to not report. In other safety cultures, like airline safety, pilots are punished if they do not report near-misses, but not when they do report.”\nThe HSE investigated two incidents at the MoD’s Porton Down lab near Salisbury last year. They both involved splits in isolation suits. One was at a facility housing marmosets infected with Ebola virus. The tears were reported and the damaged parts replaced. “You will get tears in safety suits. People will spill things. Those kinds of accidents are unavoidable. If they are immediately corrected and reported, the people should be rewarded. They certainly shouldn’t be punished,” said Ebright. “That’s how the system should work.”\nRichard Daniels, head of the HSE’s biological agents unit, said the safety of UK labs was good, if not perfect. He said the regulator urged lab directors to focus on their vulnerabilities and to improve safety by bringing in fresh measures to assess how well their staff were trained, and how well their equipment was maintained. “With the likes of large organisations, Pirbright, APHA and others, we expect leadership to come from the top, because that sets the culture and the expectations below it. The danger is that if you don’t look at these things proactively, complacency can perhaps affect an organisation, because you haven’t got anything to tell you that things are going awry,” he said.\nInglesby said: “Every lab system, whether university, government or private sector, should make it absolutely clear to its scientists that laboratory safety is a top priority and should be built in to every practice, not an add on, or a checkbox.”\nA BIS spokesperson said: “We take any breach of security and safety procedures in animal disease testing facilities very seriously. In these instances, there was no risk to the public and no viruses were released. Health and safety procedures at Pirbright have been strengthened and the BBSRC [Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council] have invested millions of pounds into facilities including the National Virology Centre, which boasts a brand new state-of-the-art high laboratory facility. An independent review was commissioned to promote the development of robust, effective systems and work practices at Pirbright and ensure public safety”.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which funded the AHVLA and now the APHA, said on Thursday afternoon:“UK animal disease laboratories are nationally and internationally recognised for their expertise, playing a crucial role in the swift diagnosis of notifiable disease, as shown in the recent avian flu outbreak. As with any laboratory, improvements in procedures are continually made and we always follow HSE advice.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it discusses safety breaches and incidents at high-security laboratories, some of which involve human error, equipment failures, and lapses in safety procedures.

Alphabet stock slid by 9% during regular trading in the US but was flat after hours.\nExperts pointed out that promotional material for Bard, Google’s competitor to Microsoft-backed ChatGPT, contained an error in the response by the chatbot to: “What new discoveries from the James Webb space telescope (JWST) can I tell my nine-year old about?”\n‘ChatGPT needs a huge amount of editing’: users’ views mixed on AI chatbot\nRead more\nBard’s response – in a video demo posted online – includes an answer suggesting the JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth’s solar system, or exoplanets.\nThe error was picked up by experts including Grant Tremblay, an astrophysicist at the US Center for Astrophysics, who tweeted: “Not to be a ~well, actually~ jerk, and I’m sure Bard will be impressive, but for the record: JWST did not take ‘the very first image of a planet outside our solar system’”.\nNot to be a ~well, actually~ jerk, and I'm sure Bard will be impressive, but for the record: JWST did not take \"the very first image of a planet outside our solar system\".\n\nthe first image was instead done by Chauvin et al.

Bard has been released to a team of specialist testers and has yet to be rolled out to the public.\n“This highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something that we’re kicking off this week with our trusted tester program,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”\nHow will Google and Microsoft AI chatbots affect us and how we work?\nRead more\nBard is based on a so-called large language AI model, a type of neural network, which mimics the underlying architecture of the brain in computer form. It is fed vast amounts of text from the internet in a process that teaches it how to generate responses to text-based prompts. However, this can also lead to the chatbot repeating errors from the information that it absorbs.\nBard is an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA.

A day earlier, Microsoft held an event in which it announced that it was launching a public version of its Bing search with ChatGPT functions integrated.\nGil Luria, a senior software analyst at DA Davidson, said: “While Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product.\n“Google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on search and that caused the announcement to be rushed and the embarrassing mess-up of posting a wrong answer during their demo.”\nAlphabet, whose main business is Google, is coming off a disappointing fourth quarter as advertisers cut spending. Microsoft is a key backer of the company behind ChatGPT, the San Francisco-based OpenAI, and its move to integrate ChatGPT technology into its products including search has forced Google, also a big investor in AI, to take action.\n“People are starting to question: is Microsoft going to be a formidable competitor now against Google’s really bread-and-butter business?” said King Lip, the chief strategist at BakerAvenue Wealth Management, which owns Alphabet and Microsoft shares.\nLip cautioned that concerns about Alphabet may be overblown, saying: “I think still Bing is a far, far cry away from Google’s search capabilities.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents as it mentions an error made by Google's new artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, Bard.

Thirty staff, patients and assistants were killed and 37 injured in one of the worst incidents of civilian casualties in the 14-year war.\nThe US military said on Wednesday that the report demonstrated its commitment to accountability and that some of those most closely involved had been suspended from duty pending disciplinary action. But MSF dismissed it as raising more questions than answers and blamed the frightening catalogue of mistakes on “gross negligence”.\nKunduz hospital attack: how a US military ‘mistake’ left 22 dead\nRead more\nThe medical charity has previously condemned the airstrike as a “war crime” and demanded an international investigation. The US has been accused of changing its version of events four times in the days after the incident, which is now the subject of three inquiries – by the US, Nato and Afghanistan.\nThe military’s findings were presented by Gen John Campbell, the US commander in Afghanistan. “The strike began at 2.08am,” he said. “At 2.20am an SOF [special operations forces] officer at Bagram [airbase] received a call from MSF advising that their facility was under attack. It took the headquarters and the US special operations commander until 2.37am to realise the fatal mistake. At that time the AC-130 had already ceased firing. The strike lasted for approximately 29 minutes. This is an example of human process error.”\nMSF has said it repeatedly gave the US military the GPS coordinates of its trauma centre to ensure it would not be targeted, most recently on 29 September. Campbell did not dispute this, blaming human error compounded by technical malfunctions and procedural failings.\nMSF shocked after Kunduz hospital strike report shows gross negligence – video Guardian\nHe detailed a series of blunders that ended in tragedy. The aircraft took off without a normal mission brief or essential materials such as no-strike designations, which would have identified the location of the MSF centre.\nDuring the flight, the onboard electronic systems malfunctioned, preventing command-and-control operations and limiting the ability to send email or video. In addition, as it arrived in Kunduz, it also mistakenly reported that the aircraft had been targeted by a missile, putting it off course, and in turn degrading the accuracy of some targeting systems.\nEven when these were corrected, the crew remained “fixated” on the physical description of their original target, Campbell admitted, even though there were some “contradictory indicators”.\nThe crew of the AC-130 gunship relied on a physical description of the compound provided by Afghan forces, which led the crew to attack the wrong target on 2 October. It said the intended target, thought to be under Taliban control and being used in part as a prison, was 450 metres away from the hospital.\nMSF hospital airstrike: who are the victims?\nRead more\nThe aircraft fired 211 shells at the compound. MSF said this month in its own report that several doctors and nurses were killed immediately, and patients who could not move burned to death in the ensuing fire. Hospital staff members made 18 attempts to call or text US and Afghan authorities, the group said.\nCampbell told a press conference: “The medical facility was misidentified as a target by US personnel who believed they were striking a different building several hundred metres away where there were reports of combatants.\n“The personnel who requested the strike and those who executed it from the air did not undertake appropriate measures to verify that the facility was a legitimate military target.”\nHe added: “Based upon the information learned during the investigation, the report determined that the proximate cause of this tragedy was the direct result of avoidable human error, compounded by process and equipment failures.\n“In addition the report found fatigue and a high operational tempo contributed to this tragedy,” he said.\nChristopher Stokes, the general director of MSF, stands at the gate of the organisation’s hospital, after it was hit by a U.S. airstrike, in Kunduz, Afghanistan Photograph: Najim Rahim\/AP\n“It also identified failures in systems and processes that, while not the cause of the strike on the MSF trauma centre, contributed to the incident. These included the loss of electronic communications systems on the aircraft, the nature of the planning and approval process employed during operations in Kunduz city, and the lack of a single system to vet proposed targets against a no-strike list.\n“We have reviewed each of these failures and implemented corrections as appropriate. We have learned from this terrible incident … This was a tragic mistake. US forces would never intentionally strike a hospital or other protected facilities.”\nMSF gave a lukewarm reception to the findings. Christopher Stokes, its general director, said: “The US version of events presented today leaves MSF with more questions than answers. It is shocking that an attack can be carried out when US forces have neither eyes on a target nor access to a no-strike list, and have malfunctioning communications systems.\nKunduz hospital patients 'burned in beds … even wars have rules', says MSF chief\nRead more\n“It appears that 30 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of people are denied life-saving care in Kunduz simply because the MSF hospital was the closest large building to an open field and ‘roughly matched’ a description of an intended target.”\nHe added: “The frightening catalogue of errors outlined today illustrates gross negligence on the part of US forces and violations of the rules of war. The destruction of a protected facility without verifying the target – in this case a functioning hospital full of medical staff and patients – cannot only be dismissed as individual human error or breaches of the US rules of engagement.\n“MSF reiterates its call for an independent and impartial investigation into the attack on our hospital in Kunduz. Investigations of this incident cannot be left solely to parties to the conflict in Afghanistan.”\nFollowing the earlier press conference, Campbell did not take questions, handing over to Brig Gen Wilson Shoffner, who refused to comment on whether Campbell would consider his position or whether an independent international investigation should be conducted.\nShoffner said the investigators interviewed 65 witnesses and produced 3,000 pages. “The investigation found that some of the US individuals involved did not follow the rules of engagement,” he said, adding: “We made a terrible mistake that led to unnecessary deaths.\n“We will do everything possible to prevent this happening again,” he said. “We would never, ever do anything to unnecessarily harm innocent civilians.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it describes a tragic incident involving a US military aircraft, an AC-130 gunship, firing on a medical center full of doctors and civilians, mistaking it for a Taliban-controlled building several hundred meters away.

Four Down's syndrome babies were also born to mothers who had been told their tests put them in the low-risk group.\nThe inquiry also recommended that the computer model which failed should be re-examined by the NHS and replaced if it was considered too simple. The report called for extra training for staff in more sophisticated monitoring of Down's syndrome risks.\nThe investigation followed the belated discovery of the computer error at the Northern general hospital in Sheffield, where tests on samples from the women started on January 4 last year, less than a week after the NHS's intensive anti-millennium bug preparations for 2000 were completed. The team's 112-page report found that a dating mistake continued until tests carried out on May 24 that year, when it was finally spotted.\nThe report, commissioned by Lindsey Davies, regional director of public health, also found that checks and monitoring of the Northern general's PathLAN computer system had become complacent. It said: \"In part, the fact that the service had run successfully for 10 years led to a degree of overconfidence in the processes used and the software which contributed to the warning signs being overlooked and accommodated as acceptable errors.\"\nThe blunder affected women from South Yorkshire and the east Midlands, an area served by nine hospitals which sent samples to the Northern general. Professor Davies said yesterday: \"It was very specifically related to the millennium. When the computer got to 2000 it just didn't calculate the mother's age correctly.\n\"When that information was fed into the test's calculations, the resulting risk level was wrong. It just demonstrates how careful you have to be at every stage in the system.\"\nThe tests were not a guarantee against babies proving to have Down's syndrome, but placing in the high risk category would have given mothers the opportunity to have an amniocentesis test.\nProf Davies said: \"When the results started to look strange the hospital staff just thought it was a different mixture of women coming through, rather than the computer software. The hospital NHS trust was reassured - they thought everything was fine.\n\"But this was a simple error that shouldn't have happened.\"\nAndrew Cash, chief executive of Sheffield teaching hospitals trust, apologised yesterday to all the women given misleading results. He said: \"They were put in the unacceptable position of being given reassurance by the test and then having that taken away from them. We are already taking steps to ensure to the greatest possible extent that errors of this nature cannot happen again, and these will now be reinforced by the recommendations in the report.\"\nThe trust has replaced computer laboratory software at all Sheffield hospitals since the error was discovered.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is about a significant incident related to a computer error that affected the healthcare system.

{"num":61,"Time":"Updated 8:32 AM EDT, Fri March 17, 2023","Title":"US airplane near misses keep coming. Now officials are talking about averting ‘catastrophic’ incidents","Content":"CNN\n — \nThe skies have been turbulent over the United States in 2023 – and not just because of rogue balloons.\nSince the start of the year, there have been a concerning number of high-profile “near misses” as planes involved in airport landing or taking off procedures came perilously close to potential disaster.\nAnd then there’s the turbulence. As all flyers know, bumpy air is a regular feature of plane travel, but not usually, as has been experienced recently, to the violent extent that passengers are hurt.\nPlus, details emerged of an incident late last year, in which a United Airlines Boeing 777 plunged toward the Pacific Ocean for 21 seconds just after takeoff, apparently pulling up just 800 feet over the Pacific Ocean as passengers screamed in fear.\nThe litany of incidents that have clocked up less than three months into 2023 have prompted such concern that this week the US Federal Aviation Administration convened a “Safety Summit.”\nOf course, flying remains an incredibly safe way to travel. Commercial plane crashes are nowadays very rare, with approximately 45,000 flights typically completed each day in the US, all without fatality. That’s a number that continues to rise, post Covid.\nSo, given that the FAA has assembled aviation experts – and US Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg – to take a closer look at what’s going on in the US, should passengers be worried?\nWhile officials, still investigating these incidents, and airlines say flyers can continue to board planes with the confidence that the industry’s rigorous safety procedures will keep them out of harm’s way, some say recent events are a warning sign of potential trouble to come.\n“These recent incidents must serve as a wake-up call for every single one of us, before something more catastrophic occurs. Before lives are lost,” National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said to government and industry leaders gathered for the summit on Wednesday.\nAmerican Airlines planes are parked on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix in this file photo.\nA string of scary near misses\nOn paper, it has not been a great year, thanks mainly to the series of headline-making “runway incursions” – essentially near misses between aircraft that made headlines and prompted serious questions about aviation risks.\nOn January 13, an American Airlines jet crossed a runway at New York’s JFK International Airport as a Delta Air Lines aircraft was taking off.\nTen days later, a United Airlines jet crossed a runway at Honolulu’s Daniel K. Inouye International Airport as a cargo aircraft was coming in to land. At their closest, says the FAA, the two were 1,170 feet apart.\nFebruary saw a rash of incidents. At California’s Burbank Airport, a Mesa Airlines plane had to make a go-around – essentially an aborted landing – when its crew realized a SkyWest plane was taking off from the same runway. Another go-around incident occurred at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport in Florida.\nPerhaps closest to disaster was an incident on February 4, when FedEx cargo pilots were landing at Austin, only to see a Southwest plane was on the runway, about to take off.\nAir Traffic Control had cleared both planes, despite the airport being wreathed in fog. The aircraft came within 100 feet of each other.\nIn late February, air traffic controllers at Boston averted a crash when a Learjet took off without clearance as a Jetblue flight was coming in to land on an intersecting runway. The JetBlue aircraft “took evasive action and initiated a climb-out,” according to an FAA statement.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, which looks into incidents, is now investigating all six events. It is also investigating a December incident, in which a United Airlines Boeing 777 jet departing from Hawaii plunged towards the ocean after takeoff, coming within 775 feet of sea level.\nThe FAA, which is also investigating the recent spate of incidents, says it has not found a common cause.\nIt seems like stories like this are becoming increasingly common. Or are they?\nWhat's going on with all the runway close calls\nMost incursions are not serious\nData from the FAA published in 2017 showed that reports of runway incursions have been on a largely upward trend since 1997, and steadily rising since 2011. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), formed in 1997, encouraged a culture of data sharing and no-blame safety reporting.\nThe number of accidents has remained relatively constant, according to FAA analysis through 2016, and it shows the cumulative risk trending down.\nThe FAA says most incursions are not classed as serious – few of the 120 or so logged in January 2023 have made headlines. That figure includes all incursions, including those involving general aviation aircraft.\nSome, however, can sound terrifying.\nThese include an event on January 18, in which a Boeing 737 took off from Dallas Love Field without ATC authorization; fortunately no other traffic was involved. And another at Florida’s Treasure Coast International, when a fire truck entered the runway as a business jet was taking off.\nTreasure Coast International Airport, seen in a file photo, was the site of serious runway incursion involving a fire truck in January.\nThe latter is deemed “category A” – the most serious of runway incursions, “in which a collision is narrowly avoided,” according to the FAA. And there’s been a recent uptick in those cases. Both 2022 and 2021 saw seven of them – up on three in 2019 and four in 2018, according to the FAA’s runway incursion database. However, there were 22 category A incidents in 2007, the sharpest peak in the past two decades.\nMost of the incursions involving commercial airliners that have made headlines this year are not yet entered into the FAA database. The agency did not provide specifics about how those incidents will be categorized.\n“The vast majority of runway incursions are not serious occurrences,” the FAA said in a statement. “However, reducing the risk of them occurring remains one of the FAA’s highest safety priorities and is a shared responsibility that encompasses pilots, air traffic controllers and airport vehicle drivers.”\nOn eve of safety summit, FAA investigates another runway close call\nWhile incident numbers might not be on a dramatically upward trajectory, they are causing alarm. In February, acting FAA administrator Billy Nolen sent a memo to the agency instructing staff to “stare into the data and ask hard questions.”\nBilly Nolen, acting FAA administrator, testifies during a congressional hearing in February.\nNolen renewed that call at the summit on Wednesday.\nAmong the questions he posed for consideration by the assembled experts: “In light of these recent close calls and the attention being focused on even the most routine of go-arounds, are we emphasizing efficiency over safety? How much of what we see can be attributed to the sudden resurgence in demand following the pandemic?”\nHe said that over the past 25 years the industry has made “enormous strides” in its ability to scour data and identify risks before they manifest into serious incidents or accidents, but he called on members of the aviation industry to discuss “concrete steps” to make the system safer.\n“America’s aviation safety net is strong, our goal, our obligation, is to sew those threads even tighter,” Nolen said.\nSystem under pressure\nIt’s about time, say some who work in the aviation industry amid fear that cuts made during the pandemic, plus a lack of scrutiny, have compromised America’s long safety culture in aviation.\nThe United States’ last fatal accident was in 2009, when Colgan Air flight 3407 crashed while flying from Newark to Buffalo, killing everyone onboard.\nThe NTSB investigation declared it to be pilot error, citing pilot fatigue as a factor.\nThe FAA revised duty times for pilots as a result, cutting them to a maximum of 14 hours, down from 16, including eight hours of flying. Minimum rest times rose from eight to 10 hours.\nCargo pilots can work slightly longer hours, despite sharing the runways with commercial pilots.\nAnd whereas previously airlines have stayed well within them, some are now asking pilots to work closer to the maximums.\nDennis Tajer, an American Airlines captain and spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents 15,000 AA pilots, says that, since the pandemic started, the pressure on pilots is at an all-time high. The union is in ongoing negotiations with the airline.\n“We’ve seen the system under pressure for well over a year, it was just a question of time before it was going to manifest itself in incidents,” he says.\n“Thankfully there’ve been no accidents – yet.”\nThe strong return of air travelers after the steep pandemic drop has put pressure on the US aviation system.\nPilot fatigue and shortages\nTajer cites a shortage of pilots caused by Covid lockdown layoffs as part of the problem. Last May, United CEO Scott Kirby said that there “simply aren’t enough pilots.”\nA February 2023 analysis by management consultancy Oliver Wyman estimated a “supply gap” of 18% of the US pilot workforce.\nAs a result, airlines have increased pilot hours – to within legal levels allowed by the FAA, but surpassing pre-pandemic schedules, says Tajer.\n“We are exhausted. Fatigue doesn’t happen in a moment – it can be chronic and that can affect your next flight. It’s like running an engine at its maximum all the time. At first it looks good, but over time things start to crack and leak. That’s what we’re seeing now.”\nAt the same time, he says, airlines are cutting back on training. In 2020, AA switched from retraining pilots every nine months, as it had done previously, to every 12 months – the FAA minimum standard.\nAA said any changes were in line with FAA rules and followed a thorough risk assessment. “Safety is the foundation of every decision we make at American, and is the north star of our Flight Training program,” it said in a statement to CNN.\n“We have the best, most expertly trained pilots in the business who are unwavering in their mission of operating a safe airline for our customers and fellow team members.”\nA worker on the tarmac at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas, in February.\nStaffing – of positions including pilots, air traffic controllers and ground crew – was frequently cited as a pressure point among industry leaders at the summit. As was the importance of adequate training for both those who are new and those who are returning after absences brought on by the pandemic. The loss of experienced workers was also a key concern.\n“With about half of our nation’s qualified pilots facing their mandatory retirement within 15 years, we are going to be training and hiring tens of thousands of new pilots over the next two decades,” said Faye Malarkey Black, president and CEO of the Regional Airline Association.\n“And it is extremely, extremely important when we’re doing this that we focus on building the right foundation from the start.”\nNicholas Calio, president and CEO of trade group Airlines for America, said US carriers have hired 100,000 new workers with a strong emphasis on training.\nRecent incursions have spurred intense focus on runway safety. The runway at San Francisco International Airport is seen in this 2019 file photo.\n‘A job that requires colossal concentration’\nTerry Tozer, a British former airline pilot and author who now comments on safety, sees systematic issues with US aviation protocols.\n“America is a very aviation-orientated country,” he says. “[Airports] pack a lot of traffic in… and if you put everyone under pressure, a cock-up [mistake] is more likely.”\nIn particular, “the American air traffic control system is very pressurized,” he says, pointing out that in the UK and the European Union, air traffic control workers get longer downtime.\n“Covid seems to have exacerbated the situation – there’s an issue with staffing levels, and that usually adds pressure on the people at the coalface. It’s a job that requires colossal concentration.”\nFAA regulations state that air traffic controllers can work no more than 10 hours a day (including two hours overtime), and get regular breaks.\nA Southwest Airlines aircraft taxis as an American Airlines aircraft lands at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, in a January 2022 file photo.\nLast summer, Airlines for America claimed the East Coast network was “crippled” due to lack of ATC staff.\n“Unfortunately, we have a staffing issue right now as air traffic controllers. We are 1,200 certified professional controllers less now than we were 10 years ago,” Rich Santa, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at the summit.\nNolen said the FAA is on pace to hire 1,500 controllers this year and 1,800 next year.\nTozer says that when he flew to the US, he’d feel “very uncomfortable” because of the way ATC in America clears aircraft to land when there will often still be a plane on the runway, about to take off. “In the UK and most of Europe, you won’t get a landing clearance from ATC until the runway ahead is clear. [In the US] they work on the assumption [pilots] will do as they’re told once they’re cleared to take off.”\nA spokesperson for the FAA told CNN that it continually evaluates procedures and that “line-up-and-wait procedures” were safeguarded either by technology or strict rules on visibility.\nThey said “extensive safety data” enables spot risks to be identified and issues resolved before accidents occur\nAs both pilots point out, the good news is that all we’ve seen so far are incidents, not accidents.\n“So you could argue that the system works,” says Tozer. “But the safety margins have been eroded a little.”\nCNN’s Marnie Hunter, Ross Levitt, Pete Muntean and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses a series of aviation incidents and near misses, including runway incursions and a United Airlines Boeing 777 incident that occurred just after takeoff.

The errors, which were recorded over the past 12 months, included staff giving patients empty cylinders or failing to switch over cylinders.\nIn some instances blunders “compromised” the delivery of oxygen to patients, which led to “serious deterioration and cardiac or respiratory arrest”, according to NHS England.\nThe alert states that extreme pressure on the health system, particularly when there are surges in respiratory illnesses such as flu and Covid-19, can lead to an increased use of oxygen cylinders where there is no access to medical gas pipeline systems. This might mean people who need oxygen being treated in a corridor or a side room not connected to the main supply system.\nThe surge in demand “increases the known risks associated with the use of oxygen gas cylinders”, the alert adds.\nOther errors were recorded relating to “inappropriate” transportation of cylinders or devices not secured properly.\nThe document, issued to A&E departments and ambulance trusts, also states that “there is a need to conserve oxygen cylinder use to ensure a robust supply chain process”.\nTrusts have been asked to ensure that risk assessments are done “in all areas where patients are being acutely cared for (either temporarily or permanently) without routine access to medical gas pipeline systems”.\nThe document says: “In the last 12 months (the NHS in England) identified 120 patient safety incidents, including those with these themes: cylinder empty at point of use; cylinder not switched on; cylinders inappropriately transported; cylinders inappropriately secured. Some of these reports described compromised oxygen delivery to the patient, leading to serious deterioration and cardiac or respiratory arrest.\n“During periods of extreme pressure, often exacerbated by a surge in respiratory conditions, demand on supplies of oxygen cylinders, especially the smaller sizes, increases in the NHS due to the need to provide essential oxygen treatment in areas without access to medical gas pipeline systems.\n“This surge in demand increases the known risks associated with the use of oxygen gas cylinders.

The KNKT said the airline had enacted such training since the accident.\nThe Sriwijaya Air crash underscored Indonesia's dismal air safety record, with three major commercial flight crashes in recent years.\nIn 2014, an AirAsia A320 jet crashed during bad weather into the Java Sea, killing 162 people.\nFour years later, in 2018, a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max plane crashed into the sea, killing 189 people.\nThat flight and the crash of another in Ethiopia months later prompted the grounding worldwide of the Boeing 737 Max, which had a faulty anti-stall system.\nMedia caption,\nDebris from Indonesia plane crash laid out in Jakarta port\nRelated Topics\nAviation accidents and incidents\nAviation safety\nIndonesia\nMore on this story\n'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among air crash missing\nPublished\n11 January 2021\nDebris from Indonesia plane crash laid out in Jakarta port.

The crash caused the engine and the first four or five coaches to jump the tracks, topple and hit the last two coaches of the Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express heading in the opposite direction, causing several carriages of that train to also derail.\nVaishnaw would not confirm if the human error or interference had played a role in the signalling malfunction. “Who has done it and what is the reason will come out of an investigation,” he added. The railways ministry has also sought a criminal investigation into the incident by the Central Bureau of Investigation, a government agency.\nTwo officials of the Railway Board also confirmed that the train had been given a green signal to proceed down the loop track and had not been over the speed limit at the time of the collision.\nJaya Varma Sinha, a member of the Railway Board, said failure of the track management system was the main focus of investigations. The computer-controlled “interlocking system”, which is in use across the whole railway network, coordinates and controls the signals to oncoming trains.\nIt is supposed to automatically direct a train to an empty track at the point where two tracks meet, but it appears this did not happen on Friday. Sinha said she had spoken to the driver, who survived the crash, and confirmed he had not jumped a signal.\n“It is supposed to be tamper-proof, error-proof. It is called a failsafe system, even if it fails the signal will turn red and the train will be stopped,” said Sinha. “However, as it is being suspected, there was some kind of a problem in the system.”\nMore than 1,000 rescuers have been working since Friday to locate survivors in the aftermath of the collision. On Sunday, as the operation was completed and all the remaining bodies were pulled from the wreckage, the process began of clearing the mangled carriages and relaying the tracks so service could resume along one of India’s busiest rail routes.\n“All bodies have been removed. Our target is to finish the restoration work by Wednesday morning so that trains can start running on this track,” said Vaishnaw as he visited the collision site on Sunday.\nThe death toll, earlier estimated at 288, was revised down on Sunday after it was found that some bodies had been counted twice, according to a statement by a senior Odisha state official.\nFive more bodies were brought to a school being used as a mortuary near the scene of the accident early on Sunday, where health workers struggled to deal with the scale of the decomposing bodies in the hot temperatures. Almost 100 ambulances were deployed to bring the bodies, many of which were mutilated beyond recognition, to hospitals and cold storage facilities in Odisha’s capital, Bhubaneswar, until they were claimed by relatives.\nFriday’s incident was the worst since 1995, when two trains collided near Delhi, killing 358 people. The accident has thrown a spotlight on the safety of the Indian railways at a time when the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has spent billions on a sleek modernisation of the British colonial-era railway network, which carries about 13 million passengers daily.\nDespite government efforts to improve rail safety, which have brought down fatalities to zero in the past two years, several hundred accidents occur every year on India’s railways, the largest train network under one management in the world, the majority of them due to derailment.\nA 2022 railways report into derailments had flagged multiple shortcomings into the laying of new tracks and serious lapses in rail safety, while a much-touted anti-collision programme has only been installed across 2% of India’s railway network.\nThe opposition Congress party called for Vaishnaw to resign over the incident, accusing the government of “serious deficiencies, criminal negligence and complete disregard for safety and security”.\nOn Saturday, Modi had pledged that “whoever is found responsible will be given the strongest punishment. They will not be spared.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it discusses a train disaster in India caused by an error in electronic signals that sent a train onto the wrong tracks.

The home secretary, Priti Patel, has also called for the BWV footage to be released.\nOne of the most controversial incidents involved the stop and search of athlete Bianca Williams during which she and her partner were handcuffed while their baby was in their car. It is now under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, despite the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, saying officers were right to carry out the stop.\nIn a memo sent within the Met on 28 August, Horne explained why footage would not be routinely released, writing: “Whilst we have seen some exemplary BWV of interactions with the public, with high levels of skill, patience and professionalism, we have seen many more examples where although the BWV does not show any conduct issues it shows poor communication, a lack of patience, a lack of de-escalation before use of force is introduced and occasionally poor officer safety decisions.\n“We want to be a learning organisation so when poor practice is identified or mistakes made we support people to develop and improve.”\nHorne urged officers to communicate more saying it could avoid the need for force to be used. In a section headlined “Comms or cuffs?”, Horne wrote: “Sometimes it appears that had we spoken to people for a little longer or taken the time to explain what we were doing, the situation may not have required force to be used.”\nThe document shows that the Met was concerned that releasing body-worn video could make things worse: “Release of BWV is highly likely to exacerbate not prevent ‘trial by social media’ and increase media interest in an incident.”\nIt says: “On its own BWV does not normally address the issue that the viral footage is causing public concern about – such as allegations of racial profiling.”\nThe document shows there could be exceptions when footage is released, and Horne wrote: “For example: where an incident is causing so much community concern that there is a realistic likelihood of serious disorder or serious injury and it becomes a matter of trust and confidence in policing.\n“In such situations releasing footage would counter inaccuracies that may be driving the public reaction, therefore reducing the likelihood of harm through disorder. Another exception may be where BWV is a necessary requirement in a crime appeal … ”\nHorne also wrote: “Where BWV shows use of force, although how the force used may be to a text book standard, issuing the footage is unlikely to be reassuring to our communities if the BWV made available, as when seen without the expert understanding of why force and that type of force is used it can exacerbate public concern regarding our tactics.”\nData protection rules are also cited in the documents as a reason for not publishing the footage gathered by police officers.\nKatrina Ffrench, of StopWatch, said: “I suspect that if this footage was shown it would illustrate the behaviours that black communities have been speaking about for generations, which is lack of professionalism, rudeness, excessive use of force.\nMohammed Qasim, a visiting research fellow in criminology at the London School of Economics, said: “There is a very real danger that by continuing to block the publication of video footage the Met will exacerbate mistrust amongst black and Asian communities.”\nOther exemptions to the Met’s policy of not releasing body-worn video footage include instances where the video conveys “a sense of the overall challenge officers faced” such as footage of a protest or an illegal rave.\nThe Met said in a statement: “Since 20 June, officers have reviewed 145 police interactions that have featured on social media. Of these, in eight cases were possible conduct matters identified, or was an IOPC referral thought suitable. In the majority of these clips, our officers were found to have been carrying out their job in a professional manner.\n“Officers can learn from each and every interaction they have with the public, and they are encouraged to reflect on every incident they handled and identify things that went well or could have been done differently.\n“The MPS also provides ongoing training to officers during their careers, including de-escalation skills and alternatives to using force.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The news discusses issues related to errors made by officers in the Metropolitan Police, including poor communication, a lack of patience, and a lack of de-escalation before the use of force.\",\n\"The leaked internal memo from a senior Metropolitan police chief highlights these errors and acknowledges that force used by officers on members of the public could have been avoided in some instances.\",\n\"The memo explains why the Metropolitan Police has decided not to routinely release its body-worn video (BWV) footage of controversial incidents, citing concerns about poor communication and the potential exacerbation of public concern.\",\n\"There is a mention of concerns about racial profiling and heavy-handedness in stop and search incidents, which is relevant to the broader context of navigation system error incidents as it involves potential misconduct by law enforcement officers.\",\n\"The news discusses the impact of releasing BWV footage on public trust and confidence in policing, which is relevant to the overall discussion of navigation system errors and their consequences.\",\n\"Data protection rules are cited as a reason for not publishing the footage, which is relevant to the privacy and legal aspects of navigation system error incidents.\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk-news\/2020\/oct\/19\/leaked-review-of-met-police-body-worn-videos-reveals-officer-errors","query_name":"updated_file_Navigation_system_error_incidents.xlsx"}

Although some fingers were pointed at a lack of investment in conventional railways in France – by no less than the head of SNCF, the French railway company – the route in Spain was completed only within the last two years.\nAlthough the causes of the crash are still unknown, early indications suggest that it is down to human error. The Spanish train is believed to have been travelling at 190km\/h on a stretch of curved track where 80km\/h was the safe limit. Although Renfe, the Spanish train operator, has yet to confirm the speed, the line of inquiry for investigators appears clear, says Sim Harris, managing editor of Railnews. \"Why was the driver going at that speed? Was there a train control system in operation? If so, why wasn't it working – and if not, why not?\"\nThe class 730 train is designed to run on electrified, high-speed lines or via a diesel engine on slower lines. At the curve before Santiago, the high-speed line joins the standard track – a point where two safety systems also switch. Wednesday's crash may have occurred in a transition zone between ETCS – the standardised European train control system that electronically relays information to the cab and drivers on high-speed services – and Spain's own automatic brake and signal warning system.\nDavid Briginshaw, editor-in-chief of the International Railway Journal, said that it was far too early to know the cause. \"All modern trains have automatic protection designed to prevent trains passing red signals or exceeding the speed limit. If the train was found to be exceeding the speed limit for that section of the route, it is very strange for it to be doing that – and for the driver not to be aware that the train was doing that.\"\nAccording to Professor Roger Kemp of the Royal Academy of Engineering, a derailment would be expected at 190km\/h on such a curve: \"The big question is why the train was running at more than twice the speed limit. There must have been at least prominent visual warnings to reduce speed, if not audible warnings and an electronic speed supervision system.\"\nPhilippa Oldham, head of transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said that while investigators would look at signalling, speed advice systems and the driver's role, factors such as \"rail breakages, train defects or damage caused by vandalism … could have contributed to the accident\".\nPrevious incidents have often involved a combination of factors, said Jim Steer of Greengauge 21, \"almost always involving human error at some level\". He dismissed suggestions that lack of investment could be affecting rail safety in Europe. Instead, he cautioned: \"You may have spent the money but if you've made an error laying the track or installing the safety systems then something like this can occur. It's tragic but railway accidents happen because someone makes a mistake.\"\nHuman error can't be eradicated even with the best warning systems, according to Dr Guy Walker, a lecturer in transport and infrastructure at Heriot-Watt University. He points to three accidents in Britain on a bend of similar proportions, the Morpeth curve – all down to speeding and driver error: \"Often disasters arise because people act in apparently rational ways. Increasingly technology can intervene but drivers can often override these warnings – and the Ladbroke Grove rail crash showed that the presence of frequent warnings led to drivers getting into the habit of cancelling or ignoring them. If anyone was put in that situation you could predict that behaviour.\"\nIn Spain as in the UK, train drivers receive \"road-learning\" for every track they travel. The driver would have been certified not just for his Renfe train, but for the exact route, which he had covered for a year.\nIf two major accidents in succession should have given any potential travellers concern, Oldham pointed out that rail causes far fewer deaths and injuries than car travel.\nBriginshaw added: \"Britain isn't doing anything that European countries aren't. Accidents in both France and Spain are very rare and Europe takes safety very seriously – standards are extremely high.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it discusses a recent train accident in Spain, where early indications suggest it was due to human error.

Satellite navigation systems are being blamed for wedging our once bucolic byways with trucks, HGVs and coaches.\nIn the latest incident, a lorry destroyed a series of walls before becoming stuck for three hours in Luddenden, West Yorkshire, when the sat-nav persuaded the driver to turn off the main road en route to Halifax. Sat-nav is also fingered for sending juggernauts sweating up St John's Hill, Shaftesbury, a Dorset lane so steep it tends to stop large vehicles, and for wedging a coach in a bend on Rosemary Lane in the Forest of Dean. (Freed by tractor, the coach - and its load of pensioners - pootled across three fields of stubble to rejoin the main road.)\nThere are 4m sat-navs in Britain. Numbers are predicted to double by 2008. With stress-free route-finding comes an increasing willingness to use country lanes.\nWith the sat-nav on, some drivers switch off their brains and miss crucial road signs. Others blame their sat-nav for being out of date when manufacturers usually offer updated mapping databases every three months.\nBut according to the AA, the problem is not simply driver error. Every sat-nav system is designed for cars. No database gives height, weight or width restrictions on roads. Nor does any system provide other essential information for truck drivers, such as time restrictions that bar late-night lorries on some residential streets.\nRuth Bridger of the AA Motoring Trust says manufacturers are looking at including information for lorries, but it could take some time. \"There is a bit of reluctance to make a lorry sat-nav system.

In terms of understanding the potential linkage between records, a one-person record can have multiple arrest records and one arrest record can have multiple offences linked to it.”\nThe DNA database is connected to the PNC and has also been hit, the police chief’s letter reveals. It says: “Approximately 26,000 DNA records corresponding to 21,710 subjects have potentially been deleted in error, including records that have previously been marked for indefinite retention following conviction of serious offences.”\nTechnicians are also scrambling to recover tens of thousands of fingerprint records, according to the deputy chief constable’s letter, which says that “30,000 fingerprint records and 600 subject records have potentially been deleted in error”.\nPolice fear offenders may be missed. Malik wrote in the letter to police chiefs: “As the National DNA Database and the National Fingerprint Collection currently contain incomplete sets of biometric records, there is the possibility that biometric matches between crime scenes and offenders may not be identified.”\nThe letter reveals cases where some people police suspect nearly got away because of the blunder: “We are aware of a couple of instances of ‘near misses’ for serious crimes where a biometric match to an offender was not generated as expected but the offender was identified through matches between scenes. However, in these circumstances, without a direct match report to the subject, it may be more challenging for police to progress to an interview or arrest.\n“We are also aware of at least one instance where the DNA profile from a suspect in custody did not generate a match to a crime scene as expected, potentially impeding the investigation of the individual’s involvement in the crime.”\nThe Home Office said it was working with police to assess the impact of the error, which reportedly occurred by accident during a weekly “weeding” session to expunge data.\nThe policing minister, Kit Malthouse, said the PNC was a large database of information that requires maintenance, adding: “Unfortunately down to human error, some defective code was introduced as part of that routine maintenance earlier this week and that’s resulted in a deletion of some records and that’s currently under investigation.\n\n“We are now working very quickly with policing partners and within the Home Office to try and recover the data and assess the full extent of the problem.”\n\nAlthough officials are “not entirely sure as yet” whether the problem has had an operational impact on the police, Malthouse said, contingency plans have been put in place to ensure investigations can continue.\nThe shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, called on Patel to make an urgent statement: “It’s not good enough for the home secretary to hide behind her junior minister on this when there has been such a major security breach on her watch.\n“It’s now vital that she makes an urgent statement outlining the true scale of the issue, when ministers were informed and what the plan is to provide public reassurance. Yet again, Conservative incompetence is putting people’s safety at risk.”\nHe added: “This is an extraordinarily serious security breach that presents huge dangers for public safety. The incompetence of this shambolic government cannot be allowed to put people at risk, let criminals go free and deny victims justice.”\nOn Friday night Thomas-Symonds wrote to Patel, urging her to show “personal responsibility and leadership” and asking when ministers were first made aware of the breach, if local forces had been informed of potential impacts in their area, and what steps were being taken to retrieve the data.\nThe PNC allows real-time checks on people and vehicles. Millions of records are kept on it, and they are removed automatically after certain periods depending on the nature of the offence, the suspect’s history and other factors.\nWhat the loss of records from the Police National Computer means\nRead more\nThe deletion also caused chaos with the visa process.

The agencies are also investigating the battery fire that followed the crash.\nTesla later said the car had activated Autopilot, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks. The company said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by Huang before the crash and that he had received warnings to put his hands on the wheel.\nThe NTSB confirmed on Wednesday that it has two other pending investigations of other Tesla crashes, including a probe of an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, that occurred after an owner lost control and ran into his garage. That fire probe had not previously been reported.\n“We’re really more looking at the fire aspects,” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt told Reuters, saying that the battery continued to ignite even after it was loaded onto a truck.\nTesla declined to comment on the August incident.\nThe NTSB previously said it also is probing an incident in which a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode struck a fire truck in California in January.\nThe law firm said its preliminary review suggested the autopilot feature was defective and had uncovered complaints by other Tesla drivers of navigational errors by the system.\n“(Our) preliminary review indicates that the navigation system of the Tesla may have misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, failed to brake the car, and drove the car into the median,” Minami said.\nWhile sympathizing with the family, Tesla again blamed Huang, saying he was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he had told them it was not reliable in that exact location, but nonetheless engaged Autopilot.\nTesla said the system always reminds drivers to be alert and have hands on the wheel and had warned Huang several times on the day of the crash to do so.\n“The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,” a Tesla spokesperson told Reuters.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Patrick Graham and Dan Grebler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Based on the provided news article, I have analyzed it to determine if it is about Navigation system error incidents.

attacks from Russia and other countries pose persistent threats to the 2020 elections, election security analysts and key Democrats warn.\nTrump threatens Iran will pay ‘a very big price’ over US embassy protests in Baghdad\nRead more\nIn November significant electronic voting equipment problems occurred in an election in the vital battleground state of Pennsylvania, sparking a lawsuit by advocacy groups charging the state is using insecure electronic voting machines.\nOther key states like Florida and North Carolina which experienced voting problems in 2016 and Georgia which had serious equipment problems in 2018, are being urged to take precautions to curb new difficulties in 2020, say election analysts.\nThe Brennan Center’s electoral reform program last month released a study that stressed testing backup systems and electronic voting equipment before the primaries and next November’s general election was needed to reduce risks of cyber attacks and equipment failures, and offered guidance about ways to recover from attacks or malfunctions.\nIn response to these and other threats, Congress in December added $425m for election-related spending, including security measures, to a massive $1.4tn spending bill for 2020.\nBut Democratic senators such as Mark Warner and Ron Wyden, who backed other election security bills that passed the House but were blocked by Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, still see the need for more election security measures next year, including permanent security funding and other steps to ensure safe elections.\nIn advocating for more funding and legislation, Warner and other election security specialists cite intelligence warnings that the Kremlin will try to disrupt the election in 2020, as it did in 2016 when cyber attacks and social media campaigns sowed dissension and helped Donald Trump become president.\n“The intelligence community has warned us that Russia will try again in 2020, and we have to be prepared,” Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, told the Guardian.\n“After months of pressure, Republican leaders in Congress have finally acknowledged that states need more resources to combat this threat – but additional money is no substitute for a permanent funding mechanism for securing and maintaining elections systems, and comprehensive legislation to protect our elections – both of which the White House and GOP leadership have been blocking for two years now,” Warner added.\nRussia, China, Iran, and other foreign malicious actors all will seek to interfere in the voting process\nWarner’s concerns were underscored in November when seven top agency officials, including the heads of the FBI and CIA, issued a joint statement predicting Russia, and other countries intend to meddle in the 2020 elections via cyber attacks or social media.\n“Russia, China, Iran, and other foreign malicious actors all will seek to interfere in the voting process or influence voter perceptions,” the joint statement said.\nThe threat of more cyber attacks, plus disinformation and social media operations to sway public opinion, has prompted the federal government to work closely with officials in all 50 states, the statement said.\nA Senate intelligence committee report in mid-2019 concluded that Kremlin hackers manipulated election systems in all 50 states, and succeeded in breaching systems in two Florida counties and another state, although vote totals were apparently not affected.\nLooking ahead at other potential election security problems, Wyden voiced concern that the $425m allocated for 2020 election administration could be used for other purposes than security measures since it was written without tight spending guidelines.\n“While I appreciate the intent, the funding in this spending bill will most likely lead to a massive giveaway to companies that make insecure voting machines,” Wyden told the Guardian. “Not only does this bill let states use federal money to buy insecure machines, it actually says money can go to office chairs, printers or anything related to running an election.”\nWyden added: “Congress must pass legislation to secure our entire election system, from voter registration systems and e-poll books, to voting machines and election night reporting websites.”\nBy way of example, Wyden and election security analysts note that e-poll books, which are used in numerous states such as North Carolina and Georgia to track registered voters and speed up voting, still lack national standards and could be vulnerable to attacks or failures.\nLikewise, the recent Brennan report cited growing usage of e-poll books as one of several potential trouble spots for the 2020 elections, and suggested that more advance planning is warranted to ensure safe elections in November. The study estimates 41 states will be using e-poll books next November.\nUber and Postmates sue to block California’s new gig worker law\nRead more\n“I think the period between now and next November is crucial for preparing for potential problems,” said Larry Norden, the director of Brennan’s electoral reform program.\nNorden cautions e-poll books pose a “new threat, (since) they’ve become so much more widespread in the last few years.”\nSimilarly, new questions are being raised about the safety of some electronic voting equipment given problems in 2019 and 2018, respectively, in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\nA lawsuit was filed last month to block Pennsylvania from certifying electronic voting equipment that Philadelphia has purchased, after the same machines encountered significant problems in November in undercounting votes in nearby Northampton County.\nThe equipment was made by Nebraska based ES&S, which boasts about 50% of the national voting machine market and has been cited before for malfunctions. In Georgia in the 2018 elections, for instance, old voting machines made by ES&S were involved in counting votes in a race where reportedly about 80,000 votes were strangely not cast, sparking ongoing litigation.\nMore recently in Georgia tests of new e-poll books in six county elections in November revealed software glitches in a few of the counties, delaying voting and spurring the use of paper records instead to check in voters.\nIn light of the multiple concerns, Norden stressed the primaries next year “should be watched carefully so we can learn from any problems during them. They should be used as an opportunity to be better prepared in November.”\nNorden added that “This is probably going to be the highest turnout election in most people’s lives which adds to the complexity,” of protecting election security.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses potential electronic voting equipment failures and cyber attacks on the 2020 elections, which are relevant to navigation system error incidents in the context of election security and potential disruptions to the voting process.

Shipments of the pathogen continued through April 2015, Reuters reported.\nOfficials have said the mistake did not pose a risk to the public, though four civilians have been placed on a preventative course of medication, which usually includes antibiotics. Twenty-two workers in South Korea are being treated preventatively.\nMilitary officials said army technicians believed they had inactivated the bacteria at the time it was sent, and that all protocols appeared to have been followed.\n“The best I can tell there was not human error,” chief of staff Raymond Odierno told reporters on Thursday, Reuters reported, while cautioning that the information was based solely on preliminary reports. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating the failure.\nBut beyond a broad sketch of the events that led the dangerous pathogen to be shipped to commercial labs, officials at the Department of Defense have released little information. Rather than respond to a list of questions from the Guardian, the department provided a statement recapping reported facts in the story.\nIt is unclear, for example, what protocols were in place to inactivate the bacteria, and to confirm that status before the anthrax was shipped and received.\n“The incident involved exactly the same chain of errors as the CDC shipments of live anthrax bacteria in 2006 and 2014,” Richard H Ebright, professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told the Guardian in an email.\nEbright said technicians failed to “inactivate a sample, followed by a failure to confirm inactivation before shipping the sample, followed by … a failure to confirm inactivation upon receiving the sample”.\n“This seems to be a problem that happens pretty regularly,” said Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior associate at the Center for Health Security at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland.\n“Even if people are not following the protocol … then perhaps the protocol should be modified to make sure it’s easier to follow, and more likely to bring about compliance. It’s more, to me, that not enough is known about the situation.”\nGronvall noted that the military had made a point of reporting the incident. “In many other, different places in the world there would be no notice that something happened incorrectly,” she said.\nIn some cases, clearing laboratories appears to have been left to state officials, as in New Jersey. There, state health, environmental and police hazardous materials responders were sent to the private lab.\nEleven months ago, a similar incident played out at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.\nThere, a lack of “standard operating procedures” led to dozens of employees being exposed to anthrax after a high-containment laboratory inadvertently sent live anthrax to labs with lower contaminant levels, where workers were not equipped to handle such dangerous pathogens.\nThe mistake happened after workers did not fully inactivate a pathogenic strain of the bacteria. Normally labs irradiate anthrax, but scientists at the CDC were working on new methods to inactivate the material for local health departments that might not have expensive irradiation machines.\nBoth Ebright and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have been critical of the government’s expansion of high-containment laboratories without an overarching regulatory body.\n“There are approximately 1,500 US laboratories authorized to work with fully active, fully virulent, biological weapons agents,” said Ebright, who has worked to sound the alarm on lab safety since funding increased in 2002. “This number is too large by a factor of 10 to 20.”\nBecause labs have at least some risk of making mistakes with such agents, the GAO and Ebright said the more labs, the bigger the risk to the public.\nAt least three agencies, including the defense department, the CDC and the Department of Agriculture, oversee such labs, and regulators largely rely on “self-policing”, the GAO reported.\n“Oversight is critical in improving biosafety and ensuring that high-containment laboratories comply with regulations,” the report said. “However, our work has found that aspects of the current oversight programs … depend on entities’ monitoring themselves and reporting incidents to the regulators.”\nStopping the spread of such bacteria is just one problem with such a diffuse system. The GAO also found that labs could duplicate efforts and waste taxpayer money without coordinated government oversight.\nMore labs began working with dangerous agents like anthrax in the 1990s, but the number grew substantially after a number of anthrax-laced letters were sent to lawmakers and media outlets through the US Postal Service in 2001. Since then, the CDC has led the investment of at least $9bn in state and local health agencies.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it discusses a series of errors and failures in handling dangerous pathogens, similar to navigation system errors.

Eight per cent of incidents, 15 out of 195 errors, involved drugs given in doses 10 times too high or too low.\nNo patient died as a result but two cases, involving the wrong concentration of an anti-cancer treatment and the intravenous infusion of a sedative that was 100 times too high, were said to have had the potential to cause serious harm. Three others could have had moderately serious consequences.\nNearly 10% of the patients needed extra treatment or investigation, including, in four cases, an extra drug to mitigate the effects of the errors.\nThe authors of the study, published in Archives of Diseases in Childhood, said those responsible for recording errors sometimes thought it was not worth telling parents about labelling errors noticed before drugs were given. In other cases, it was considered unnecessary to cause \"undue stress\" when the child had come to no harm.\nThe researchers, from the department of child health at Glasgow University and the hospital's pharmacy department, say many hospitals have no system for reporting errors, unlike the Royal where there has been a mandatory scheme for years. This is to change soon when the NHS introduces compulsory national arrangements.\nMore than half the mistakes involved intravenous treatments, including antibiotics, anti-viral medication, anti-cancer drugs and feeding fluids and a third involved oral medication. Most errors happened on the medical wards and were reported by nurses.\nThe authors say it is important for staff to check calculations and avoid decimal points. Most errors were not down to negligence but organisational failures.\nIn a commentary on the study, Terence Stephenson, of the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, suggests that, extrapolating the figures, there would be at least 1,675 avoidable medication errors a year involving children under 16 in English hospitals. Of those, 85 might involve moderate or severe reactions. The true figures were probably higher and although there had been no deaths in the Scottish study, fatalities did occur because of medication errors.\nImprovements could include standardisation of infusion pumps regulating intravenous treatments and more thorough checking of prescriptions and calculations.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it discusses errors in hospital treatment, including the administration of the wrong medicine, incorrect dosages, and errors in drug routes.

Backers of eLoran say the lack of stations in Norway will create gaps in signal coverage.\nJon Georg Dale, State Secretary with Norway’s Ministry of Transport and Communications, said its Space Centre concluded in a report that “a long duration loss of satellite signals is not very likely to happen, and sporadic losses of satellite signals would have relatively small consequences for maritime users”.\nDale said the view was shared by Norway’s coastal administration.\n“The GPS system has so far proved reliable, and the introduction of the Russian GLONASS, the European Galileo and the Chinese Beidou satellite navigation systems will further reduce the GNSS vulnerability,” Dale told Reuters.\nROTTERDAM WON OVER\nUnderscoring the growing risks, the GLA recorded two incidents in April when the GLONASS system experienced signal disruptions. In one of them, GLONASS transmitted location errors up to 55 km off the UK coastline for almost 12 hours.\nThe GLA has already deployed eLoran in the Dover Strait in the English Channel - one of Europe’s busiest waterways. A further six installations along Britain’s east coast will have eLoran equipment by September including the ports of Middlesbrough in England and Grangemouth and Aberdeen in Scotland.\neLoran works on earth-based radio systems to provide alternative position and timing signals for navigation. Ships need to install receiver equipment.\nThe Port of Rotterdam has become the latest top terminal to deploy a complementary eLoran system called eDLoran.\nWim van Buuren of the Dutch Pilots Association said ship pilots from Rotterdam initiated the deployment of eDLoran.\nOther Dutch pilots operating in terminals such as Amsterdam have shown interest too, he said.\n“Sailing the approaches towards many ports along the shallow sandy Dutch coast requires precise navigation with a backup navigation system included,” van Buuren said.\n“Oil spills, running aground with a ship because of a lack of proper position fixing means are scenarios which are not tolerated anymore nowadays by the public.

{"num":100,"Time":"Updated 7:23 AM EDT, Thu November 2, 2017","Title":"US Navy: 2 deadly summer collisions were ‘avoidable’","Content":"STORY HIGHLIGHTS\nFollowing the collisions a total of eight senior Navy leaders were relieved of duty\nThe report details the heroism of several crew members risking their lives to help others to safety\nWashington\nCNN\n — \nThe US Navy has released a report concluding that two fatal collisions that resulted in the deaths of 17 sailors during the summer were “avoidable.”\nThe guided-missile destroyers USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain collided with commercial ships in June and August, respectively.\nIn both collisions, the Navy found numerous failures by the crews and commanders of the ships. Those failures included not following standard navigation and seamanship practices, and poor situational awareness of what the ships were facing as they navigated congested seas off Japan and Singapore.\n“They were either incredibly complacent or sloppy beyond description,” said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy officer who spent 10 years “driving the ships.”\nThe Navy report said the failures that led to the collision were spread among the officers and crew of both ships.\nSchuster said long and oftentimes solo deployments by US Navy ships in familiar waters may be part of the problem.\n“Ships no longer operate in close proximity to each other. You lose that instinct and concern to ships passing close to you,” he said.\nIn the cases of the Fitzgerald and McCain, “the guys were relaxed and complacent and it burned them,” said Schuster, now a Hawaii Pacific University professor.\nThe crews may have also been fatigued, he said. A US Government Accountability Office report from September warned lengthy deployments of US ships based in Japan, as both the Fitzgerald and McCain were, was a problem as training was being curtailed.\n“A ship that spends too much time at sea tends to get an exhausted crew,” Schuster said.\nAnd without training time, “perishable skills atrophy,” said Schuster. “Ships’ crews get a tendency to be good only at steaming from point A to point B. The things that are most dangerous to you are things you’re only going to do one percent of the time,” he added.\nUSS Fitzgerald collision\nSeven sailors died aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald when it collided with a cargo ship off the east coast of Japan on June 17.\nIn Wednesday’s report, the Navy found “numerous failures occurred on the part of leadership” and those assigned to stand watch on the ship. There were failures to: plan for safety; adhere to sound navigation practice; execute basic watch-standing practices; properly use available navigation tools; and respond deliberately and effectively to an emergency.\nUS Navy officers lose jobs after fatal collision\n“Many of the decisions made that led to this incident were the result of poor judgment and decision-making of the commanding officer. That said, no single person bears full responsibility for this incident. The crew was unprepared for the situation in which they found themselves through a lack of preparation, ineffective command and control, and deficiencies in training and preparations for navigation,” the report said.\nThe report details the heroism of several crew members risking their lives to help others to safety as water flooded in after a massive hole was ripped into the ship by the collision. One sailor was nearly drowned in the water, losing consciousness when he made his way to safety.\nThe report detailed the extraordinary efforts to save the trapped commanding officer from his crushed cabin: “A junior officer and two chief petty officers removed debris from in front of the door and crawled into the cabin. The skin of the ship and outer bulkhead were gone and the night sky could be seen through the hanging wires and ripped steel. The rescue team tied themselves together with a belt in order to create a makeshift harness as they retrieved the CO, who was hanging from the side of the ship.”\nThose actions stand in sharp contrast to some of the initial failures by key crew members in the moments before the ship collided with the commercial ship MV Crystal. Investigators wrote they found, “Initially, the officer of the deck intended to take no action, mistaking Crystal to be another of the two vessels with a greater closest point of approach. Eventually, the officer of the deck realized that Fitzgerald was on a collision course with Crystal, but this recognition was too late.”\nThe Crystal also failed to take action, the Navy said, but the military still holds itself at fault for failing to avoid the collision.\nExclusive: US Navy ships in deadly collisions had dismal training records\n“The officer of the deck, the person responsible for safe navigation of the ship, exhibited poor seamanship by failing to maneuver as required, failing to sound the danger signal and failing to attempt to contact Crystal on bridge-to-bridge radio. In addition, the officer of the deck did not call the commanding officer as appropriate and prescribed by Navy procedures to allow him to exercise more senior oversight and judgment of the situation.” The report details similar failures by other crew members.\nUSS John S McCain collision\nThe events on the USS John S McCain, which claimed the lives of 10 sailors on August 21 near Singapore when it collided with a merchant vessel, were equally harrowing.\nKey causes of the collision outlined in the report included: a failure of situational awareness in response to mistakes in the ship’s operation; a failure to follow international maritime rules that apply to maneuvering of vessels in the face of a possible collision; and the fact some of the sailors were insufficiently proficient with the ship’s systems.\nThe ship, with approximately 300 sailors aboard, was 50 nautical miles east of Singapore in the predawn hours of August 21 when the commanding officer ordered the watch team on duty to divide the duties of steering and the speed control of the ship after noticing one of the sailors on deck was having some difficulty at the controls.\nMany warnings of readiness 'crisis' before latest ship accidents\nAccording to the report, this shift created confusion among the team, and after steering control of the ship was transferred to a different control station, members of the crew failed to recognize the change in configuration.\nWhile the McCain was now in a heavily congested maritime environment, it was soon on a course to collide with the Alnic MC, an approximately 30,000-ton and 600-foot-long oil and chemical tanker.\nThe report says the commanding officer and others on the ship’s bridge “lost situational awareness” and did not register the course and speed of the approaching tanker the McCain collided with after crossing in front of the tanker’s bow.\nThe impact created a 28-foot in diameter hole both above and below the waterline. All 10 of the fallen sailors aboard the McCain were in the same berthing compartment at the time of impact, the report said, and eight were likely sleeping in their beds at the time of the collision.\nBased on the size of the hole, the report concluded the space “likely fully flooded in less than a minute after the collision.”\nReport: Massive morale problems aboard US Navy ship\nIn another berthing compartment impacted by the collision, one sailor resting in his bed shouted for help as he became pinned between his sleeping rack and another as water began to rush all around him, and he was only extracted after fellow sailors were able to use a “jaws of life” cutting device to separate the racks and pull him to safety.\nThe collision was felt throughout the ship, according to the report, with sailors on the bridge jolted from their stations while others were thrown off their feet.\nThe communications systems on the bridge stopped working after the collision, with the bridge reduced to using handheld radios and phones, which do not require electricity to transmit. The loss of communications was due to the quick flooding of the berthing compartment that housed much of the ship’s communications control equipment.\nWhy are so many Navy ships crashing?\nThe McCain was able to request tugboats and pilots from Singapore Harbor to assist in getting the ship to Changi Naval Base.\nWhile the process of accounting for all crew members began immediately after the collision, the damage to the ship made confirming the location of some personnel exceedingly difficult. Varying reports of missing sailors were made in the minutes after the collision.\nMedical teams aboard the McCain established a triage center in the mess area, where crews would normally eat their meals, to tend to injuries that ranged from chemical burns to broken bones and open wounds.\nFive sailors who were eventually evacuated to hospitals in Singapore suffered severe injuries, including a sailor who was pinned to his sleeping rack after the collision.\n“Many of the decisions that led to this incident were the result of poor judgment and decision-making of the commanding officer,” the report said. “That said, no single person bears full responsibility for this incident.”\nAmong the lapses, the report said leadership aboard the ship failed to assign sufficiently experienced officers to certain duties and also faulted other senior officers for not attending a security briefing the afternoon before the collision designed to provide awareness of the risks involved in upcoming operations.\nAftermath\nFollowing the collisions, a total of eight senior leaders were relieved of duty: the commander of the 7th Fleet; the commander of Task Force 70\/Carrier Strike Group 5; the commander of Destroyer Squadron 15; the commanding officer of the USS Fitzgerald; the executive officer of the USS Fitzgerald; the command master chief of the USS Fitzgerald; the commanding officer of the USS John S. McCain; and the executive officer of the USS John S. McCain.\nAdditionally, various members of the both ships’ bridge and Combat Information Center watch teams also received administrative actions. The Navy does not make these public, but the actions could include letters of reprimand that could effectively end their careers. If continuing investigations uncover other information that requires additional punishments, further actions may still be taken, according to the Navy.\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, reacted to the report. “We are dangerously underinvesting in our military,” he said. “Training, readiness and maintenance are hit the earliest – and tragic errors like this are the canary-in-the-mine warning bells.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it discusses two fatal collisions involving US Navy ships, the USS Fitzgerald and USS John S.

{"num":99,"Time":"Tue 30 Jan 2018 23.15 CET","Title":"Hawaii official who sent false missile alert has been fired","Content":"The head of Hawaii’s emergency management agency has resigned and a state employee who sent out an false alarm of an imminent missile attack has been fired, it was announced on Tuesday, after an inquiry into a mistake which caused statewide panic earlier this month.\nAccording to a federal inquiry into the incident, the employee, a watch officer at the emergency management agency, believed the threat of a missile attack to be real as he had not heard a recorded message announcing it as an exercise. According to state officials, the watch officer had been a cause for concern to his colleagues for more than a decade and had twice before mistaken drills for real alerts. It was unclear how he had managed to remain in such a sensitive post for so long.\nAs well as that employee’s dismissal and the resignation of the agency’s chief, Vern Miyagi, another official quit and a fourth has been suspended as a result of the incident.\nAccording to an official report, it took nearly 40 minutes to put out the all-clear, because the agency had not rehearsed what to do in the event of a false alarm and found lines jammed by anxious callers. Efforts by Hawaii’s governor to correct the mistake were delayed because he did not know his Twitter login.\nThe report by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released on Tuesday said the error was the result of a misunderstanding among employees of Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency during a shift change.\nWhen he was handing over at 8am, the outgoing supervisor told the incoming day shift supervisor that he was going to conduct a ballistic missile preparedness drill.\n“But there was a miscommunication,” said James Wiley, an FCC legal counsel who presented the report. “The incoming day shift supervisor thought that the midnight shift supervisor intended to conduct a drill for the midnight shift warning officers only (those ending their shift) – not for the day shift officers (those beginning their shift).”\nAs a result, the day shift supervisor was not in the right place to make sure that his watch officers understood it was just a drill.\n00:02:22\n‘This is not a drill’: Hawaiians react to 'incoming missile' false alarm – video\nAccording to the FCC account, the night supervisor started the drill by calling the day shift warning officers, who had not been told there was to be an exercise, and pretending to be US Pacific Command.\nThe supervisor played a recorded message which began and ended with the words “exercise, exercise, exercise”. However, the main text of the message was not the same as that used for a routine drill, and instead followed a script used for an actual alert, including the sentence: “This is not a drill.”\nSomehow, one of the day shift warning officers heard “this is not a drill”, but not the words “exercise, exercise, exercise”, and “therefore believed that the missile threat was real.”\nThe officer who had misheard was sitting at that terminal used to send out alerts, and chose to send a live alert from a drop-down menu.\nA prompt appeared on the screen saying: “Are you sure that you want to send this alert?” and at 8.07 am, the officer clicked “yes”, sending out an all-capitals text message to mobile phones all over the state, saying: “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”\nThe the alert came at a time of high tensions over North Korea’s nuclear programme, heightening the ensuing panic, as people sought shelter or tried to find other family members, fearing they could be living their last moments.\n“It was definitely kind of a panic zone,” Ashly Trask, who lives on the island of Kauai, said at the time. “Everyone knows you have about 15 minutes until detonation, and no one knows where it will land.”\nThe initial official account of the mistake suggested that a watch officer had sent a live alert by mistake by clicking the wrong online button. In its report on Tuesday, the FCC indicated it could not “fully evaluate” this new version of events as it had not been able to interview the hapless warning officer who had actually sent out the alert. The report did not say why the officer could not be reached.\nThe FCC report also looked at why it took so long to cancel the alert. Officials in the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency knew immediately the alert was a mistake, but it took 38 minutes for the error to be rectified on the public alert system.\nFurther alerts were stopped after five minutes, but the cancellationdoes not automatically generate an “all clear” message, or recall the earlier false alerts. A further 13 minutes was spent trying to get through to radio and TV stations to inform them of the error.\nThen a Facebook and Twitter message was put up on the emergency management agency’s accounts. It was not until 8.24am that the corrective message was retweeted by the Hawaii governor, David Ige.\nThe FCC report notes drily: “The governor has stated that he was unable to do this earlier because he did not know his Twitter password.”\nIt was not until 8.27 – 20 minutes after the false alarm – that an agency meeting was held to discuss putting out a correction on the statewide emergency alert system, but it took from 8.31am to 8.45 to log on to the appropriate software, create the correction and then send it out, in part because there was no template for a false alert message.\nMissile defence drills have been suspended until a full inquiry is completed.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Navigation system error incidents because it describes a false missile alert incident in Hawaii caused by a misunderstanding and miscommunication among employees.

Perhaps this would be no bad thing: we'd be less likely to drive into rivers or over cliffs through misplaced trust in our navigation devices.\nPick your own favourite story about the kind of idiocy only GPS can enable. Mine is the Swedish couple who misspelled the Italian island of Capri and turned up hundreds of miles away in Carpi, asking where the sea was.\nBut these are the exceptions.\nDevices that use GPS usually stop us getting lost. If it failed, the roads would be clogged with drivers slowing to peer at signs or stopping to consult maps. If your commute involves a train, there'd be no information boards to tell you when to expect the next arrival.\nPhone for a taxi, and you'd find a harassed operator trying to keep track of her fleet by calling the drivers. Open the Uber app, and - well, you get the picture.\nWith no GPS, emergency services would start struggling: operators wouldn't be able to locate callers from their phone signal, or identify the nearest ambulance or police car.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nThere would be snarl-ups at ports: container cranes need GPS to unload ships.\nGaps could appear on supermarket shelves as \"just-in-time\" logistics systems judder to a halt. Factories could stand idle because their inputs didn't arrive just in time either.\nFarming, construction, fishing, surveying - these are other industries mentioned by a UK government report that pegs the cost of GPS going down at about $1bn (£820m) a day for the first five days.\nIf it lasted much longer, we might start worrying about the resilience of a whole load of other systems that might not have occurred to you if you think of GPS as a location service.\nIt is that, but it's also a time service.\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.\nGPS consists of 24 satellites that all carry clocks synchronised to an extreme degree of precision.\nWhen your smartphone uses GPS to locate you on a map, it's picking up signals from some of those satellites - and it's making calculations based on the time the signal was sent and where the satellite was.\nIf the clocks on those satellites stray by a thousandth of a second, you'll mislay yourself by 200km or 300km.\nSo if you want incredibly accurate information about the time, GPS is the place to get it.\nConsider phone networks: your calls share space with others through a technique called multiplexing - data gets time stamped, scrambled up, and unscrambled at the other end.\nA glitch of just 100,000th of a second can cause problems. Bank payments, stock markets, power grids, digital television, cloud computing - all depend on different locations agreeing on the time.\nIf GPS were to fail, how well, and how widely, and for how long would backup systems keep these various shows on the road? The not very reassuring answer is that nobody really seems to know.\nNo wonder GPS is sometimes called the \"invisible utility\".\nTrying to put a dollar value on it has become almost impossible. As the author Greg Milner puts it in Pinpoint: How GPS is Changing Our World, you may as well ask: \"How much is oxygen worth to the human respiratory system?\"\nGPS pioneers awarded Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering\nIt's a remarkable story for an invention that first won support in the US military because it could help with bombing people - and even it was far from sure it needed it.

The truth is they weren't but they couldn't do much about it.\nThey tried having the satellites send in effect two signals - an accurate one for their own use, and a degraded, fuzzier one for civilians - but companies found clever ways to tease more focus from the fuzzy signals. And the economic boost was becoming ever plainer.\nIn 2000, President Bill Clinton bowed to the inevitable and made the high-grade signal available to all.\nMore things that made the modern economy:\nWhat do drones and GPS owe to a 1744 shipwreck?\nHow the search for a ‘death ray’ led to radar\nThe CubeSat revolution changing the way we see the world\nHow the smartphone became so smart\nThe American taxpayer puts up the billion-odd dollars a year it takes to keep GPS going, and that's very kind of them.

A big enough solar storm could also do the job.\nThere are land-based alternatives to satellite navigation. The main one is called eLoran but it doesn't cover the whole world, and some countries are putting more effort than others into their national systems.\nOne big appeal of eLoran is its signals are stronger. By the time GPS signals have made their 20,000km (12,000-mile) journey to Earth, they're extremely weak - which makes them easy to jam, or to spoof, if you know what you're doing.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nRussia has denied Israeli suggestions that it is behind ongoing disruption of GPS signals at Israel's Ben Gurion airport\nPeople paid to think about these things worry less about the apocalyptic scenarios - waking up one day to find the whole thing offline - and more about the potential for terrorists or nation states to wreak havoc by feeding inaccurate signals to GPS receivers in a certain area.\nEngineering professor Todd Humphreys has shown spoofing can down drones and divert super-yachts. He worries attackers could feasibly fry electricity grids, cripple mobile networks or crash stock markets.\nThe truth is it's hard to be sure how much damage spoofing GPS signals might do.\nBut just ask those Swedish tourists in Carpi.

You can say we wait until we find the solution but that means if more clocks fail we will reduce the capability of Galileo. But if we launch we will at least maintain if not increase the [capability], but we may then take the risk that a systematic problem is not considered. We are right now in this discussion about what to do.\"\nStill operational\nEach Galileo satellite carries two rubidium and two hydrogen maser clocks. The multiple installation enables a satellite to keep working after an initial failure.\nAll 18 spacecraft currently in space continue to operate, but one of them is now down to just two clocks.\nMost of the maser failures (5) have occurred on the satellites that were originally sent into orbit to validate the system, whereas all three rubidium stoppages are on the spacecraft that were subsequently launched to fill out the network.\nEsa staff at its technical centre, ESTEC, in the Netherlands are trying to isolate the cause the of failures - with the assistance of the clock (Spectratime of Switzerland) and satellite manufacturers (Airbus and Thales Alenia Space; OHB and SSTL). It is understood engineers have managed to restart another hydrogen clock that had stopped.\nEsa is also in contact with the Indian space agency which is using the same clocks in its sat-nav system. So far, the Indians have not experienced the same failures.\nMitigating actions\nA statement issued by the agency late on Wednesday gave additional details.\nIt appears the rubidium failures \"all seem to have a consistent signature, linked to probable short circuits, and possibly a particular test procedure performed on the ground\".\nThe maser clock failures are said to be better understood, with two likely causes, the second of which has caused most grief.\nThe Esa statement said this second scenario was \"related to the fact that when some healthy [hydrogen maser] clocks are turned off for long periods, they do not restart due to a change in clock characteristics\".\nActions are being taken to try to prevent further problems. These involve changing the way clocks are operated in orbit. Clocks about to fly are also likely to be refurbished, and future devices yet to be made will have design changes, the agency says.\nEsa is hopeful it can still launch the next four satellites in the constellation before the end of the year.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nSSTL\nImage caption,\nInside a satellite: The hydrogen maser clocks are the cylinders at bottom-right\nPrecise timing is at the core of all satellite-navigation systems.\nAtomic clocks generate the time code that is continuously transmitted to users on the ground to help them fix a position.\nThe passive hydrogen maser clocks in Galileo are determined to be accurate to one billionth of a second per day, or one second in three million years.\nThis performance ought to contribute to giving users fixes that have errors of a metre or less - significantly better than the standard open service from GPS.\nA fully operational Galileo system is regarded as a constellation of 24, split across three orbital planes in the sky. But spares are required also, and with one very early satellite in the constellation already considered very close to complete failure - for different reasons - there needs to be near-continuous production of spacecraft.\nThe four latest satellites went up as a quartet in November; more are set to follow later this year.\nGalileo is a project of the European Commission, the EU's executive branch. The EC employs Esa as its technical and procurement agent.\nThe development path to a \"European GPS\" has been a tortuous one. The project is years late, and the completion cost - expected to be some 7bn euros by 2020 - is substantially higher than that originally foreseen by EU member states.\nGalileo's atomic clocks by the numbers\nFirst four satellites launched were called In Orbit Validation (IOV) platforms\nThe next 14 were referred to as Full Operational Constellation (FOC) satellites\nThree of the rubidium clock failures have occurred on Galileo's FOC satellites\nFive of the hydrogen maser failures have occurred on the IOV spacecraft\nOne maser has stopped on an FOC satellite, giving nine failures in total\nThree of the four IOVs are affected; two of the 14 FOC satellites are affected\nEvery satellite has two hydrogen maser clocks and two rubidium clocks\nThat means a total of 72 atomic clocks are currently in orbit\nAll Galileo satellites presently have at least two working clocks\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nMore on this story\nTim Peake, Brexit and the UK space sector\nPublished\n16 July 2016\nGalileo launch for satellites 13 and 14\nPublished\n24 May 2016\nUK firm ships 'last' sat-nav payload\nPublished\n13 May 2016","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it discusses multiple clock failures on the Galileo satellite navigation system.

It was essential that the GPS be recovered.\"\nTwo hours later there were sighs of relief in mission control when the GPS re-engaged, fixing the problem and allowing Fossett to navigate for himself. The exact cause of the glitch has not been identified, but GlobalFlyer's engineers believe interference from the plane's other electrical equipment may have been to blame.\nOnce those tense two hours were over, the flight has continued according to plan, said project director Paul Moore. After 18 hours and 13 minutes of flying, Fossett had travelled 6,400 miles and was flying over the Algeria-Libya border at 2,000ft above his predicted maximum altitude of 45,000ft. He will reach the halfway point as he flies over India in approximately 12 hours.\nGlobalFlyer took off at 6.47pm local time (0047GMT) last night - just after sunset - from an airfield in the small city of Salina, Kansas, watched by an estimated 10,000 onlookers and more than 100 journalists from around the world. The GlobalFlyer team raced to prepare the plane for takeoff after turbulence and unfavourable winds earlier that afternoon prevented the aircraft from taking off, leaving a window of just 25 minutes before the light faded completely.\nSpeaking live at a press conference at 8am local time this morning from his 7ft cockpit, the GlobalFlyer pilot said: \"The flight is going very well. I am happy. There's going to be some beautiful scenery. I just crossed Madeira about 15 minutes ago.\"\nA Citation X chase plane, which can travel at nine-tenths the speed of sound, is making rendezvous with Fossett's plane at points throughout the trip. The two planes came into view of one another just off the coast of Morocco.\nWill Whitehorn, who was on board the Citation X as it accompanied GlobalFlyer, said: \"The aircraft looked like a beautiful swallow against the Atlas Mountains. Steve was on very good form ... he is very optimistic about the flight. He had a little bit of a rest when he was flying over the Atlantic.\"\nIf all goes to plan, Fossett will land back where he started in Kansas some time on Thursday morning, notching up another record to add to his clutch of more than 60 firsts.\nFossett is used to grappling with technological hitches during his numerous endurance feats, not least his around the world balloon attempts. In 1998 his balloon was caught in a thunderstorm off the Australian coast and ruptured at 8,800m (29,000ft), and Fossett crashed into the Coral Sea, a disaster he described as \"barely survivable\".\nAs Paul Moore put it, \"This is not the first time on one of these missions that we have had communications problems. In fact it's endemic.\"\nGlobalFlyer's aerodynamic design was dreamed up by Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites aircraft factory and cost $1.5m to design and build. Scaled Composites is also developing SpaceShipOne, the craft in which Sir Richard hopes to become the first space tourist and to launch Virgin Atlantic passengers into space.\nAside from the GPS problem, GlobalFlyer has so far lived up to expectations, chief engineer Jon Karkow of Scaled Composites said. It is constructed out of strong, lightweight materials to cope with the huge fuel payload that makes up 86% of its total weight of 10,045kg and to withstand the buffeting of the jet stream that will help it on its way.\nIts twin-tailed design consists of two fuel-filled booms - so fragile that Karkow compared them to watermelons - slung along the 114ft wingspan, dwarfing the central cockpit into which Fossett is crammed. He will urinate into bottles and dine only on diet chocolate milkshakes while trying to stay alert enough to pilot the plane as it rides the jet stream at an altitude of up to 51,000ft.\nThe first solo round-the-world trip, a seven-day, multi-stop voyage, was undertaken by Wiley Post in 1933. The first nonstop global flight without refuelling was made in 1986 by Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan, the brother of the GlobalFlyer designer.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it describes an incident where Steve Fossett's plane, GlobalFlyer, experienced a failure of its satellite navigation system (GPS) shortly after taking off on his record-breaking solo flight around the world.

The airline could not yet confirm what flights would operate on Tuesday but it is understood to expect some continuing impact on its schedules.\nGatwick said in a statement they would “operate a normal schedule” on Tuesday, but said passengers were “advised to check the status of their flight with the airline before travelling to the airport”.\nAccording to flight tracking sites, planes were delayed from about 11.30am. Nats confirmed the problem at about 12.10pm, saying it was “currently experiencing a technical issue” and had “applied traffic flow restrictions to maintain safety”.\nAfter announcing it had fixed the original issue, Nats said: “We are now working closely with airlines and airports to manage the flights affected as efficiently as possible. Our engineers will be carefully monitoring the system’s performance as we return to normal operations.\n“Our priority is always to ensure that every flight in the UK remains safe and we are sincerely sorry for the disruption this is causing. Please contact your airline for information on how this may affect your flight.”\nAccording to data from the analytics firm Cirium, 232 outbound flights from the UK and 271 inbound flights had been cancelled by 2.30pm, just under 10% of all services.\nA Heathrow spokesperson said schedules would “remain significantly disrupted for the rest of the day”. They added: “We ask passengers to only travel to the airport if their flight is confirmed as still operating. Teams across Heathrow are working as hard as they can to minimise the knock-on impacts and assist those whose journeys have been affected.”\nA departures board at Heathrow airport, London, shows cancellations of many British Airways flights. Photograph: Alberto Pezzali\/AP\nA British Airways spokesperson said: “Like all airlines using UK airspace, our flights have been severely disrupted … While Nats has now resolved the issue, it has created significant and unavoidable delays and cancellations. We’re working as hard as possible to get customers whose flights have been affected on their way again and have apologised for the huge inconvenience caused.”\nThe travel operator Tui warned its customers to expect “significant delays to some of our flights”.\nFlights from Ireland were also affected, with many due to cross UK airspace.\nAs well as holidaymakers, passengers affected by delays included British athletes and others returning from the World Athletics Championships in Hungary.\nThe BBC presenter Gabby Logan said on X that her plane was stuck on the runway at Budapest airport, adding: “After almost three weeks away from home I am hours from hugging my family. And have just been told UK airspace is shut. We could be here for 12 hours. So we sit on the plane and wait.”\nEngineers at Nats will have been racing against the clock to limit the fallout from the outage, potentially the most serious since its control centre in Swanwick, Hampshire, opened in 2002, falling on one of the key travel dates in the calendar.\nA computer glitch at Nats in 2014 affected flights until the following day, despite airspace being curtailed only for about an hour.\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats questioned the government’s apparent slow response before the transport secretary, Mark Harper, posted on X on Monday afternoon that ministers were “doing all we can”.\nHarper said: “UK airspace remains open but traffic flow restrictions are in place. Nats are working at pace to fix this and aviation minister [Charlotte Vere] and I are doing all we can to support them.”\nEarlier, the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, posted that the issue was “extremely concerning for passengers travelling in and out of the UK on one of the busiest days of the year”, adding that she was “surprised” by the lack of a ministerial statement.\nThe Lib Dems called on Rishi Sunak to convene a Cobra meeting. The party’s transport spokesperson, Wera Hobhouse, said: “Millions of holidaymakers could be facing huge disruption in the coming days due to this fault and we can’t risk this government being missing in action yet again.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a navigation system failure because it describes a technical meltdown in UK air traffic control, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of passengers being stranded or delayed.

This is the dynamic positioning: it holds the ship's position, that's not working.\n\"The electronic chart display becomes unusable. Even the ship's clock stops working.\"\nIn a series of tests, the GLA have found that almost every bit of kit on the boat uses GPS - even the onboard satellite entertainment system.\nMr Bransby says: \"You can imagine standing watch on this ship, it's the middle of the night, it's dark, it's foggy, you are in the English Channel, and then this happens.\n\"What do you do? You're in a right mess, basically.\"\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGLA\nImage caption,\nOn Galatea, a dual eLoran-GPS receiver is now in place\nLosing GPS is not a just theoretical problem.\nThe system works using a fleet of satellites orbiting high above the Earth, but the signal they transmit is weak and can be easily interfered with.\nOther sat-nav systems - such as Galileo in Europe and Glonass in Russia - have the same vulnerabilities, says Prof David Last from the Royal Institute of Navigation.\n\"A little bit of power from a jammer on the frequency used by GPS close to your receiver can deafen it, and it won't be able to hear the GPS signals,\" he says.\n\"For example, jamming is a real issue in Korea. There have now been three occasions when the North Koreans have transmitted high-powered jamming in South Korea.\"\nThe Sun too can knock satellite systems offline, he adds.\n\"It starts to transmit radio noise during solar storms, so intense that it either makes GPS positions wobble about or causes GPS to be lost across the entire sunlit side of the Earth.\"\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nNASA\/SDO\/GSFC\nImage caption,\nParticles hurled out by the Sun can knock satellites offline\nUntil now, there has been no \"Plan B\" if GPS goes wrong, but the GLA says eLoran will be an important tool.\nThe technology was developed during World War Two.\nThe Long Range Navigation system (Loran) was the brainchild of US scientists and was used to guide US Navy warships as battles raged in the Pacific.\nAfter the war ended, it was updated and renamed Loran-C, and adopted by mariners around the world - until GPS took over.\nNow though, rebranded as eLoran, its infrastructure has been upgraded to make it more accurate and it is making a comeback.\nWhile GPS transmitters are based in space, eLoran's are based on the ground.\nRadio stations transmit long-range radio waves. They use the same method as GPS to pinpoint position, but there are crucial differences.\nProfessor Last says: \"The neat thing is this: the radio frequencies which eLoran transmits are completely different from those of GPS.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nTHINKSTOCK\nImage caption,\nThe team says eLoran could be used as a back up for some of the other systems that use GPS\n\"The power levels, instead of being very weak, are very strong; the propagation of the radio signals is very different.\"\nHe adds: \"Everything that matters is very different (from GPS) so there is no common mode of failure. The result you get is a plug-and-play replacement for GPS.\"\nThe General Lighthouse Authorities have finished installing eLoran in seven ports along the east coast of Britain, completing the first phase of their roll out. It is now in place in Dover, Sheerness, Harwich and Felixstowe, Middleborough, Leith, Humber and Aberdeen.\nOnboard the Galatea, Martin Bransby demonstrates how a dual e-Loran and GPS receiver works.\nHe says: \"What happens inside this box is when we see some interference or jamming or a satellite failure, there is an algorithm that decides to swap over to eLoran. And it does that seamlessly.\"\nFor now, eLoran is being tested for shipping, but it could also play a role on land for the vast array of systems that use GPS.\nProf Last says a back-up is long overdue.\n\"Most people think of GPS as the system that runs their car sat-nav and tells their smartphone where it is,\" he tells the BBC's Click.\n\"But there is probably no area of industry, of commerce, or telecoms, that isn't now dependent on GPS. And if we lose GPS we lose them all.\"\nBut the system may never go global.\nThe US Coast Guard is busy decommissioning the existing eLoran infrastructure. And in Europe, the governments of Norway and France have said they will cease operations next year.\nCommercial companies may take up the reins, but without support from some of the biggest shipping nations, the eLoran safety net may not be around to rescue everyone.\nFind out more on the Click website.

Most modern tractors rely on GPS for automatic steering. The satellite enables guided accuracy and self-drive within two centimetres for tasks such as sowing crops.\nMichael Casey, the general manager of agriculture cooperative company Vantage NSW, said that farmers with a cellular modem – like a 5G connection – in their cab were still able to connect to the GPS system, while those who did not have mobile internet were not. The outage only affected the satellite that sends the correction signal – which corrects errors in GPS mapping and allows tractors to be self-driving – and the broader network remained intact.\n‘Digital divide’: report finds some Australian rural mobile data speeds 90% slower than urban\nRead more\n“So if you could find an alternative way to get that correction signal or another correction signal to that machine, then you could maintain the high-accuracy operation,” Casey said.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\n“In some cases, if they had a cellular modem, we were able to feed them the correction through, say, a hotspot in their phone.\n“If it was older equipment and it didn’t have connectivity, then you had to revert back to what we call uncorrected, which will still allow you to perform the functions but it doesn’t place the machinery in the field in the exact location that you need. So you kind of lose some efficiency.”\nCasey said farmers required accurate GPS information to reduce soil compaction and support crop growth.\nHe said he and his team have been pushing for customers to add cellular connectivity to their machines.\n“That’s what’s enabled us to get ourselves and a lot of customers out of trouble,” he said. “You’re not coming in from satellite, you’re coming in from the internet.”\n“So although you still require satellites for positioning, the particular correctional satellite becomes redundant if you have the stream coming in over an internet feed.”\nWhile this solution seems simple, it’s limited by Australia’s poor network coverage. If service is patchy and unable to be reached on your property, this alternative would be redundant.\nThe NSW Farmers association said the reliance on technology had brought efficiencies, but it also made the industry vulnerable.\nSign up to Afternoon Update\nFree daily newsletter\nOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a major problem we need to come to terms with and really harden ourselves against.”\nJock Graham, who farms near Gundagai, said that when you look at the screen on most farm machinery that relies on this technology you can see 15 different satellites listed. “So I guess from a regular farmer’s point of view, we probably didn’t realise that it needed just the main one, and that those other ones were supplementary,” he said.\nGraham’s tractor was down for three days during the peak of sowing season, where each day of delays costs money. He is hoping the system is improved so it won’t happen again.\n“I’d like to see obviously redundancy in the system, so should there be an outage in one satellite, there’s a secondary way it can work that keeps everything online,” he said. “Because in this day and age, that’s what everyone has to do to keep their systems up and running.

But what caused it?\nWhat was the ‘technical failure’?\nThe automatic flight planning system used by Nats, the company that provides national air traffic control services in the UK, was out of action for several hours on Monday. Airspace was not closed, but the number of planes in the sky was severely restricted while the automated system was down.\nWhat caused it to fail?\nNats says that the failure was triggered by a single piece of data in a flight plan that was wrongly input to its system by an unnamed airline.\nWhat are flight plans and how are they filed?\nFlight plans in effect are a plane’s timing and chosen route, and for most regular short-haul flights they are completely standardised. An airline’s flight operations team files them electronically to air traffic controllers well before takeoff, and pilots are responsible for checking them and updating them if necessary.\nDoes Nats not have a backup system?\nYes it does. According to its chief executive, Martin Rolfe, “several layers of backup” exist, but apparently the dodgy data caused the secondary automatic processing system to be suspended “to ensure that no incorrect safety-related information could be presented to an air traffic controller or impact the rest of the air traffic system”.\nHow could just one faulty flight plan cause this?\nNats has not really explained this yet. Willie Walsh, the director general of the global airlines body, Iata, said it was “staggering” that inputting a single flight plan incorrectly could knock the whole system over. Pilots say plans can frequently be rejected. Rolfe said the whole system did not fail and that airspace was slowed down rather closed down, but that the computers were “designed to fail safely” to isolate the problem.\nAnd on a bank holiday. Definitely not a cyber-attack?\n“No indication” according to Nats. Despite the timing, which has increased speculation after similar airline woes occurred at peak holiday seasons in the past, aviation experts said it was unlikely, even before the transport secretary, Mark Harper, said the government had ruled it out.\nHas this happened often?\nNot quite at this scale and duration. The only comparable incident at Nats was in December 2014 when flights were held for about an hour during a glitch.\nSign up to Business Today\nFree daily newsletter\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nWhat happens next?\nNats is investigating internally and has to report to the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which has promised to get an initial report to Harper by Monday. Rolfe told broadcasters on Wednesday that this particular error should not recur: “We understand the way the system didn’t handle the data … the way it failed, if you like,” he said.\n‘We’re £1,000 out of pocket’: travellers affected by UK air traffic chaos\nRead more\nWho pays for the fallout?\nAt the moment, airlines and their passengers. Many people face additional bills and lost holidays, possibly alleviated by travel insurance if they have a decent policy, and airlines have incurred more costs and lost revenue. Airlines have the legal duty to accommodate, feed and eventually fly passengers whose flights have been cancelled or severely disrupted, but compensation is not due because the fault was beyond their control. Walsh estimates that the lost revenue, extra work and additional flights have cost airlines £100m.\nWill Nats have to pay compensation?\nAt the moment, no. Walsh told the BBC: “I think there is a great opportunity post-Brexit to look at the way passenger compensation is dealt with to ensure that the people who are responsible for the delays and cancellations ultimately bear the costs.” Given airline and passenger anger, it is not impossible that some kind of review of compensation rules could be ordered.\nWho owns Nats?\nNats is a public-private company, 49% owned by the state, which has a golden share. It is licensed by the CAA to run national airspace from its HQ in Swanwick, Hampshire, and funded via hundreds of millions of pounds in overflight fees paid by airlines.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure.

It is a sophisticated set-up using the car’s navigation system and airbag sensors, and it has its own mobile phone sim card.\nBut almost immediately after VAG Group introduced SOS systems in its cars in 2017, buyers of VWs, Skodas and Audis started reporting intermittent problems.\nGuardian research suggests that rather than the matter being resolved by the manufacturer, almost three years on, the problem has not been solved.\nFrustrated owners have described having to make repeated and often fruitless trips back to dealers, costing them time and fuel, and being without their cars for sometimes weeks at a time.\nIn the most recent cases, some drivers have reported that their car’s satnav and in-car phone system have been rendered useless. At least one owner of an affected car has reported being told that the problems affect a significant batch of cars made during 2020.\nIt appears to me that Skoda is knowingly selling cars that have this fault\nFlora Ellison\nIn May last year, VW was temporarily forced to halt deliveries of its latest Golf because the eCall emergency assist function was not working reliably. In April 2020, Skoda recalled and repaired 26,000 Kamiq and Scala models after finding that the system was not working as it should.\nFlora Ellison, a teacher who lives in south London, says she has been told by her dealer that he has “no idea” how to fix her Skoda Karoq sports utility vehicle, which started playing up only four days after she had picked up the brand-new £22,000 car in December.\n“You can be driving along and out of nowhere the warning light will flash up telling you the SOS system has failed and telling you to take the car to the dealer,” she says. “The car’s satellite navigation system goes haywire and you can no longer hear the other person when using the hands-free phone system.”\nDespite numerous visits to the dealer, she says the problem is no nearer being fixed. She says staff eventually admitted to her that this is a well-known fault, and as a result she has asked the dealer to replace her car.\n“I’ve now been told that this problem has affected many vehicles within the fleet – and that they have no idea how to fix it,” she says.\nAlmost immediately after VAG Group introduced SOS systems to its cars in 2017, buyers of Skodas, VWs and Audis started reporting intermittent problems.\nPhotograph: Clynt Garnham Business\/Alamy\n“I rely on my car to get to work as the public transport options are very limited. When I first took the car in they gave the impression that they hadn’t seen the problem before. Only when it persisted did the true picture emerge. It would appear to me that Skoda is knowingly selling cars that have this fault. I really like the car in every other respect, which makes the whole thing even more frustrating.”\nAudi owners were the first to report problems back in 2017, and there has been a steady stream of complaints from VAG car buyers since, with online posts about VWs, Audis and Skodas.\n“My new Q7 had the same problem less than 12 hours after collecting my car from the dealer somewhere mid-January 2017,” wrote Isn on the Audi forum in 2017. “I had to send it in for 1.5 weeks to change the coaxial and antenna. Unfortunately the problem came back after a few days and I have to send it back to the dealer again. I have the feeling that Audi have no idea what is causing the error on the emergency call.”\nSkoda owners described the same experience, followed by VW Golf buyers – again often reporting that it started within days of them picking up their new car at the dealership.\nA handful of VW T-Roc owners, some who had only owned their cars for two weeks, were complaining about the problem last November. It also affected Caravelle owners, and at least one owner of VW’s ID3 electric car.\nMore recently, owners have required a new replacement control unit that in some cases has taken two months to fix\nGuardian Money sent links to these complaints to Skoda. It said that without knowing the details of each of the cases, or what was causing the fault in Ellison’s car, it “wouldn’t be constructive or helpful to comment or make comparisons”. It is now examining her car and has given her a replacement.\nVW, the parent company, declined to comment.\nOne of the problems that dealers have apparently had has been diagnosing the fault.

Get news about destinations opening and closing, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\nNew York\nCNN\n — \nThe airline industry slowly resumed service after a Federal Aviation Administration system outage caused thousands of flight delays and cancellations across the United States Wednesday.\nThe FAA briefly halted all domestic flight departures across the US Wednesday morning, lifting the ground stop around 9 a.m. ET after it restored a system that provides pilots with pre-flight safety notices.\nBut airlines continued to delay or cancel flights because of ongoing congestion.\nBy late Wednesday afternoon, the FAA’s website was still showing ground delays at some airports.\nMajor US carriers including United Airlines, Delta and American Airlines all said they had grounded flights in response to the situation. United and Delta have issued travel waivers in response to the outage. American Airlines said its customers could rebook their flights Wednesday and Thursday without additional fees.\nFlightAware, which tracks delays and cancellations, showed more than 9,500 flights to, from and within the United States as being delayed as of 6 p.m. ET, and more than 1,300 flights canceled.\nSouthwest, which canceled thousands of flights after Christmas following a systemwide meltdown, was hit hard, with more than 400 canceled flights. About 10% of Southwest’s Wednesday flights had been canceled and about half delayed as of 6 p.m. ET.\nSouthwest operations had resumed by mid-morning, the airline said.\n“As a result of the FAA’s outage, we anticipate some schedule adjustments will be made throughout the day,” Southwest said in a statement, encouraging travelers to check their flight status online or via the airline’s app. Southwest has also issued a waiver allowing travelers to change their flights.\nAmerican Airlines was also hit hard: Including feeder airlines that use regional jets, American said it had canceled nearly 400 flights as of midday Wednesday.\nCause of outage under investigation\nThe affected system, Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM), sends alerts to pilots to let them know of conditions that could affect the safety of their flights. It is separate from the air traffic control system that keeps planes a safe distance from each other, but it’s another critical tool for air safety.\nIn a statement Wednesday night, the FAA acknowledged that a corrupted file had led to the outage, confirming CNN’s reporting.\n“Our preliminary work has traced the outage to a damaged database file. At this time, there is no evidence of a cyberattack,” the FAA said.\nThat echoed what Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN’s Kate Bolduan in an interview Wednesday.\nWhat is NOTAM, the FAA computer system that halted all US flights?\n“There’s been no direct evidence or indication of [a cyberattack] but we are also not going rule that out until we have a clear and better understanding of what’s taken place,” Buttigieg said.\nThe 90-minute ground stop of flights across the United States Wednesday morning was implemented out of an “abundance of caution.” Buttigieg said that there were “irregularities” overnight in the safety messages that were going out to pilots that reflected a larger issue.\nHere's what led to today's FAA ground stoppage\nButtigieg, who has been hard on airlines over their staffing and technology issues in the last year, said the Transportation Department and Federal Aviation Administration would “own” responsibility for their failures.\n“No, these kinds of disruptions should not happen and my primary interest now that we’ve gotten through the immediate disruptions of the morning is understanding exactly how this was possible and exactly what steps are needed to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Buttigieg said.\nButtigieg said via Twitter Wednesday morning that he had ordered an “after-action process to determine root causes and recommend next steps.”\nNav Canada also reported an outage of Canada’s NOTAM system on Wednesday. That nearly three-hour outage did not impact flight operations and its cause is under investigation, the air navigation service provider said.\n“At this time, we do not believe the cause is related to the FAA outage experienced earlier today,” Nav Canada said in a statement.\nA traveler looks at a flight board with delays and cancellations at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on January 11.\nPatrick Semansky\/AP\nAnother aviation meltdown\nIt’s the second time in less than a month that frequent flyer Erin Potrzebowski has had her Southwest flight canceled as part of mass flight cancellations.\n“I’ve never experienced anything like the event today and like the Southwest event from a couple of weeks ago,” said Potrzebowski, who was waiting for a rescheduled flight to New Orleans at Chicago Midway International Airport on Wednesday.\n“It’s common to experience weather-related issues but I’ve never experienced mass cancellations that impact the entire country,” Potrzebowski said.\nCalls came swiftly for aviation system upgrades.\n“Today’s FAA catastrophic system failure is a clear sign that America’s transportation network desperately needs significant upgrades,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.\n“Americans deserve an end-to-end travel experience that is seamless and secure. And our nation’s economy depends on a best-in-class air travel system.”\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is currently without a permanent leader, and President Biden’s nominee for the role has faced criticism.\nInvestment in the agency is set to be addressed this year by Congress when the five-year FAA Reauthorization Act signed in 2018 expires.\nWhat should I do if my flight has been canceled or delayed?\nInternational impacts\nInternational flights bound for the United States were continuing to take off from Amsterdam and Paris Wednesday despite the situation. A Schiphol Airport spokesperson told CNN that “a workaround had been issued” and flights were still departing from Amsterdam.\nParis’ Charles de Gaulle airport was not seeing cancellations, but delays were expected, according to the airport’s press office. Frankfurt Airport also told CNN it had not been impacted.\nA London Heathrow Airport spokesperson told CNN early Wednesday that they were “not aware of canceled flights and that flights to the US had left recently,” however, there were passenger reports of significant delays.\nShabnam Amini told CNN that she and other travelers had been sitting on board Americans Airlines flight 51 to Dallas for almost three hours at Heathrow because of the FAA outage.\nShe said they had been informed that there were delays but were still boarded onto the aircraft.\nCommercial airline pilots use NOTAMS for real-time information on flight hazards and restrictions. The FAA stipulates NOTAMS are not to be relied on as a sole source of information, and so some flights may be able to satisfy safety requirements by using other data.\nWednesday’s incident comes on the heels of another aviation crisis. A huge winter storm over the end-of-year holidays caused extensive disruption and helped trigger the Southwest Airlines meltdown that affected thousands of passengers.\nWhile Wednesday’s flight cancellations at Southwest are a problem for its customers, it was nowhere near as bad as what it experienced from December 21 through December 29, when about 16,000 flights, or nearly half of its schedule, had to be canceled due to lack of available staff.\nCNN’s Barry Neild, Paul P.

The satellites were the last of a batch of 24 at the heart of Russia’s GLONASS, or Global Navigation System, its answer to the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS).\nSETBACK TO SATELLITE SOVEREIGNTY\nThe launch failure could delay what Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “satellite navigation sovereignty,” and Russia’s attempt to stimulate its economy by having domestic firms mass produce GLONASS consumer devices.\nThe state has spent $2 billion in the last 10 years on the project, being developed by oil-to-telecoms holding company Sistema.\nThe Russian government has also proposed a series of protectionist, anti-GPS measures to encourage GLONASS’ adoption.\nRoscosmos said on Sunday before the launch failure that GLONASS would become operational in six weeks.\nIn October, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said Russia was looking to introduce duties of around 25 percent by 2012 on the import of mobile phones without the GLONASS navigation system.\nIn August, the head of the GLONASS operator, Alexander Gurko, said that Nokia, Motorola and Qualcomm were in talks with Russian chip manufacturers about the mass production of GLONASS handheld devices..\nGurko also said that the Russian satellite navigation market, estimated at only $1 billion in 2010, would grow to about $10 billion in 2014 and that GLONASS would also market its technology in India, the Middle East and ex-Soviet countries.\nBut the general director of M2M Electronics, a subcontractor specializing in microelectronics for the Glonass programme, said the failure to launch the satellites was “no great tragedy.”\nEvgeny Belyanko told Russian state-owned news channel Rossiya 24 that existing satellites already covered all of Russia, had good coverage up to polar latitudes, and “perhaps not quite as good” coverage of the equatorial region. “Therefore the absence of these three satellites ... will not have any serious consequences.\nThere are currently 26 Glonass satellites in orbit, many of them launched by the Proton-M carrier.

In the event of such an issue our systems are designed to isolate the problem and prioritise continued safe air traffic control.\n“This is what happened yesterday. At no point was UK airspace closed, but the number of flights was significantly reduced. Initial investigations into the problem show it relates to some of the flight data we received.\n“Our systems, both primary and the backups, responded by suspending automatic processing to ensure that no incorrect safety-related information could be presented to an air traffic controller or impact the rest of the air traffic system. There are no indications that this was a cyber-attack.”\nRishi Sunak said: “I know people will be enormously frustrated by the disruption that’s impacting them … The transport secretary is in constant dialogue with all the industry participants, he will be talking to airlines specifically later today and making sure that they support passengers to get home as quickly as possible.”\nThe prime minister’s spokesperson said airlines had a responsibility to “get customers back to where they should be”, by either finding alternative travel for cancelled flights, or providing meals and accommodation until a flight departed.\nThe transport secretary, Mark Harper, told the BBC: “Airlines have a responsibility either to get people back on a flight to get them home or to pay for them to be accommodated … People can pay for reasonable costs themselves and claim back from their airlines.”\nBut the global airline body Iata said the situation showed the passenger rights system was not fit for purpose.\nThe organisation’s director general, Willie Walsh, a former British Airways boss, said there had been an “unacceptable failure”, adding: “Nats has crucial questions to answer about their responsibility for this fiasco. Airlines will bear significant sums in care and assistance charges, on top of the costs of disruption to crew and aircraft schedules. But it will cost Nats nothing.”\nFlight plans had to be input manually by controllers on Monday to allow air services to continue at all, while engineers struggled for almost four hours to find and fix the fault.\nEasyJet said on Tuesday night it was now operating normally, and would be putting on additional “repatriation flights” from holiday destinations later in the week, as well as switching its bigger planes to affected routes to provide more seats.\nHarper met industry representatives including Nats, airlines, airports and the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, on Tuesday afternoon. He subsequently apologised again for the disruption, expressed gratitude to airlines and promised to offer more support.\nHe said: “Airlines are clear about their responsibilities to their customers, and I stand ready to provide further appropriate support from the government should the industry request it.”\nHarper has ruled out a cyber-attack as a possible cause, but said the CAA would be reporting to him on the incident, adding that it would “take some days to get completely everybody back to where they should be”.\nPassengers around Britain and Europe were weighing the costs of the chaos, with some returning to airports to find their flights cancelled for a second day.\nMost of the early morning flights operated at Gatwick by easyJet departed several hours later than timetabled.\nBritish Airways cancelled 85 flights on Tuesday and said there would be more on Wednesday, when it would continue to allow passengers free rebooking should they wish to avoid the disruption. It said passengers should continue to check the status of flights before coming to the airport. It was also taking out business class seats on short-haul flights to get more people airborne.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it discusses the fallout from a UK air traffic control failure.

It said urgent steps to prevent problems must be taken by Friday “to ensure critical oxygen systems are not damaged, compromising patient safety and the whole hospital”.\nBarts NHS trust, which runs the Royal London hospital in the capital, said on Tuesday it has asked doctors to limit the amount of oxygen they give to patients to safeguard supplies while keeping patients safe. A problem with oxygen pressure last week at Queen’s hospital in Havering saw doctors move 25 patients by ambulance to the nearby King George hospital in Ilford to keep them safe.\nThere was also a critical incident with the oxygen supply at Watford general hospital on Saturday, when staff had to tell the public to stay away and some patients were moved out to prevent the system failing.\nThe NHS England warning states: “Some hospitals are drawing more oxygen from their tanks than the maximum flow for which they were designed. This carries the risk of icing that could cause flow to drop unexpectedly, compromising supply to patients and\/or permanent damage to the system.”\nOne clinician working at Barts NHS trust said they had been told to keep patient oxygen saturation levels between 92% and 94%. The trust said this was “clinically safe”.\n“We have reviewed the targets on oxygen percentage for patients to ensure responsible oxygen consumption across our hospitals,” a trust spokesperson said. “Rather than aim for unnecessarily high physiological values we are aiming to keep oxygen levels at what is a safe level for each patient. This does allow us in some cases to reduce oxygen flow rates to the devices we are using.”\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts, said: “We have all been looking at ventilator capacity and saying that’s key, and that’s right. But we’ve now discovered that the capacity of a hospital’s internal oxygen system to support is potentially just as important. If a hospital doesn’t have enough capacity to ventilate patients, it will look to transfer patients to its nearest neighbour.”\nProf Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said the oxygen supply problems were a worry that “shows that this is a major pandemic that’s taxing the NHS like nothing has ever taxed it before”.\nA spokesperson for NHS Estates said: “Hospital oxygen tanks are fuller than normal, having been filled more frequently in recent weeks as part of preparations for patients with coronavirus, so there is sufficient oxygen supply available. Individual hospitals received guidance in February and again this week on how to safely manage engineering and their increased oxygen usage.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of Navigation system failure.

Our teams have been working tirelessly to get the vast majority of customers on their way, with most of our flights departing.”\nIt added: “Our flights are returning to normal. However, there may be some knock-on operational disruption.” The airline was still advising passengers to check for flight information on its website before travelling to the airport.\n⁦@British_Airways⁩ ⁦@BBCNews⁩ - here we go again!

In a ballot of the pilots’ union Balpa, 93% of the airline’s 4,000 pilots voted in favour of taking industrial action after rejecting a three-year pay deal. BA lost a legal challenge to the strikes, which are expected to cost the airline £40m a day.\nIf BA pilots go ahead with strikes, the likely disruption could coincide with five days of walkouts announced late on Wednesday by Ryanair pilots who are members of the Balpa union.\nBalpa said that “decades of Ryanair refusing to deal with unions” had led to members voting for a 48-hour strike beginning on 22 August and a 72-hour strike from 2 September.\n“No pilot wants to spoil the public’s travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice,” said Balpa’s general secretary, Brian Strutton.\nA third strike action, by Heathrow ground staff, could still go ahead on 22 and 23 August unless talks result in a compromise.\nBA had other problems this week after 200 people had to be evacuated from a British Airways flight after smoke poured into the cabin minutes before it was due to land in Valencia.

It flew horizontally and began to come apart in flames, crashing in a ball of fire near the launch pad.\nRussian Prime Minster Dmitry Medvedev, who has said that Russia has lost 10 satellites in seven failed launches in just over one year, ordered tighter controls put in place to avoid more embarrassing mishaps, his spokeswoman told Interfax.\nThe crash, which echoes the costly loss of three navigation satellites in 2010, will further damage the reputation of Russia’s once-pioneering space program, cause delays in launches and threaten its hold on some 40 percent of the market for space launches.\nRussia’s space agency Roscosmos said the accident had been caused by the emergency switch-off of the rocket’s engines 17 seconds into the flight. The shutdown could have been caused by a problem with the engine or the guidance system, the state-run RIA news agency reported.\nThe rocket contained 172 tonnes (1 tonne=1.102 tons) of highly toxic heptyl propellant, Kazakh Emergencies Minister Vladimir Bozhko told an emergency government meeting.\nTalgat Musabayev, head of Kazakhstan’s space agency Kazcosmos, said nitric oxide - a product of burning heptyl - was much less toxic for humans. He said it was raining in the area, so toxic clouds would probably not reach the town of Baikonur some 60 km (38 miles) away.\nHowever, the authorities instructed locals to stay at home and not to open windows, and ordered to close shops and public catering, said Kazakh Interior Minister Kalmukhambet Kasymov.\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\nThe estimated loss from the three satellites, meant for the trouble Glonass satellite navigation system, was about $200 million, Rossiya-24 reported.\nRussia plans to spend more than 300 billion roubles ($9.1 billion) by 2020 on Glonass, its answer to the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) system.\nThe system, first conceived by the Soviet Union more than 40 years ago, has been plagued by failed launches, including one in 2010 in which three satellites were also lost, and by suspicions of corruption and embezzlement. Its chief designer was dismissed last year during a fraud investigation.\nRussia’s workhorse Proton rocket, known at the time under its UR-500 code, made its first test flights in the mid-1960s.\nIt was originally designed as an intercontinental ballistic missile to carry a nuclear warhead targeting the Soviet Union’s Cold War foe the United States. But it was never deployed as a nuclear weapon.\nSeveral crashes of Proton rockets accompanied by spills of heptyl have led to temporary strains in relations between Russia and Kazakhstan.\nRussia is increasing spending on space and plans to send a probe to the moon in 2015, but the pioneering program that put the first man in space in 1961 has been plagued in recent years by setbacks, including botched satellite launches and a failed attempt to send a probe to a moon of Mars.

Kuala Lumpur is 6,611km northwest.\nAccording to a report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) published on Wednesday, the problem occurred when faulty earmuffs prompted the captain and first officer to swap their usual pre-flight checks.\nOrdinarily, the report said, the captain would conduct an external inspection of the plane while the first officer stayed in the cockpit and, among other tasks, completed the position initialisation and alignment procedures.\nOn this day, however, the captain’s ear protection was not available so he took over the cockpit tasks, which included entering their current coordinates, usually given as the coordinates of the departure gate, into the plane’s internal navigation system.\nThe report said that the captain manually copied the coordinates from a sign outside the cockpit window into the system, and that later analysis showed a “data entry error”.\nInstead of entering the longitude as 151° 9.8’ east, or 15109.8 in the system, he incorrectly entered it as 15° 19.8’ east, or 01519.8.\n“This resulted in a positional error in excess of 11,000km, which adversely affected the aircraft’s navigation systems and some alerting systems,” the ATSB said.\nThe report said the crew had “a number of opportunities to identify and correct the error” but did not notice it until they had become airborne and started to track in the wrong direction.\nThose opportunities included a flag or message that flashed up on the captain’s screen during crosscheck of the cockpit preparations, which the first officer later told ATSB investigators he had seen but not mentioned because it was “too quick to interpret”; and three separate chimes which, because they were not accompanied by a message from the computer, were ignored.\nA fifth sign that something was wrong came in the form of an alert blaring: “TERRAIN! TERRAIN!” This was not ignored – both pilots said it had “startled” them. But, as that alert meant they were about to hit something and they could see the way ahead was clear, and as the busy runways at Sydney airport made the full response to such an alert “undesirable”, they pressed on.\nHowever, when autopilot engaged at 410 feet, it tracked the plane left, toward the flight path of another runway.\nBoth the captain and the first officer tried to fix the system but “attempts to troubleshoot and rectify the problem resulted in further degradation of the navigation system, as well as to the aircraft’s flight guidance and flight control systems”, the ATSB said.\nThey requested to return to Sydney but told air traffic control they were were only capable of making a visual approach – that is, landing without the assistance of their navigation systems.\nAir traffic control replied that since the weather and visibility had worsened in Sydney, they should instead head to Melbourne.\nThe plane spent three hours on the ground in Melbourne fixing the problem before departing for Kuala Lumpur, where it arrived at 10.20pm local time, six hours behind schedule.\nThe ATSB said “even experienced flight crew are not immune from data entry errors” and advised AirAsia to upgrade its flight systems to assist in preventing or detecting such errors in future.\nAir Asia said it upgraded its flight management systems on its Air Asia X planes, sent a training bulletin to staff emphasising the correct operation and alignment of the flight data system, and had briefed all pilots on the findings of its internal investigation.\n“AirAsia X would like to stress that we have in place robust management systems to monitor and prevent similar incidents from reoccurring,” it said in a statement on Wednesday.\n“We also wish to reiterate that we have regularly passed safety and security audits conducted by various international regulators, including the IATA Operational Safety Audit.

{"num":39,"Time":"Sat 2 Jul 2022 20.39 CEST","Title":"Food delivery drivers fired after ‘cut-price’ GPS app sent them on ‘impossible’ routes","Content":"Drivers who deliver food and drink for Just Eat have been fired after being misdirected by a cut-price GPS system, according to the union representing them.\nThe couriers, who work for Stuart, a company that supplies drivers to some of the biggest restaurant and retail names in Britain, told the Observer they were sacked by pro-forma email after being mislocated by the GPS system or deviating from impossible or dangerous routes.\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claims there are dozens of couriers for Stuart in cities across the country, from Exeter to Leeds, who have lost their jobs this way. Those who spoke to the Observer described their hurt at this treatment and anxiety about their ability to pay rent, bills and basic expenses as the cost of living continues to rise.\nAlex Marshall, president of the IWGB, said the cases were “among the more egregious examples of a gig economy that is increasingly squeezing workers as much as possible and then just dropping them without any accountability.\n“The decision to use this GPS system is about cutting costs for Stuart but the ramifications for couriers are huge,” he suggested.\n“People are losing their livelihoods in an instant and those that are still working are putting their lives at risk.” Evidence shared with the Observer suggests Stuart brought its GPS system in-house as a cost-cutting measure and that it is aware of problems.\nIn a direct-message conversation on Twitter, shared with the Observer, a Stuart senior manager can be seen telling a courier: “Stuart has an internally built directions service and it’s not great. We used to use Google Maps directions but they put the price up 10x.”\nWhen the courier replies “people get terminated for allegedly deviating from routes and you just said it is wrong”, the manager acknowledges: “it’s not perfect yes [sic].”\nUntil May, Adnan Odawa, 35, worked full-time for the app-based Stuart, beginning each day at McDonald’s in Sutton Coldfield. One Tuesday morning he made the 10-mile cycle ride from his home in Birmingham as usual, taking out his phone on arrival to log in to the app as he had done for the past three years. But that morning, he had a new message: his account had been terminated and his access to the platform blocked.\nIn a pro-forma email seen by the Observer, Stuart told Odawa that several of his deliveries had been “flagged for severe delays caused by excessive detours”, including three order numbers listed in the email.\nOdawa did not recognise two of them and the third related to a job where he had arrived on time and made the delivery but, he says, the in-app GPS incorrectly located the address, forcing him to cycle almost a mile to the wrong location to mark the job as complete. “I was shocked,” he said. “I thought: ‘If you’ve got a problem with me for the first time in three years, you could at least send me a message and let me know.’”\nFor Odawa, conceding to the GPS was the only option. The app includes a chat function for couriers to resolve problems on shift, but when Odawa used this previously he had been left waiting for up to an hour, unable to get through to a human.\nScreenshots shared with the Observer show couriers similarly pleading their cases to the chatbot, which repeatedly replies: “No worries, an agent will take it from here” and: “This is an automated message, please do not reply” before asking them to rate the conversation by clicking on an emoji.\nAfter his employment was terminated, Odawa repeatedly emailed Stuart but received only standardised emails in return, stating that his request for reinstatement had been denied and the decision was final.\nMarshall said the IWGB had investigated 55 cases since March 2021 and that, in most instances, couriers were given no opportunity to review the decision with human involvement.\nAn online appeal form was introduced in late 2021 after union campaigning, but it states terminations will only be reviewed where couriers can provide “objective proof” they were not at fault. Stuart can legally dismiss couriers without warning or reason as they are classed as independent contractors, not employees.\nScreenshots and photographs shared with the Observer show a driver in Plymouth being routed through a building site, with warning signs visible, and a south-east London driver being sent through a road closure. Others show a driver in east London being directed to break traffic rules by turning right despite a no-right-turn sign.\nWhile less well known than Deliveroo or Uber, Stuart – a subsidiary of the parcels company DPD – is a leading gig economy player. It is active in more than 100 cities worldwide, most notably in the UK as a subcontractor for Just Eat in England and Wales. Just Eat declined to comment.\nSandeep Salgotra, 36, worked full-time with Stuart in Leicester until he was terminated in April because of “GPS blocking and manipulation”. Prior to his dismissal, he claims he received a number of warnings about the issue, which he did not understand, as he was unable to find any problem with his GPS connection.\nWhen Stuart did not respond to his queries, he says, he changed his network provider. When the warnings continued, he spent £1,500 on a new phone but nothing changed. Eventually he received a response from Stuart, seen by the Observer, telling him: “You do not need to worry about being flagged at this stage … For now, everything is fine with your status.” Two weeks later, he says, he was terminated.\n“It’s been really painful and I am struggling; I support my family as my wife isn’t working,” said Salgotra. “I’ve never done anything wrong in my life. I don’t understand why Stuart is treating us this way.”\nOther couriers who spoke to the Observer after being terminated for routing and GPS reasons similarly described confusion over the cause of their terminations and frustration at the company’s refusal to respond to messages or engage in discussion.\nOne courier says he sent several emails to Stuart explaining that his phone connection sometimes dropped out in the rural area he delivered in, but did not receive a response. An appeal he submitted in February has so far gone unanswered, he says.\nAnother courier received a termination email citing “GPS manipulation” while in hospital recovering from a road accident that happened during the previous night’s shift. His subsequent emails, which included pictures of his written-off motorcycle, went unanswered.\nMarshall said terminated couriers were “assumed without question to be acting fraudulently and denied a fair and proper process”. Many new couriers are recent migrant workers new to an area who need the GPS system and are therefore vulnerable to its faults, he points out.\nThe union says the GPS issues are just one of many concerns for Stuart’s couriers, some of whom are engaged in the gig economy’s longest-running strike over pay and conditions. Earlier in the strike, Stuart agreed to resolve an issue that had resulted in the unfair termination of couriers whose insurance details had been incorrectly recorded by the company.\n‘Snoop Dogg is advertising Just Eat, but it is me that has to deliver it’: the courier leading the UK’s longest gig-economy strike\nRead more\nA spokesperson for Stuart said the company “takes the issue of courier off-boarding very seriously”, adding: “We can’t comment publicly on individual cases, but we only make the decision to off-board when we have plenty of evidence to support our decision, without exceptions.”\nThey added: “Stuart operates an appeal process that is followed in every case where an appeal is submitted.”\nFor the couriers, the effects of terminations run deep. “I had to tell my kids we can’t go anywhere this year, we’re just staying in England,” said Odawa, a father of three.\n“[Stuart] act like we are nothing; they just stop replying and carry on.”\n\nThis article was amended on 3 July 2022. Due to an editing error, an earlier version said that drivers were forced to complain about their dismissal via an automatic chatbot. In fact the drivers had to use the chatbot when questioning the faulty GPS. After dismissal they were locked out of the app.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"Food delivery drivers fired due to misdirection by a GPS system.\",\n\"Drivers reported being sacked for being mislocated by the GPS system or deviating from impossible or dangerous routes.\",\n\"The GPS system is described as a 'cut-price' system that the company Stuart uses for food delivery drivers.\",\n\"The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claims numerous couriers across various cities lost their jobs due to GPS-related issues.\",\n\"The news highlights the consequences for couriers, including job loss and financial stress.\",\n\"Instances of drivers being routed through dangerous or impossible routes, such as a driver being routed through a building site and being sent through a road closure.\",\n\"The article discusses couriers' frustration with the company's response to GPS-related problems and terminations.\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/jul\/02\/food-delivery-drivers-fired-after-cut-price-gps-app-sent-them-on-impossible-routes","query_name":"updated_file_Navigation_system_failure.xlsx"}
{"num":40,"Time":"Tue 12 May 2020 21.18 CEST","Title":"Testing for coronavirus in UK care homes a ‘complete system failure’","Content":"Care home operators have accused the UK government of “a complete system failure” over testing for Covid-19 after officials repeatedly deflected responsibility for the task and left vulnerable residents unchecked.\nAs ministers admitted it will be more than three weeks before all homes are offered tests, care home managers said lives have been put at risk and conditions for dementia sufferers worsened because of the government’s failure so far to test hundreds of thousands of staff and residents.\nThe programme was announced by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, two weeks ago but only tens of thousands of people have been tested.\nPublic Health England (PHE), the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) have repeatedly passed the buck about who should carry out the tests, according to correspondence with care homes seen by the Guardian.\nIn one email to a care manager sent on Thursday a CQC official admitted to “continued confusion” in the system.\nMatthew Nutt, managing director of Accurocare which runs homes in Oxford and Basingstoke, was told eight times by PHE that CQC was responsible for the programme and four times by CQC that it was PHE’s job.\n“The left hand doesn’t know what the right is doing,” he said.\nLast Thursday a DHSC official told him PHE was in charge and another said it was CQC. That contradicted what CQC told him 24 hours earlier: that its involvement in testing care staff ended on 25 April.\nHis organisation has been trying to obtain about 200 tests since 28 April, when Hancock announced that testing for all care workers and residents would be available regardless of whether they are showing symptoms of coronavirus. So far he has received none.\nOn Tuesday Hancock claimed “the performance on testing has been unbelievably positive”.\n“It has been a complete system failure,” said Nutt. “We don’t know when we are going to get test kits. The government’s plan to lift the lockdown says all homes will have testing by 6 June. It’s far too slow. How many more people have to die?”\nMore than 400,000 people live in care homes, looked after by a workforce of 1.5 million but the number of tests carried out so far remain in the tens of thousands, the government said on Monday.\nThe extension of testing beyond just people with symptoms was initially welcomed by care managers because it promises better infection control. Care home fatalities increased to almost 10,000 in the UK on Tuesday.\nWhen Nottingham Community Housing Association (NCHA) tried to get tests for its care home residents and staff, a PHE official said it didn’t know anything about testing residents, before pointing them to the CQC. PHE then changed its mind again saying it would send the tests, but when they failed to arrive, PHE reversed again saying CQC was responsible.\n“It is very frustrating because we can’t effectively manage the risk without knowing [who has the virus],” said Holly Dagnall, director of homes and wellbeing at NCHA.\nJohn Guy, chairman of the trustees of the Fairfield care home in Oxford, also said his facility had requested swabs for home testing four times since Hancock’s announcement but none had arrived. Previously his staff had been told to drive 60 miles to Twickenham to a testing centre.\nLabour’s shadow care minister, Liz Kendall, said the accounts revealed “total chaos” in the system.\n“Weeks into this epidemic ministers still haven’t got to grips with the basics of testing residents and staff,” she said. “Reports from the frontline show total chaos as national bodies squabble over who is responsible, leaving care home managers and staff struggling to cope. The government’s own ‘recovery strategy’ document says they won’t guarantee every care home will even be offered testing until 6 June. This is not good enough.”\nThe government has showed signs of shifting its strategy after originally saying CQC was “leading co-ordination of testing for the care sector”. On Thursday it gave local public health directors the role saying the system needed to be “more joined up”. In a letter, the care minister, Helen Whately, described it as “a significant change” and said that soon there would be capacity for 30,000 tests of care home residents and staff a day.\nHowever, even that appeared to be miscommunicated as some public health directors did not receive the letter until Sunday.\n“It has been totally shambolic,” said one director of public health. “The care minister’s letter has been interpreted as an admission of the failure of testing in care homes.”\nCQC said in a statement that it was only provided some administrative support for the DHSC, between 10 and 25 April, in contacting care homes and offering to order a testing kit for them and to enable providers to refer their staff for testing at DHSC testing sites.\nA DHSC spokesperson said: “The government is working around the clock to make sure care homes and our frontline care workforce are getting the support they need to protect residents and tackle coronavirus. We have launched a new online portal to make it easier for care homes to arrange deliveries of coronavirus test kits. All care home staff and residents can now be tested, whether they have symptoms or not.”\nThis article was amended on 13 May 2020. An earlier version included a statement from CQC that said in relation to contacting care homes and offering to order a testing kit for them, “after 25 April, DHSC, PHE and the NHS took on the role”. After publication, CQC clarified that it provided some administrative support for the DHSC’s testing process between 10 and 25 April.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the JSON format response based on the provided news article:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a system failure, but it is not related to a Navigation system failure.

{"num":45,"Time":"Sat 10 May 2014 22.53 CEST","Title":"NHS hit by new tech failure as it scraps patient booking system","Content":"The NHS is quietly ditching an electronic booking system for outpatient appointments, Choose and Book, which has cost £356m since 2004, in a further sign of the difficulties of introducing efficient IT systems into the health service.\nThe decision to replace it with a potentially even more expensive e-referral scheme by 2016 follows a drop in its use by doctors and patients.\nDuring a recent investigation into NHS waiting times by the House of Commons' public accounts committee, MPs were told by NHS staff that while some GPs liked Choose and Book, many did not, and that not all outpatient appointment slots were available on it, limiting its usefulness.\nNHS England said last night the new e-referral system would use different technology, but it was unable to say how much the scheme would cost.\nMeg Hillier, a Labour member of the committee, said: \"It's another NHS cock up. A system designed for use by GPs but only used by half of them … has been quietly dropped, so quietly that even most of the NHS seems unaware.\n\"In the middle of all of this are patients. Choose and Book was supposed to speed things up but the evidence we heard in committee showed this was not so in most cases.\"\nChoose and Book was introduced by the Labour government to enable patients needing an outpatient appointment to select, with their GP, a hospital appointment at a convenient date and time. The aim was to speed up the process and cut out the need for costly paperwork.\nThe Department of Health wants patients to become more involved in managing their appointments. The National Audit Office has estimated that 1.6m patients failed to turn up for first outpatient appointments in 2012-13, costing the taxpayer up to £225m.\nBut many patients and doctors found Choose and Book complicated and time-consuming. Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston said the system suited patients who were good with technology but not those who were less so. She said doctors often did not have time to log on to it during appointments with their patients.\nWollaston, a member of the Commons select committee on health, added that technology could have drawbacks.\n\"You do have to be careful that when setting up this kind of system using the latest techology, that you do not inadvertently end up widening health inequalities in the process.\"\nUna O'Brien, the permanent secretary at the Department of Health, said the replacement scheme would have additional features, and would be be available on mobile apps.\nShe told the Commons committee: \"We are aiming to have 100% electronic referrals within the next five years – sooner than that if we can make it. That will cut out a lot of these errors.\" The idea of making it compulsory for GPs to use the replacement system when it comes on stream, with an inbuilt incentive and penalty scheme for doctors and hospitals, is being considered.\nThe decision to drop Choose and Book, and admissions that it was not being used by many doctors and patients, marks the latest of many IT failures in the NHS, where attempts to embrace technology in the quest for more joined-up care have encountered numerous delays and cost overruns.\nA £12bn project launched in England in 2002 aimed to allow 50 million patients' records to be held electronically so that they could be accessed by staff in different parts of the service: primary care, hospitals, out of hours services and ambulance crews. But it was scrapped by the coalition after a series of setbacks.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure as it discusses the problems and failures related to an electronic booking system, Choose and Book, used in the healthcare sector.

{"num":44,"Time":"Updated 3:57 AM EDT, Sat May 6, 2023","Title":"Russia’s jamming of US-provided rocket systems complicates Ukraine’s war effort","Content":"Washington\nCNN\n — \nRussia has been thwarting US-made mobile rocket systems in Ukraine more frequently in recent months, using electronic jammers to throw off its GPS guided targeting system to cause rockets to miss their targets, multiple people briefed on the matter told CNN.\nUkrainian military officials, with the US’ help, have had to come up with a variety of different workarounds as it continues to use the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) which has been perhaps the most revered and feared piece of weaponry in Ukraine’s fight.\nThe medium-range rocket systems were hailed as a game changer in the conflict and have played a key role since the moment they arrived in Ukraine last summer, including in last year’s offensive that allowed Ukraine to take back significant swaths of territory from Russia.\nBut in recent months, the systems have been rendered increasingly less effective by the Russians’ intensive blocking, five US, British and Ukrainian sources tell CNN, forcing US and Ukrainian officials to find ways to tweak the HIMARS’ software to counter the evolving Russian jamming efforts.\nWhat we know about the murky drone attack on the Kremlin - and the questions that remain\n“It is a constant cat-and-mouse game” of finding a countermeasure to the jamming, a Pentagon official said, only to then have the Russians counteract that countermeasure. And it is not clear how sustainable that game is in the long term.\nWith a major Ukrainian counteroffensive expected to start very soon and Ukraine’s reliance on HIMARS, solutions are even more of a priority so that Ukrainian troops can make significant headway.\n“It’s one thing to be able to hold the Russians off where they are right now. It’s another thing to drive them out,” retired US Army Brig. Gen. Steven Anderson told CNN. “They’re dug in, they’ve been there for a year.”\nUkraine needs to keep ‘HIMARS in the game’\nHIMARS “have been extremely important,” he added. “They have to be able to keep those HIMARS in the game and keep using them to be able to make effective deep strikes.”\nUkraine has received 18 American HIMARS to date and the US has committed to sending 20 more. Other NATO allies have donated 10 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, according to the State Department.\nThe routine announcements from the Biden administration of hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid for Ukraine, including one on Wednesday, regularly include HIMARS munitions, called GMLRs, as a top item, though notably the exact number is not revealed.\nThe US has also helped the Ukrainians locate the Russian jammers and destroy them – a “high priority” effort, according to a secret Pentagon document that was part of a trove allegedly leaked by Airman Jack Teixeira.\nAnalysis: Cross-border attacks as Russia and Ukraine seek to weaken each other ahead of expected offensive\n“We will continue to advocate\/recommend that those jammers are disrupted\/destroyed,” the document says, “to the maximum extent possible.”\nGPS jamming can affect other “smart” US munitions like the precision-guided Excalibur artillery shells fired from Howitzers and air-dropped bombs called JDAMs. The leaked Pentagon document described the JDAMS as being particularly susceptible to the disruption.\nA US official confirmed that the US has been advising the Ukrainians on how to identify and destroy Russian jammers since there are a limited number of ways to modify HIMARS and their rockets.\nPentagon official downplays impact of jamming efforts\nA senior Pentagon official downplayed the impact of the interference, telling CNN that on Monday Ukrainian forces fired 18 rockets without issue, about the daily rate of the past few weeks. The official declined to comment on the broader impact of the jamming. HIMARS are manufactured by Lockheed Martin, which deferred questions on jamming to the US government.\nElectronic warfare is carried out by both sides, up and down the front line where there is heavy drone activity used for surveillance and in partnership with artillery targeting. The hardware can also be mounted on or around whatever might be targeted.\nDepending on the location and strength of the jamming, a rocket can still launch and result in a successful strike with significant damage. In addition to GPS guidance, the rockets have inertial navigation systems that are not susceptible and remain accurate, though not as precise as when guided by GPS coordinates.\nUkrainian president says he learned of Pentagon leak from news reports\nWidespread Russian jamming can have drawbacks for their own forces as well, impacting their ability to communicate and operate.\nBut even when they do function, the HIMARS have increasingly been missing targets, said one Ukrainian source briefed by drone operators on the frontlines.\nOne drone pilot on the Eastern front described the jamming of the mobile HIMARS as “significant,” according to the source, something he hadn’t seen in his area before last November, several months after the HIMARS first arrived in Ukraine at the beginning of the summer.\nAnother drone operator in the southern Kherson region claimed to the source that the effectiveness of HIMARS was down dramatically while cautioning that they’re still very necessary and relied on but no longer as dominant as they once were.\nFor nearly a year, the HIMARS system has been the longest-range rocket system Ukraine has, allowing troops to fire up to six rockets in quick succession at Russian positions as far as 50 miles away. With an accuracy of around 10 feet, the 200-pound warheads have taken out logistics hubs, ammunition depots, command posts and communication nodes, among other targets.\nThey were also instrumental in helping Ukraine retake significant amounts of territory in the south and northeast last fall, and as of February, Ukraine had expended approximately 9,500 HIMARS rockets, according to a daily update from the time reviewed by CNN.\n‘Constant tweaking’\nA US official familiar with the workarounds said they include updates to the software on both the targeting system software as well the rockets.\nThe senior Pentagon official described it as: “constant tweaking to get them to stay effective,” adding that updates had been made as recently as this week.\n“If their jamming gets more sophisticated, then your countermeasures have to get more sophisticated,” a British official agreed.\nRussia’s use of electronic warfare has not been nearly as widespread as expected when Russia first invaded but they have made use of it since the beginning of the war. It’s a routine part of modern warfare that can be cheap and easy to implement. It’s expected, so the focus is on ways to “dilute” the impact, the official said.\nBut with Russian units largely stalled on the Ukrainian frontlines and stuck in defensive positions, Russian forces have made increasing use of their jamming systems to counteract the HIMARS, sources said.\nAs Ukraine prepares counteroffensive, Russia appears in disarray\nA separate but related problem for Ukraine is that the Russians have been moving some of their equipment further back and out of reach of the HIMARS systems, which have a range of about 50 miles.\nWhile the rocket systems are capable of firing longer-range missiles called ATACMS – which can reach targets over 185 miles away – the US has resisted providing them to Ukraine both because the missiles are in limited supply and because the US is worried Russia would see them as too provocative.\nThe British official acknowledged that since HIMARS were first introduced, the requirements, the training and supplementary equipment has changed as Russia’s electronic interference has evolved.\n“Jamming is like the weather or the terrain, it’s something that happens that you have to deal with,” the official said. Still, he added, HIMARS remains a “highly useful piece of kit.”\nCNN’s Oren Liebermann contributed reporting.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure as it discusses Russia's jamming of US-provided rocket systems in Ukraine.

{"num":46,"Time":"Sat 23 Feb 2019 09.59 CET","Title":"The deadly truth about a world built for men – from stab vests to car crashes","Content":"W\nhen broadcaster Sandi Toksvig was studying anthropology at university, one of her female professors held up a photograph of an antler bone with 28 markings on it. “This,” said the professor, “is alleged to be man’s first attempt at a calendar.” Toksvig and her fellow students looked at the bone in admiration. “Tell me,” the professor continued, “what man needs to know when 28 days have passed? I suspect that this is woman’s first attempt at a calendar.”\nWomen have always tracked their periods. We’ve had to. Since 2015, I’ve been reliant on a period tracker app, which reassures me that there’s a reason I’m welling up just thinking about Andy Murray’s “casual feminism”. And then there’s the issue of the period itself: when you will be bleeding for up to seven days every month, it’s useful to know more or less when those seven days are going to take place. Every woman knows this, and Toksvig’s experience is a neat example of the difference a female perspective can make, even to issues that seem entirely unrelated to gender.\nFor most of human history, though, that perspective has not been recorded. Going back to the theory of Man the Hunter, the lives of men have been taken to represent those of humans overall. When it comes to the other half of humanity, there is often nothing but silence. And these silences are everywhere. Films, news, literature, science, city planning, economics, the stories we tell ourselves about our past, present and future, are all marked – disfigured – by a female-shaped “absent presence”. This is the gender data gap.\nThese silences, these gaps, have consequences. They impact on women’s lives, every day. The impact can be relatively minor – struggling to reach a top shelf set at a male height norm, for example. Irritating, certainly. But not life-threatening. Not like crashing in a car whose safety tests don’t account for women’s measurements. Not like dying from a stab wound because your police body armour doesn’t fit you properly. For these women, the consequences of living in a world built around male data can be deadly.\nThe gender data gap is both a cause and a consequence of the type of unthinking that conceives of humanity as almost exclusively male. In the 1956 musical My Fair Lady, phoneticist Henry Higgins is baffled when, after enduring months of his hectoring put-downs, his protege-cum-victim Eliza Doolittle finally bites back. “Why can’t a woman be more like a man?” he grumbles.\nWhen ‘women’s work’ is deadly\nThe formula to determine standard office temperature was developed in the 1960s around the metabolic resting rate of the average man. But a recent Dutch study found that the metabolic rate of young adult females performing light office work is significantly lower than the standard values for men doing the same activity. In fact, the formula may overestimate female metabolic rate by as much as 35%, meaning that current offices are on average five degrees too cold for women. This leads to the odd sight of female office workers wrapped in blankets in the summer, while their male colleagues wander around in shorts.\nNot only is this situation inequitable, it is bad business sense: an uncomfortable workforce is an unproductive workforce. But workplace data gaps lead to a lot worse than simple discomfort and inefficiency. Over the past 100 years, workplaces have, on the whole, got considerably safer. In the early 1900s, about 4,400 people in the UK died at work every year. By 2016, that figure had fallen to 135. But while serious injuries at work have been decreasing for men, there is evidence that they have been increasing among women. The gender data gap is again implicated, with occupational research traditionally focused on male-dominated industries.\nEvery year, 8,000 people in the UK die from work-related cancers. And although most research in this area has been done on men, it’s far from clear that men are the most affected. Over the past 50 years, breast cancer rates in the industrialised world have risen significantly – but a failure to research female bodies, occupations and environments means that the data for exactly what is behind this rise is lacking. “We know everything about dust disease in miners,” Rory O’Neill, professor of occupational and environmental policy research at the University of Stirling, tells me. “You can’t say the same for exposures, physical or chemical, in ‘women’s work’.”\nCancer is a long-latency disease, O’Neill says, so even if we started the studies now, it would take a working generation before we had any usable data. But we aren’t starting the studies now. Instead, we continue to rely on data from studies done on men as if they apply to women. Specifically, Caucasian men aged 25 to 30, who weigh 70kg. This is “Reference Man” and his superpower is being able to represent humanity as a whole. Of course, he does not.\nMen and women have different immune systems and hormones, which can play a role in how chemicals are absorbed. Women tend to be smaller than men and have thinner skin, both of which can lower the level of toxins they can be safely exposed to. This lower tolerance threshold is compounded by women’s higher percentage of body fat, in which some chemicals can accumulate. Chemicals are still usually tested in isolation, and on the basis of a single exposure. But this is not how women tend to encounter them.\nIn nail salons, where the workforce is almost exclusively female (and often migrant), workers will be exposed on a daily basis to a huge range of chemicals that are “routinely found in the polishes, removers, gels, shellacs, disinfectants and adhesives that are staples of their work”, according to the Canadian researcher Anne Rochon Ford. Many of these chemicals have been linked to cancer, miscarriages and lung diseases. Some may alter the body’s normal hormonal functions. If these women then go home and begin a second unpaid shift cleaning their home, they will be exposed to different chemicals that are ubiquitous in common products. The effects of these mixing together are largely unknown.\n‘Serious injuries at work are increasing among women.’ Model: Nina Trickey. Hair and makeup: Vale Von Der Wehl using Laura Mercier and Kerastase. Assistant: Bruce Horak. Dummies: courtesy of Cellbond. Photograph: Kellie French\/The Guardian\nMost of the research on chemicals has focused on their absorption through the skin. But many of the ones used in nail salons are extremely volatile, which means that they evaporate at room temperature and can be inhaled – along with the considerable amounts of dust produced when acrylic nails are filed. The research on how this may impact on workers is virtually nonexistent.\nPart of the failure to see the risks in traditionally female-dominated industries is because often these jobs are an extension of what women do in the home (although at a more onerous scale). But the data gap when it comes to women in the workplace doesn’t only arise in female-dominated industries.\nLittle data exists on injuries to women in construction, but the New York Committee for Occupational Safety & Health (NYCOSH) points to a US study of union carpenters that found women had higher rates of sprains, strains and nerve conditions of the wrist and forearm than men. Given the lack of data, it’s hard to be sure exactly why this is, but it’s a safe bet to attribute at least some of the blame to “standard” construction site equipment being designed around the male body.\nA female police officer had to have breast-reduction surgery because of the health effects of wearing her body armour\nWendy Davis, ex-director of the Women’s Design Service in the UK, questions the standard size of a bag of cement. It’s a comfortable weight for a man to lift – but it doesn’t actually have to be that size, she points out. “If they were a bit smaller, then women could lift them.” Davis also takes issue with the standard brick size. “I’ve got photographs of my [adult] daughter holding a brick. She can’t get her hand round it. But [her husband] Danny’s hand fits perfectly comfortably. Why does a brick have to be that size?” She also notes that the typical A1 architect’s portfolio fits nicely under most men’s arms while most women’s arms don’t reach round it.\nNYCOSH similarly notes that “standard hand tools like wrenches tend to be too large for women’s hands to grip tightly”.\nIn the UK, employers are legally required to provide well-maintained personal protective equipment (PPE) – anything from goggles to full body suits – to workers who need it, free of charge. But most PPE is based on the sizes and characteristics of male populations from Europe and the US. The TUC found that employers often think that when it comes to female workers all they need to do to comply with this legal requirement is to buy smaller sizes.\nDifferences in chests, hips and thighs can affect the way the straps fit on safety harnesses. The use of a “standard” US male face shape for dust, hazard and eye masks means they don’t fit most women (as well as a lot of black and minority ethnic men). A 2017 TUC report found that the problem with ill-fitting PPE was worst in the emergency services, where only 5% of women said that their PPE never hampered their work, with body armour, stab vests, hi-vis vests and jackets all highlighted as unsuitable.\nWhen it comes to frontline workers, poorly fitting PPE can prove fatal. In 1997, a British female police officer was stabbed and killed while using a hydraulic ram to enter a flat. She had removed her body armour because it was too difficult to use the ram while wearing it. Two years later, a female police officer revealed that she had had to have breast-reduction surgery because of the health effects of wearing her body armour. After this case was reported, another 700 officers in the same force came forward to complain about the standard-issue protective vest.\nBut although the complaints have been coming regularly over the past 20 years, little seems to have been done. British female police officers report being bruised by their kit belts; a number have had to have physiotherapy because of the way stab vests sit on their body; many complain there is no space for their breasts. This is not only uncomfortable, it also results in stab vests coming up too short, leaving women unprotected.\nThe tyranny of the toilet queue\nIn April 2017, the BBC journalist Samira Ahmed wanted to use a toilet. She was at a screening of the James Baldwin documentary I Am Not Your Negro at London’s Barbican arts centre, and it was the interval. Any woman who has ever been to the theatre knows what that means. This evening, the queue was worse than usual. Far worse. Because in an almost comically blatant display of not having thought about women at all, the Barbican had turned both the male and female toilets gender neutral simply by replacing the “men” and “women” signage with “gender neutral with urinals” and “gender neutral with cubicles”. The obvious happened. Only men were using the supposedly “gender neutral with urinals” and everyone was using the “gender neutral with cubicles”.\nRather than rendering the toilets genuinely gender neutral, they had simply increased the provision for men. “Ah the irony of having to explain discrimination having just been to see I Am Not Your Negro IN YOUR CINEMA”, Ahmed tweeted, suggesting that turning the gents gender neutral would be sufficient: “There’s NEVER such a queue there & you know it.”\nOn the face of it, it may seem fair and equitable to accord male and female public toilets the same amount of space – and historically, this is the way it has been done: 50\/50 division of floor space has even been formalised in plumbing codes. However, if a male toilet has both cubicles and urinals, the number of people who can relieve themselves at once is far higher per square foot of floor space in the male bathroom than in the female bathroom. Suddenly equal floor space isn’t so equal.\nBut even if male and female toilets had an equal number of stalls, the issue wouldn’t be resolved, because women take up to 2.3 times as long as men to use the toilet. Women make up the majority of the elderly and disabled, two groups that will tend to need more time in the toilet. Women are also more likely to be accompanied by children, as well as disabled and older people. Then there’s the 20–25% of women of childbearing age who may be on their period at any one time, and therefore need to change a tampon or a sanitary pad.\nWomen may also require more trips to the bathroom: pregnancy significantly reduces bladder capacity, and women are eight times more likely to suffer from urinary-tract infections. In the face of all these anatomical differences, it would surely take a formal equality dogmatist to continue to argue that equal floor space between men and women is fair.\nThe gadgets built for one-size-fits-men\nIn 1998, a pianist called Christopher Donison wrote that “one can divide the world into roughly two constituencies”: those with larger hands, and those with smaller hands. Donison was writing as a male pianist who, due to his smaller than average hands, had struggled for years with traditional keyboards, but he could equally have been writing as a woman. There is plenty of data showing that women have, on average, smaller hands, and yet we continue to design equipment around the average male hand as if one-size-fits-men is the same as one-size-fits-all.\nThe average smartphone size is now 5.5 inches. While the average man can fairly comfortably use his device one-handed, the average woman’s hand is not much bigger than the handset itself. This is obviously annoying – and foolish for a company like Apple, given that research shows women are more likely to own an iPhone than men.\nOne woman found her car's voice-command system only listened to her husband, even though he was in the passenger seat\nThe tech journalist and author James Ball has a theory for why the big-screen fixation persists: because the received wisdom is that men drive high-end smartphone purchases. But if women aren’t driving high-end smartphone purchases – at least for non-Apple products – is it because women aren’t interested in smartphones? Or could it be because smartphones are designed without women in mind? On the bright side, Ball reassured me that screens probably wouldn’t be getting any bigger because “they’ve hit the limit of men’s hand size”.\nGood news for men, then. But tough breaks for women like my friend Liz who owns a third-generation Motorola Moto G. In response to one of my regular rants about handset sizes she replied that she’d just been “complaining to a friend about how difficult it was to zoom on my phone camera. He said it was easy on his. Turns out we have the same phone. I wondered if it was a hand-size thing.”\nWhen Zeynep Tufekci, a researcher at the University of North Carolina, was trying to document tear gas use in the Gezi Park protests in Turkey in 2013, the size of her Google Nexus got in the way. It was the evening of 9 June. Gezi Park was crowded. Parents were there with their children. And then the canisters were fired. Because officials “often claimed that tear gas was used only on vandals and violent protesters”, Tufekci wanted to document what was happening. So she pulled out her phone. “And as my lungs, eyes and nose burned with the pain of the lachrymatory agent released from multiple capsules that had fallen around me, I started cursing.” Her phone was too big. She could not take a picture one-handed – “something I had seen countless men with larger hands do all the time”. All Tufekci’s photos from the event were unusable, she wrote, and “for one simple reason: good smartphones are designed for male hands”.\nVoice recognition could be one solution to a smartphone that doesn’t fit your hands, but voice-recognition software is often hopelessly male-biased. In 2016, Rachael Tatman, a research fellow in linguistics at the University of Washington, found that Google’s speech-recognition software was 70% more likely to accurately recognise male speech.\nClearly, it is unfair for women to pay the same price as men for products that deliver an inferior service. But there can also be serious safety implications. Voice-recognition software in cars, for example, is meant to decrease distractions and make driving safer. But they can have the opposite effect if they don’t work. An article on car website Autoblog quoted a woman who had bought a 2012 Ford Focus, only to find that its voice-command system only listened to her husband, even though he was in the passenger seat. Another woman called the manufacturer for help when her Buick’s voice-activated phone system wouldn’t listen to her: “The guy told me point-blank it wasn’t ever going to work for me. They told me to get a man to set it up.”\nImmediately after writing this, I was with my mother in her Volvo Cross Country watching her try and fail to get the voice-recognition system to call her sister. After five failed attempts I suggested she tried lowering the pitch of her voice. It worked first time.\nIn the tech world, the implicit assumption that men are the default human remains king. When Apple launched its health-monitoring system with much fanfare in 2014, it boasted a “comprehensive” health tracker. It could track blood pressure; steps taken; blood alcohol level; even molybdenum and copper intake. But as many women pointed out at the time, they forgot one crucial detail: a period tracker.\nWhen Apple launched their AI, Siri, users in the US found that she (ironically) could find prostitutes and Viagra suppliers, but not abortion providers. Siri could help you if you’d had a heart attack, but if you told her you’d been raped, she replied “I don’t know what you mean by ‘I was raped.’”\nFrom smartwatches that are too big for women’s wrists, to map apps that fail to account for women who may want to know the “safest” in addition to “fastest” routes; to “measure how good you are at sex” apps called “iThrust” and “iBang” the tech industry is rife with other examples. While there are an increasing number of female-led tech firms that do cater to women’s needs, they are seen as a “niche” concern and often struggle to get funding.\nOne study of 12 of the most common fitness monitors found that they underestimated steps during housework by up to 74% (that was the Omron, which was within 1% for normal walking or running) and underestimated calories burned during housework by as much as 34%. Meanwhile, Fitbit users have complained that the device fails to account for movement while doing the extremely common female activity of pushing a pram (and, yes, men push prams, too; but not as often as the women who do 75% of the world’s unpaid care).\nHow women are put at risk on the roads\nMen are more likely than women to be involved in a car crash, which means they dominate the numbers of those seriously injured in them. But when a woman is involved in a car crash, she is 47% more likely to be seriously injured, and 71% more likely to be moderately injured, even when researchers control for factors such as height, weight, seatbelt usage, and crash intensity. She is also 17% more likely to die. And it’s all to do with how the car is designed – and for whom.\nWomen tend to sit further forward when driving. This is because we are on average shorter. Our legs need to be closer to reach the pedals, and we need to sit more upright to see clearly over the dashboard. This is not, however, the “standard seating position”, researchers have noted. Women are “out of position” drivers. And our wilful deviation from the norm means that we are at greater risk of internal injury on frontal collisions. The angle of our knees and hips as our shorter legs reach for the pedals also makes our legs more vulnerable. Essentially, we’re doing it all wrong.\nCars have been designed using car crash-test dummies based on the 'average' male\nWomen are also at higher risk in rear-end collisions. We have less muscle on our necks and upper torso, which make us more vulnerable to whiplash (by up to three times), and car design has amplified this vulnerability. Swedish research has shown that modern seats are too firm to protect women against whiplash injuries: the seats throw women forward faster than men because the back of the seat doesn’t give way for women’s on average lighter bodies. The reason this has been allowed to happen is very simple: cars have been designed using car crash-test dummies based on the “average” male.\nCrash-test dummies were first introduced in the 1950s, and for decades they were based around the 50th-percentile male. The most commonly used dummy is 1.77m tall and weighs 76kg (significantly taller and heavier than an average woman); the dummy also has male muscle-mass proportions and a male spinal column. In the early 1980s, researchers based at Michigan University argued for the inclusion of a 50th-percentile female in regulatory tests, but this advice was ignored by manufacturers and regulators. It wasn’t until 2011 that the US started using a female crash-test dummy – although, as we’ll see, just how “female” these dummies are is questionable.\nIn 2018, Astrid Linder, research director of traffic safety at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute, presented a paper at the Road Safety on Five Continents Conference in South Korea, in which she ran through EU regulatory crash-test requirements. In no test is an anthropometrically correct female crash-test dummy required. The seatbelt test, one of the frontal-collision tests, and both lateral-collision tests all specify that a 50th-percentile male dummy should be used. There is one EU regulatory test that requires what is called a 5th-percentile female dummy, which is meant to represent the female population. Only 5% of women will be shorter than this dummy. But there are a number of data gaps. For a start, this dummy is only tested in the passenger seat, so we have no data at all for how a female driver would be affected – something of an issue you would think, given women’s “out of position” driving style. And secondly, this female dummy is not really female. It is just a scaled-down male dummy.\nConsumer tests can be slightly more stringent than regulatory ones. The 2011 introduction of female crash-test dummies in the US sent cars’ star ratings plummeting. When I spoke to EuroNCAP, a European organisation that provides car safety ratings for consumers, they said that since 2015 they have used male and female dummies in both front-crash tests, and that they base their female dummies on female anthropometric data – with the caveat that this is “where data is available”. EuroNCAP acknowledged that “sometimes” they do just use scaled-down male dummies. But women are not scaled-down men. We have different muscle mass distribution. We have lower bone density. There are differences in vertebrae spacing. Even our body sway is different. And these differences are all crucial when it comes to injury rates in car crashes.\nThe situation is even worse for pregnant women. Although a pregnant crash-test dummy was created back in 1996, testing with it is still not government-mandated either in the US or in the EU. In fact, even though car crashes are the No 1 cause of foetal death related to maternal trauma, we haven’t yet developed a seatbelt that works for pregnant women. Research from 2004 suggests that pregnant women should use the standard seatbelt; but 62% of third-trimester pregnant women don’t fit that design.\nLinder has been working on what she says will be the first crash-test dummy to accurately represent female bodies. Currently, it’s just a prototype, but she is calling on the EU to make testing on such dummies a legal requirement. In fact, Linder argues that this already is a legal requirement, technically speaking. Article 8 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union reads, “In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women.” Clearly, women being 47% more likely to be seriously injured in a car crash is one hell of an inequality to overlook.\nDesigners may believe they are making products for everyone, but in reality they are mainly making them for men. It’s time to start designing women in.\nThis is an edited extract from Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez (Chatto & Windus, £16.99).

Runways were closed for a period at Heathrow, Europe’s busiest airport, and Gatwick.\nFlights which did land at London’s airports were unable to unload passengers with gates gridlocked. Others were taking off up to four hours late.\nFlights started to depart again after 4.15pm, but passengers travelling to and from London’s largest airports faced lengthy delays and cancellations.\nA Heathrow spokesman said on Friday there had been 70 cancellations out of about 1,300 scheduled flights.\nAirports as far north as Aberdeen and Edinburgh were affected by the computer problem. Other airports that reported delays on Friday afternoon included Manchester, Stansted and Luton.\nBudget flier easyJet said on Friday night: “EasyJet has had to cancel 10 flights to and from London Gatwick, however all aircraft which were earlier diverted have all now continued to their original destinations. In addition, it is likely that other flights to and from the south of the UK will suffer delays this evening.”\nThe airline said it had cancelled two Gatwick-bound flights scheduled for Saturday.\nA message from Gatwick airport said on Friday evening: “Some cancellations should be expected and passengers are advised to contact their airline for the latest flight information.\n“All departing flights were affected for a period but the situation is improving and we [are] hoping to restore a near normal service later this evening.”\nIn a statement on its website on Friday evening, British Airways said: “While the system is slowly recovering, we anticipate the knock-on effects to take some time to resolve. Additional staff have been brought in to assist our customers and we have booked a large number of hotel rooms to accommodate those who have been disrupted.”\nAmong the passengers waiting for information on outgoing flights at Heathrow on Friday was Claire Baron, a young South African, who needed to get to Zurich on Friday night in order to catch a long haul connection to Johannesburg.\n“When you get to the front [of the queue] they’re saying that it takes 10 minutes to process and all they will do is give you a letter and a phone number,” she said, referring to long queues at Swiss Airlines. “‘They’re doing the best they can but I’m being fobbed off, [they’re] saying go home or get a hotel.”\nTwo Argentinian teenagers trying to get to Zurich for a connecting transatlantic flight had better luck. “We’re good at arguing. It’s in our culture,” said one, who added they had been rebooked on an early Saturday morning flight after lobbying officials and telling themthey did not want to queue for two hours. “I said that there was a special circumstance. My dog had to be put down today so I was in a really bad mood anyway.”\nAir traffic controller Nats was able to restore its computer services after the unknown glitch but hundreds of international flights had already been diverted or disrupted.\nAn image from the flightradar24.com website showing the airspace above London on Friday. Photograph: flightradar24.com\nTransport secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “Disruption on this scale is simply unacceptable and I have asked Nats for a full explanation of this evening’s incident.”\nA spokeswoman for Nats confirmed there was a technical failure at Swanwick, in Hampshire, the leading control centre for southern UK airspace.\nShe said: “The system has been restored. However, it will take time for operations across the UK to fully recover so passengers should contact their airline for the status of their flight.\n“We apologise for any delays and the inconvenience this may have caused. We are investigating the cause of this fault but can confirm that, contrary to some reports, it was not due to a power outage.”\nExperts said that a failure in some of the new upgraded software may have introduced a glitch. Doug Maclean, a consultant at DKM aviation, said: “The way the airspace is sectorised is designed to cope with this, so that if you have a glitch in one operations room, the whole of the UK is not affected.\n“It sounds very much that it was the upper airspace sector which was affected, which means the contingency is that the London terminal area which handles the lower airspace would have taken over some of the flights.”\nA computer problem affected operations at Swanwick for almost 12 hours last December, leaving thousands of passengers stranded as hundreds of flights were grounded.\nMaclean said flights could normally still continue to a limited extent. “Because of the sheer volume of traffic, the first way that we deal with it is flow control. They simply stop all the traffic heading for airspace. If a plane’s on the ground it’s not a risk. But at its most basic, controllers can still talk to the planes because they’ve got radio systems.”\nProf Martyn Thomas, visiting professor of software engineering at Oxford University, said: “NATS has an outstanding safety record. They won’t have compromised safety, which always takes priority over delays, but delays were inevitable once the controllers lost the support of their computer-based tools, because without the tools the controllers cannot handle as many simultaneous aircraft.”\nAviation expert David Learmount told the BBC: “Because they don’t take any risks at air traffic control, they like to empty the skies. But because they have landed some planes, it shows they still have some capability.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it discusses a computer failure that caused disruptions at UK airports, including London's busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick.

Capita is one of the government’s biggest suppliers, with £6.5bn of public sector contracts spanning London’s congestion charge system to recruiting soldiers for the army.\nA spokesperson for the company, who was unable to access their own email, said: “We are aware of a technical issue with our systems, which we are investigating.”\nIn a later statement, issued on Friday evening, a Capita spokesperson said: “We would like to reassure any customers whose services have been affected that we are making good progress and working closely with our technical partners to swiftly resolve the issues.”\nCapita’s customers include the London boroughs of Barnet, and Barking and Dagenham, and South Oxfordshire. Their websites displayed messages on Friday saying that phone lines for their benefits, council tax and business rates call centres were down.\nCapita also has its own cybersecurity division, and claims to block 1m spam emails a year from entering school networks.\nA source familiar with the outage said the National Cyber Security Centre, the Cabinet Office and other government agencies had been alerted to the incident, given the group’s role in sensitive areas such as Royal Navy training centres and security at Ministry of Defence bases.\nPeople at sites including critical national infrastructure have resorted to using radios, pens and paper, the source said.\nSome employees still have access to computers and email, and the company said its investigation was in the early stages and that it was too soon to tell if the failure was caused by a cyber-attack.\nCapita was still unsure if hackers were behind the outage on Friday afternoon but there is no evidence of a data breach as yet, according to a source close to the company. The problem is chiefly affecting the Office365 program suite, which includes email, Teams virtual meetings and Word and Excel but clients’ systems appear to be unaffected.\nAccording to sources at Capita, company systems went down at 4am but many staff were not aware until they tried to log on at 7am. Employees received a text from the company at 8.45am explaining that there was a company-wide problem.\nOne staff member, who asked not to be named, said they were unable to log into their laptop, with their usual password rejected as “incorrect”. They said employees could not access Capita’s systems or any other computer programmes.\nStaff were told by text: “We are urgently investigating this and will provide you with an update shortly. Please do not attempt to access via VPN or submit password recovery requests.”\nThe outage, first reported by the Times, triggered concern within the UK government because Capita, which employs more than 50,000 people in the UK, is one of the government’s most important suppliers.\nIts public service division, whose main customer is the British government, reported revenues of £1.4bn last year, consolidating its position as a key supplier at the heart of the government’s efforts to improve digital services.\nIts largest government customer is the Department for Work and Pensions, which has farmed out £2bn of work to Capita, mostly on its disability payment assessment services. The company has £1.9bn of contracts with the Ministry of Defence, including recruitment for the British army, maintenance at the UK’s Submarine Training Centre, and fire and rescue operations for the Ministry of Defence.\nCapita also provides primary care support services for the NHS, electronic tagging for the prisons and probation service, and operates Transport for London’s road-charging system, covering the congestion charge and ultra-low emissions zone. It holds a contract with HM Revenue and Customs to automate some of the tax collection authority’s processes and has a £456m contract with the BBC to collect the licence fee.\nSign up to Business Today\nFree daily newsletter\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

{"num":38,"Time":null,"Title":"In 2005, Helios flight 522 crashed into a Greek hillside. Was it because one man forgot to flip a switch?","Content":"E\narly on the morning of 14 August 2005, Alan Irwin, then 44, was with his partner, Donna, and their two young children in an apartment in Larnaca, Cyprus. It was a convenient base, only minutes from the airport. Irwin was an aircraft engineer; he had become obsessed with the technical aspects of planes as a young man in the Royal Air Force, following in the footsteps of his father, also an aircraft engineer and pilot. “I enjoy being around machines,” Irwin says. “If they’re broken, they’re broken. You can’t get angry at them. People can be quite frustrating.”\nIrwin went on to work for airlines such as McAlpine Aviation and Monarch, and by 2005 had been a freelance licensed engineer for 15 years. The work suited him: it was well paid, and he liked to travel. He had worked in Kuwait, China, Malaysia, the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, Miami.\nThat April, Helios Airways, the low-cost Cypriot airline, hired Irwin for six months. He was a familiar face, having worked there in 2002. Small and trim, with wavy hair, he had an affable, hands-on manner his managers liked. Helios was based at Larnaca airport and had three aircraft – all Boeing 737s. Irwin’s job was to do the “turnarounds”: checking the plane over after it arrived and ensuring it was safe to take off again. On some days he was needed for only a few hours. “The work was interesting and the quality of life fabulous,” he says, from the home he designed and built himself in Bedfordshire. A pool table stands in the open-plan living room. “My lad used to stand on a plastic box the size of a top hat to take his pool shot,” he remembers. His son is now six foot five.\nThat day, Irwin had started work at 1am, finished at around 6.30am and was planning to take his children to the beach. It was the school holidays and his family were over from Bedfordshire, where they lived during term time. At 8am, the phone rang. It was the operations centre at Helios asking Irwin to go into the office. He didn’t think much of it. “Sometimes the engineering manager just wanted to chat about the flying programme or shift patterns,” he says.\nBut Irwin found the operations room in crisis. They had lost radio contact with one of their planes. Flight 522 had taken off from Larnaca for Athens at 6.07am. The flight time was one hour and 45 minutes. It was now more than two hours since takeoff and the plane was still in the air, with 121 people on board. The office had received a chilling report from two jets scrambled by the Hellenic air force to intercept the plane: the captain’s seat was empty; the person in the first officer’s seat was slumped over the controls; the only three passengers visible were motionless, wearing oxygen masks; and masks were dangling from overhead units. “Everyone was thinking terrorism,” Irwin says.\nHis response was measured. “Engineers aren’t particularly reactive people. I don’t panic. I just take the information and work through it.” The plane, now on autopilot, was circling over Athens, as if waiting for permission to land. Irwin calculated that it had taken off with enough fuel to be in the air for around three hours. In another 20 minutes, flight 522 would crash. As the news of the impending disaster spread, the operations room filled up. “It was decided I couldn’t be of any use,” Irwin says. “They said, ‘Go home. We’ll phone if we need you.’”\nAt 9.03am, flight 522 crashed into a hillside near the village of Grammatiko, 25 miles from Athens, killing everyone on board. There were 115 passengers, from Greece, Cyprus and Australia, and six crew. A fireball destroyed several acres of scrub and pasture land.\nT\nhere is a ritual to aviation disasters. When a plane crashes, each twisted and charred fragment is painstakingly located, mapped and tagged, with findings submitted to investigating boards who probe and question, and draw conclusions. It is based on the principle that what we learn from one accident can help prevent another. But the rituals of disaster also involve a blame game, with a tendency to point to human error.\nThis has played out in the recent catastrophic crashes of two Boeing 737 Maxs. In the immediate wake of these crashes, involving newer planes, Boeing suggested the blame lay with the pilots. “Procedures were not completely followed,” said Boeing’s then CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, at a news conference in April 2019. A month later, Boeing admitted it had known about a software problem with its 737 Max planes a year before the fatal accidents – though it insisted that there were plans to address it. This week, however, a damning report by US politicians found that a “broken safety culture” at Boeing had contributed to both crashes.\nEarlier this month, a Boeing spokesperson told the Guardian that, since the 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, the company had developed a software update “expected to reduce the crew’s workload in non-normal flight situations and prevent erroneous data” from being shared. “Boeing is working closely with the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and other international regulators to meet their expectations as we work to safely return the 737 Max to service.”\nThe tail fin of the Boeing 737 – the most intact part of the plane – at the crash site near Athens. Most victims were found still strapped into their seats. Photograph: EPA\nAfter the Helios crash, attention focused on a number of employees, including the airline’s chief pilot, Ianko Stoimenov, who was in charge of training and supervising pilots; and the captain, Hans-Jürgen Merten, who died in the crash. Of Merten, the accident report said: “His East German heritage meant he was likely a man of few words who was not very comfortable around people.” But a large portion of the blame was attributed to Alan Irwin. For him, it was the start of an eight-year legal battle. It destroyed his 20-year relationship with his partner; he lost his job and his equilibrium.\nAfter the disaster, Greek air investigators determined that flight 522 had crashed because it had failed to pressurise properly. As it climbed, the air in the cabin had become too thin to breathe, causing most people to lose consciousness. The investigation quickly focused on the theory that the pressurisation selector switch had been left in “manual” rather than “auto”, and attributed this to human error – principally that of Irwin who, they said, had not returned the switch to its correct position after a safety check; and of incompetent pilots who had failed to spot the error.\nThis narrative was soon leaked to the press. “Alan Irwin… is at the centre of the inquiry after reports that a knob used to control cabin pressure was left in the wrong position after a safety check,” stated the Times.\nMeanwhile, Boeing was also attributing the crash to human error. “Helios’s ground engineers did not follow Boeing’s correct procedure,” said Stephen Preston, a lawyer hired by the manufacturer, in a private deposition to the Greek courts seen by the Guardian. “At least 16 separate mistakes were made by the ground staff, the flight deck crew and the passenger cabin crew. If any one of these mistakes had not been made, the accident would not have happened.”\nBut the causes of the crash were more complicated. Since 1994, there had been a history of incidents involving a confusing alert system on Boeing 737s. A warning horn on the plane would sound for two very different reasons: problems with the takeoff configuration (incorrect positioning of wing flaps, for example) or as an altitude warning – a loss of pressure that leads to less oxygen on the plane. Boeing had been alerted to this as a safety concern – most recently by the director of Nasa’s Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), the year before the crash.\nFor Irwin, this design flaw was crucial. “The crew have to take some responsibility, because at the end of the day they are in command of the airplane,” he says. “But if Boeing had listened to previous concerns, the crash wouldn’t have happened.”\nW\nhat did, and didn’t happen, in the early hours of 14 August 2005? At 1.25am, flight 522 arrived at Larnaca airport from Heathrow. As Irwin walked out to the plane, the pilot told him about a tech log entry: noisy door. Cabin crew had heard a banging sound coming from the door used for loading catering supplies. “No problem, I’ll look at it,” Irwin said.\nThat day Irwin was working with Malcolm Fowler, then 39, a British engineer on a six-week contract with Helios. Irwin decided to carry out a cabin pressurisation leak check, to test the integrity of the door.\nHe switched the pressurisation selector switch to manual. This closes the outflow valve and means air inside the cabin cannot escape. (When the switch is in auto, a computer calibrates the pressure inside the plane automatically.) He told Fowler to sit by the problem door. They waited for a few minutes, but heard nothing. Irwin depressurised the plane, returning the switch, he stresses, to auto.\nAn arrival monitor in Prague, flight 522’s final destination, shows it as cancelled. Photograph: Reuters\nThe flight took off. At 6.12am and at an altitude of 12,040ft, and climbing, the warning horn sounded. At 6.14am, the captain contacted the operations centre at Helios. Irwin was still on the airfield; he would always stay for 30 minutes after takeoff to make sure a plane got clear. He spoke to the captain. “He said, ‘My cooling light is off.’ There are two equipment cooling fans; if they fail, they bring the light on. So I said, ‘Well, they’re meant to be.’” In the accident investigation report, Irwin is recorded as asking the captain to confirm that the pressurisation panel was selected to auto. The captain replied, “Where are my equipment cooling circuit breakers?” Irwin told him they were behind his seat, and the call ended at 6.20am. Irwin went home.\nBased on the flight data, the accident investigation report later concluded that the crew had “reacted to the warning horn as if it had been a takeoff configuration warning. Had the flight crew realised the significance, they should have immediately donned their oxygen masks.”\nWhen Irwin watched the aftermath of the crash on TV a few hours later, he was stunned. “I felt numb because of all the people on board and the crew, who were friends – I’d known them for years,” he says. When the plane came down, it was travelling at an estimated speed of 400mph. The force of the impact was enormous, spreading chunks of metal and other fragments over two rocky hills. Most victims were found still strapped into their seats. The galley carts were stowed, suggesting the cabin crew had not yet begun to serve food or drinks. The most intact part of the plane was the tail section. Radiant among the burnt scrub and twisted metal was a giant portrait of the Greek sun god: the crest created in Helios’s glory days.\nT\nhree hours after flight 522 went down, a senior Helios executive put in a call to Kenyon International Emergency Services, based in Bracknell, Berkshire. Catastrophes are Kenyon’s business. The company is on a retainer with many of the world’s airlines, national governments and rail companies to provide practical help after a crisis: it leads efforts to recover and repatriate human remains, return possessions and help bereaved friends and relatives.\nAt 1.30pm, a briefing was held at Kenyon’s crisis management centre, where a rapid response team had been assembled. Some members flew to the crash site; others identified hotels in Cyprus and Greece where the bereaved could gather to receive information and support.\nKenyon’s co-owner and CEO, Robert Jensen, has learned many lessons in his 20 years with the company. One is that the airline should send a condolence letter to the bereaved: “It is a formal acknowledgment – of the loss, that life is changed and will for some time be very hard. And that the company involved, though perhaps not responsible, has a human face.”\nBut in the case of flight 522, families did not receive a letter.\nThe first officer’s wife at his funeral three days after the crash.

Nobody wanted to say sorry because that could be admitting fault. Robert [Jensen] and I stayed up one night until two o’clock drafting the condolence letter, getting the wording right. We gave it to the board at Helios, but nobody would sign it. Ultimately no letter was sent.”\nGates notes that the antipathy “ramped up” every day; staff received threats, intimidation and abuse. The crash had been the deadliest in Greek history. Several children had been on board. “It reinforced the idea: this is a bad company, they don’t care, so they should be accountable,” Jensen says.\nThe crash was now an international news story. It was a “ghost plane”, a “flying tomb”, with people passed out in their seats for more than two hours. The forensic report concluded that victims had been alive on impact, though in a “deep, non-reversible coma”. There was a hero and a mystery: in the last 30 minutes (all that was documented on the cockpit recorder), a cabin attendant had used the emergency code to open the locked cockpit door, sat in the captain’s seat and tried, too late, to take control of the plane. As the engines flamed out and the aircraft started its rapid descent, he made an attempt to level it, alleviating the impact. How had he remained conscious? Why had he not entered the cockpit sooner?\nThe Greek-led accident investigation got under way. According to Gates, “The regulations are absolutely clear – the job is to find the causes and not to assign blame. But straight away,” he alleges, “there was a blame mentality. And, ultimately, Alan got caught up in that.”\nW\nhen Irwin arrived at the police station in Larnaca, four days after the accident, he presumed it was for a casual chat – that the police might need technical assistance. Quickly, however, the atmosphere changed. “It started to get a bit heated. I thought it might be a good time to have a solicitor, just in case. The police refused. They said, ‘You’re not under caution – you are only assisting with an inquiry.’\n“Right at the end, one of the officers said, ‘I put it to you that you left the switch in manual and you caused the accident.’ The other officer said, ‘You don’t have to answer that question, but it will be on your statement.’ So I said, ‘No comment.’” After that, they drew the 12-hour interview to a close.\nAt that point, Irwin still didn’t anticipate that he would be charged: “There was nothing criminal to answer for, I’d done my job.” On 29 August, he flew back to the UK, at Helios’s suggestion. But his name and address were published in the British newspapers. A photographer followed Irwin and Donna as they drove through their village. “He went the wrong way round a roundabout, leaning across, trying to get a photograph. That distressed Donna.”\nIrwin had a job lined up at easyJet. But when managers realised he was implicated in the Helios crash, they withdrew the offer. It was only after engineers who knew Irwin spoke up for him that he was taken on. Life resumed, with Irwin still regarding the Greek accident investigation as misguided. “I still had faith in the system,” he says.\nThe linchpin of the case against Irwin was that, when investigators found the pressurisation mode switch at the crash site, it was in manual. Irwin had already acknowledged that he had turned the switch to manual to do the pressurisation test. This, the investigators alleged, proved that the switch had remained in this position throughout the flight.\nExcept that it was not left in manual, says Irwin, who argues that investigators had not accounted for the distorting effects of impact. He points out that the stem of the switch had been forcibly bent several degrees past manual. There were also deep gouge marks on the faceplate of the switch, suggesting trauma from the crash.\nThe switch was shipped for analysis to Boeing’s laboratory in Seattle. It was Boeing, under the supervision of an accident investigator, that concluded that the switch was in manual on impact. This finding formed the basis of the accident investigation report, published in 2006, which concluded that the crash had three direct causes: the switch being in manual; the failure to identify the cabin warning; and the crew being incapacitated by hypoxia, or lack of oxygen. (Boeing did not escape censure: the report also recorded “ineffectiveness of measures taken by the manufacturer in response to previous pressurization incidents” as a “latent” cause.)\nThe report’s finding that the switch was in manual formed the basis of the subsequent prosecution against Irwin; the wreckage was never examined by the Greek court. “The court more or less took what was in the report as gospel,” says Phil Giles. Formerly with the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Giles was brought in as a technical adviser for Irwin’s defence team. He had worked on such high-profile cases as the Lockerbie bombing, and interviewed Irwin at length. “I gave him a bit of a hard time,” he says. “He didn’t bullshit, he just came out with what he did.”\nThe cabin pressure control switch which was retrieved from the crash site. Photograph: Greek Transport Ministry\nGiles’s gut feeling was that Irwin had put the switch back to auto. His theory is that “it’s possible that the crew, for whatever reason… may have unintentionally left it in manual when they took off”. Irwin’s explanation for the crash is that the system that controlled the outflow valve failed. But, of course, there was no proof either way.\nWhen Stephen Preston appeared before the Greek courts on Boeing’s behalf, on 20 and 21 February 2008, he gave a slew of reasons why the crash had been caused by human error: one third of Helios employees were seasonal and “many did not have Greek or English as a mother tongue”; Helios engineers “failed to use common sense… by leaving the pressure system selector in manual”; the pilots were “low standard” and their “inability to work together” was “well documented”, owing in part to the East German captain’s “authoritarian nature”.\nAccording to Preston, the pilots “failed to react correctly” to the altitude warning alarm. “It appears [the first officer] reacted to what he took as a takeoff configuration warning signal, despite the fact that the plane was flying at 12,000ft.” This mix-up, he suggested, was so ridiculous as to be almost farcical. He pointed out that Boeing 737s had flown safely for decades and that, in millions of flights, “the Helios accident was the one and only accident in which pressure problems were not understood or were not put right”. But this downplayed a number of near misses and a string of complaints about the warning system.\nWhen asked by the judge, Preston acknowledged that Boeing had been informed of six “air pressure instances” before the Helios crash. On 15 February 2001, a Boeing 737 on a flight from Kristiansund to Oslo in Norway was climbing above 10,000ft when the captain and first officer were surprised to hear the warning horn. Neither associated it with a pressurisation problem. Knowing that takeoff configuration couldn’t be the cause, they assumed that the problem was the horn itself and switched it off, only realising their mistake when the oxygen masks dropped in the cabin. A further four serious pressurisation incidents, all involving confusion over the warning horn on Boeing 737s, were reported to the Irish air accident investigation unit between 2000 and 2005. In 2004, the director of Nasa’s ASRS had brought the same safety concern to Boeing’s attention. Accident investigators had identified 10 incident reports on Nasa’s database over the previous decade, in which flight crews admitted to having, at least momentarily, misinterpreted a warning horn.\nOfficers from New Scotland Yard called. They said, ‘We need to meet up.’ I was gobsmacked. I’d done nothing wrong\nPreston told the Greek judge that the main cause, in five out of the six cases, was the “repeated habits of pilots to deactivate the air-conditioning systems and the air supply pipes from the motors, in order to assist takeoff, without reactivating these functions after takeoff”.\nBut “if the director of Nasa ASRS gives you a safety alert, you do something about it,” Giles says. “Boeing didn’t. And then we had the accident.”\nIn Preston’s deposition, the assumption was that when the warning horn sounded, the pilot would know the cause and respond appropriately. But Giles points out that the startle factor is huge: “Things will go off and you think: what the hell is that?”\nPreston told the court that US aviation authorities had confirmed in 2003 that Boeing’s cabin altitude alarm system provided an “adequate level of safety”; and that, since the Helios crash, Boeing had updated its cabin crew manual to include guidance on how to differentiate between the two causes. He stressed that this “was not motivated by any notion that the 737 or any of its systems was in any way ineffective”.\nBut a document seen for the first time by the Guardian reveals quite a different picture. Eighteen months earlier, a Boeing safety assessment summary, conducted by the FAA in response to the Helios crash, had acknowledged that the pressurisation failure and the warning system were “likely a significant contributing factor”. The condition was anticipated to occur again, was “not likely to be detected by flight\/cabin\/ground crew” and brought “the airplane within one foreseeable failure of a catastrophic event”. This document, far more damning in its assessment, was not made public.\nWhen I show it to Alan Irwin he is aghast. He had no idea of its existence.\nI\nrwin was charged with manslaughter on 7 April 2008. “Officers from New Scotland Yard called me on my mobile. They said, ‘We need to meet up.’” He was served with court papers in a coffee bar at Luton airport, where he was working for easyJet. “I was gobsmacked,” he says. “Totally dismayed. I’d done nothing wrong.”\nAt the chief prosecutor’s office in Athens a month later, he was escorted by a large, powerful man with a machine gun: “I was being treated like a criminal.” The prosecutor released him to await trial in the UK.\nHis way of dealing with the court case was to remain detached. He read accident reports, canvassed experts, studied flight recorder details and won the support of Nadine Dorries, his MP. He approached it “as if I wasn’t involved, almost as a third party. That’s the only way you can keep sane.” Donna, however, was more fragile.\nOne lady in court held a picture of her son in a military uniform. She went round each of us. She was furious. She blamed us\nThe couple met when Irwin was 27 and Donna was 22. Their son was born in 1995; their daughter in 1997. “It was an awesome life and we were really happy,” he says. Then, in 1998, the couple lost their third child during labour. Donna’s womb, weakened by an earlier caesarean, collapsed during the delivery. “Our daughter, Katy, was starved of oxygen. Poor little thing was born brain-damaged and passed away within three days,” Irwin says.\nDonna had a hysterectomy: an abrupt end to the couple’s plans to have a large family. At 32, she was grieving for the loss of her child and her fertility. “She never let Katy go,” Irwin says. “It was agreed that the first one of us who passed away would be buried with Katy’s ashes.”\nIrwin says Donna’s way of coping was to drink. “It started off with just wine, then spirits, anything.” By the time Irwin was charged with manslaughter, she was already a heavy drinker. “The thought of me being incarcerated somewhere, leaving her on her own with the children, contributed to her drinking getting out of hand.”\nThe couple separated in 2009 and Irwin was awarded custody of the children. As he awaited trial, he was getting to grips with being a single father and relying on his parents, who lived nearby, for support. “I stripped out one of the bedrooms and put all the kids’ school clothes in there for the week: all lined up on hangers, one for each day, so the kids knew exactly what they had.”\nHe tried to protect his children from the court case, but they heard rumours at school. “I always played it down: ‘Don’t worry about it, Dad will sort it out.’ But they were frightened.”\nIn December 2011, six years after the crash and three years after being charged, Irwin, then 51, found himself in a courthouse in Athens, on trial for the manslaughter of 121 people. In a windowless room, he sat by his lawyer, wearing his only suit – pinstriped and made by a tailor in Kuala Lumpur when he had worked for Malaysian Airlines more than 20 years before. Nearby was Ianko Stoimenov, Helios’s chief pilot, as well as CEO Demetris Pantazis and flight operations manager Giorgos Kikkides. All four faced the same charge of manslaughter by negligence.\n“One lady came up to me in court holding a picture of her young son in a white military uniform,” Irwin remembers. “She went round each of us, one by one. She was furious. She blamed us for this boy’s death.”\nVictims’ relatives hold pictures of their loved ones outside court, in February 2009. Photograph: EPA\nThe trial occasionally descended into farce: a technical expert had Alzheimer’s, and Irwin’s barrister was compelled to join a national barristers’ strike. Phil Giles believed Irwin should never have been charged. “It’s up to the flight crew to configure the plane for flight, not the engineer,” he says now.\nStoimenov, now 59, had moved to Cyprus with his wife and two children from Bulgaria in 2000. After the accident, he lost his job and was tried for manslaughter in two court cases (the first, in Cyprus and not involving Irwin, was dismissed and the defendants acquitted).\n“When I first heard we were going to be prosecuted, my wife went to see a lawyer,” Stoimenov says. “She came back crying. Just to look into the case was €150,000. I was basically my own lawyer.” Between preparing pleas, he worked as a flying examiner and instructor in Oxford. “I don’t know how I survived. My kids were teenagers – they need you, and I was basically derailed.” His son left university in Sofia because he could no longer afford the fees.\nOn 20 April 2012, the day of the verdict, Irwin was advised not to be in court: “My barrister said, ‘If they don’t accept your appeal straight away, they may put you in prison there and then.’” He had dropped his children at school and was at home in Bedfordshire when his barrister called. He had been sentenced to 121 years – one for every person who died. “I said, ‘That’s quite a long time. Mind, the last 50 have flown by.’” The flippancy was his way of masking fear and disbelief. Later that day, his barrister called back to say his sentence had been reduced to 10 years because the court was not authorised to impose longer sentences. “I just shrugged,” Irwin says.\nHe was already looking ahead to a process he had more faith in. “I had been warned by my barrister even before the trial started that I would be found guilty, and the first time I’d get a decent hearing would be in the appeal court,” he says.\nIn the lead-up to the appeal, Irwin tried to carry on as normal, going to work. “Quite often I’d sit down in the evening with the dog next to me and go through papers, accident reports, figures,” he says. But his conviction had been widely reported. “The kids got to hear about it. I just said, ‘Don’t worry, Dad’s got it in hand.’”\nI didn’t celebrate. A lot of people perished. If the crew could come back and share a drink, that would be the day for bubbly\nThirteen months later, Irwin won his appeal. Again, his barrister advised him not to be present for the verdict. “He called saying, ‘You’ve been found not guilty’ – not exonerated, just not guilty. I didn’t celebrate. A lot of people had perished. If the cabin staff and pilots could have come back and shared a drink, that would have been the day to open a bottle of bubbly.” Donna never got to see his name cleared. She died from an alcohol-related disease in 2012. Her ashes are buried with their baby daughter’s. Most of Irwin’s legal bill was covered by insurance, but the case still cost him £60,000.\nThe other three defendants lost their appeals. Stoimenov had been sentenced to 121 years; by lunchtime that had been reduced to 10, and by the close of the day it had been converted to a fine of €79,000, payable within 10 days. He could not pay, but was saved from jail by the prime minister of Bulgaria. “The Bulgarian government was convinced I was innocent,” Stoimenov says. “Even now I have dreams of being in court. My daughter started suffering from panic attacks. There were so many years when we didn’t know which way it was going to go.”\nStoimenov and his family now live in Sofia, where he works as a pilot, although, he says, “the shadow follows me”. A 2018 job offer was withdrawn at the last minute, he thinks, “because of Helios”.\nKikkides, the flight operations manager, died of cancer in 2013. Helios CEO Pantazis retired, and is now an aviation consultant.\nIn 2007, the families of eight Cypriots who died in the crash filed for €76m (£69m) in compensation from Boeing, for having “the same alarm in place for two different types of dysfunction”, according to their lawyer, Constantinos Drougas. The case was settled out of court and the families were paid an undisclosed sum.\n“It’s a tragedy on top of a tragedy,” says Kenyon’s Robert Jensen now. “The airline made mistakes, but people shouldn’t have been sentenced to jail. What is the value of putting blame on someone else? It all comes down to dollars and cents: ‘We’re not liable – these other people are liable.’”\n‘I felt numb because of all the people on board and the crew, who were friends – I’d known them for years,’ says Alan Irwin. Photograph: David Vintiner\/The Guardian\nWhen approached by the Guardian for comment, a spokesperson for Boeing said: “The Greek Air Accident Investigation & Aviation Safety Board and the Greek courts independently found that the direct causes of the [Helios] accident were a failure to follow standard operational procedures.”\nFrom 2011, older Boeing 737s were retrofitted with two additional cockpit warning lights to alert pilots to pressurisation problems. Thousands of planes were affected by the issue.\nIrwin left easyJet at the end of his contract in 2010 and freelanced, before finally leaving the industry in January 2019, to become a property developer. He would like to see the case reopened and his colleagues cleared. “Ianko and Demetris were found guilty in a court – they were held as criminals and that will be with them for ever.”\nHe now lives with his grownup son, and is enjoying his work on an ambitious new housing development. But the many years and months he spent appealing his case will never leave him, nor the experience of being held accountable for a tragedy that was part human error, part design flaw – and one that had been flagged many times before Helios flight 522 went down.\n“I was the fall guy,” he says. “One hundred per cent.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news you provided is relevant to Navigation system failure.

He said: \"When you try to achieve great scale with automation and the automation exceeds the boundaries of human oversight, there is going to be failure. That goes for governments, for consumer companies, for Google, or a big insurance company. It is infuriating because it is driven by unreasonable greed. In many cases, the systems that tend to fail, fail because of an attempt to make them run automatically with a minimal amount of human oversight.\"\nThe Nasdaq collapse was caused by a communication failure between its platform for processing quotes and trades and that of another party – reportedly the New York Stock Exchange. So serious was the fallout that it resulted in a third fewer shares being traded in the US on that day.\n\"These outages are absolutely going to continue,\" said Neil MacDonald, a fellow at technology research firm Gartner. \"There has been an explosion in data across all types of enterprises. The complexity of the systems created to support big data is beyond the understanding of a single person and they also fail in ways that are beyond the comprehension of a single person.\"\nFrom high volume securities trading to the explosion in social media and the online consumption of entertainment, the amount of data being carried globally over the private networks, such as stock exchanges, and the public internet is placing unprecedented strain on websites and on the networks that connect them.\nBy 2017, an amount of data equivalent to all the films ever produced will be transmitted over the internet in a three-minute period, according to Cisco, a manufacturer of communications equipment.\nInternet traffic today per person is measured in gigabytes, with six gigabytes of information exchanged per human per year. In 2017, that number will have risen to 16. By then, global data will be counted in zettabytes – roughly one trillion gigabytes.\nHigh frequency trading by computers built to automate buying and selling high volumes of shares by hedge funds and banks has triggered and magnified the impact of IT failures on stockmarkets. In May 2010, $862bn (£553bn) was erased from the value of US shares in 20 minutes when one company triggered a cascade of selling.\n\"You get under the covers and high frequency trading algorithms are beyond understanding,\" said MacDonald. \"Sub-millisecond trades taking place, tens of thousands per second, and when that fails it fails spectacularly. That is what you are seeing manifested in Nasdaq.\"\nThis month's spate of outages came to international attention with the two-hour failure of the New York Times website on 14 August, during which it resorted to publishing articles on its Facebook page. While a malicious attack was initially suspected, the problem was caused simply by a scheduled system maintenance.\nOn the same day, Microsoft customers began to report email failures. The outage was traced to problems with the Exchange ActiveSync service which serves email to many of the world's smartphones. When Exchange hit a glitch, the sheer volume of phones trying to connect triggered a ripple effect that took three days to control.\nOn 16 August, many of Google's websites, from email to YouTube to its core search engine, suffered a rare four-minute global meltdown. The episode, the cause of which Google has not explained publicly, served to illustrate the sheer volume of traffic its servers process. During its outage, one monitor put the drop in global internet traffic at 40%.\nThree days later, on 19 August, Amazon's North American retail site went down for about 49 minutes, with visitors greeted with the word \"Oops\". No explanation was given, but one estimate by Forbes put the cost to Amazon at nearly $2m in lost sales.\nOn 22 August, Apple's iCloud suffered a blackout that affected a small number of its customers but lasted 11 hours. Storing the collections of photos, music, documents and address books that would once have been kept on shelves at home, iCloud now has 300 million users.\n\"The volume of data overall is absolutely exploding,\" says Rachel Dines, senior analyst at Forrester. \"This week has been especially bad for downtime. Because we are now so dependent on these high profile services we notice them more. The impacts for the companies are huge from both lost revenue but also more importantly reputation damage.\"\nJames Acres, whose company Netcraft monitors outages at data storage companies, says digital businesses are racing, not always successfully, to built the infrastructure needed to cope with the data that many consumers are gradually transferring into the cloud from the hard drives of their laptops or their collections of CDRoms.\n\"More and more people are putting their data in the cloud,\" says Acres, \"and to deal with this services are changing their back end to cope, and because it's all quite new they are experiencing some difficulties.\"As well as selling books and music, Amazon is the largest provider of public digital storage space worldwide, and this side of the business was hit by an outage in 2012 despite upgrades designed to make its servers less likely to collapse.\n\"The outage at Amazon last year was traced back to some of the processes and technologies they had put in place to make it more resilient,\" said MacDonald. \"It is almost like an auto-immune disease, where the systems they created to make it more resilient actually spread the failure more rapidly.\"\nLanier, whose Who Owns The Future? details the concentration of power among organisations with the largest computers, said outages would increase until human oversight was improved. \"We don't yet have a design for society that can run this technology well. We haven't figured out what the right human roles should be.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure.

{"num":41,"Time":"JANUARY 16, 2012","Title":"UPDATE 1-Human blunders seen at heart of Italy ship disaster","Content":"By Jonathan Saul\n* Operator said ship deviated from correct route\n* IMO may re-examine safety measures for liner industry (Adds further IMO comment)\nLONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Over-reliance on electronic navigation systems and a failure of judgment by the captain are seen as possible reasons for one of the worst cruise liner disasters of all time, maritime specialists say.\nIndustry experts say modern passenger ships such as the Costa Concordia, that ran aground off Italy’s west coast at the weekend, are equipped with state of the art global positioning systems and collision avoidance radar tracking facilities. Nevertheless, the human dimension is still vital.\n“All these gizmos are aids to navigation and it does not absolve you, as master, from taking responsibility for exercising good seamanship which is constant monitoring of your position accurately and making reference to all available material including printed charts and the local knowledge of the area,” said John Dalby, chief executive with specialists Marine Risk Management.\n“At all times the master is responsible for the safe navigation of a ship, and he ultimately bears the risk responsibility here.”\nThe operator of 114,500-tonne Costa Concordia said the captain’s actions had caused the tragedy in which at least six people died.\nDalby said there were also questions about whether there were enough qualified crew with maritime experience on board, rather than staff whose role was in passenger hospitality.\n“In a situation where you are in confined waters, things can happen very, very quickly; faster than a GPS can refresh or be referred to,” he said.\nPier Luigi Foschi, chairman and chief executive of Costa Crociere, which operates the Costa Concordia said on Monday the crew responded adequately “given the circumstances in line with the training and instruction they have received”.\nFoschi said the ship had deviated from the correct route when it hit rocks near the coast, tearing a large hole in the hull, and that the captain had contravened company safety procedures.\n“The only thing I can repeat is that was not the ordinary route that the ship was taking at the time,” he said.\nThe captain denies being too close to the coast and says the rock he hit was not marked on charts.\nSAFETY AT SEA\nOther maritime experts said a combination of human and technical errors were likely to have contributed.\n“An error chain is where several things have gone wrong,” said Len Holder, former master of the Honourable Company of Master Mariners industry association.\n“Looking at the Herald of Free Enterprise, several things went wrong, none of which should have caused the accident but when they all came up together that is where the problems occurred,” he said referring to a British car ferry disaster in which 193 people were killed.\nU.N. shipping agency the International Maritime Organization (IMO) said if necessary it would re-examine safety regulations for large cruise liners pending the outcome of investigations.\nCruise ship safety measures are regulated by IMO conventions.\n“It is important to recognise that the last century has seen an astonishing growth in legislation on the safety of shipping,” a senior ship industry source said.\n“Marine accidents are now rare events when the thousands of voyages undertaken annually in often appalling weather are taken into account. Certainly no more regulation is required but a focus on application and compliance may be something that the IMO will consider.”\nIMO Secretary-General Koji Sekimizu said the outcome of the investigations should not be pre-judged, adding that the agency should not take the accident lightly, adding that the causes of the incident were still not established.\n“We should seriously consider the lessons to be learnt and, if necessary, re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation,” he said on Monday.\nOthers said the disaster could encourage more rigorous training of crews.\n“In the immediate future aftermath if there is a higher emphasis on the inspection of cruise ships, that maybe focused towards the training and qualifications of the navigating crew and the crew that is assisting with emergency responses in terms of helping passengers,” said Ted Thompson, with the industry Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA).\nSome maritime specialists say the growing size of cruise liners has posed risks in the event of a sinking.\n“The problem with the big ones tends to be getting people off safely if there is an incident,” said Holder, who is also chairman of maritime training company Videotel.\nIndustry officials say size was not an issue.\n“Different ships are built for different markets, different routes but every cruise ship is built to operate or is certified to operate around the globe,” said Robert Ashdown, technical, environment and operations director for the European Cruise Council, the umbrella group for cruise companies.\n“These ships routinely face the worst that nature can throw at them, whether it’s the Bay of Biscay in December or whether it’s a Caribbean tropical storm or the high seas of the Antarctic ocean. These ships are stable in those conditions and they are safe.”\nCLIA’s Thompson said new cruise liners were fitted with propeller systems that enabled more manoeuvrability.\n“To actually turn a ship .. is much more quickly done than in the past,” he said. “This is such a one-off event, passengers can and should feel safe cruising on modern cruise ships.” (Additional reporting by Paul Sandle and Drazen Jorgic)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure.

The plaintiffs are bringing the lawsuit on behalf of customers who purchased or leased Ford vehicles equipped with a MyFord Touch system, as well as variations like MyLincoln Touch and MyMercury Touch.\nAccording to the lawsuit, customers have complained that the system freezes up, malfunctions, blacks out and fails to connect with mobile devices. The complaint said system flaws have created “significant safety risks” for drivers, diverting their attention from the road when the product malfunctions and failing to contact 911 during emergencies as designed.\nFord launched MyFord Touch in vehicles in 2010. The system was designed to centralize audio, navigation, climate, mobile-device, entertainment and safety controls through LCD interfaces powered by Microsoft’s Sync operating system. The MyFord Touch system can be controlled via a touch-screen panel, voice commands or by buttons on the steering wheel.\nSince its launch, however, MyFord Touch and other so-called infotainment systems in Ford vehicles have been an “unmitigated disaster,” plaintiffs said in the lawsuit.\nA representative for Ford declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.\nFord, the second-largest U.S. automaker, reported 400 problems with its MyFord Touch system for every 1,000 vehicles in November 2012. The company previously said it aims to lower that number to 360 by August.\nAutomakers have struggled to create easy-to-use and effective touch-screen systems that integrate entertainment and navigation systems.\nFord has faced public criticism over its systems from some customers. At least two websites, including syncsucks.com, have been set up to chronicle customers’ problems with the systems, the complaint said. Customers also have lodged complaints with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over the system, according to the lawsuit.\n“In theory, MyFord Touch is a brilliant idea and worth the premium that Ford charged its customers for the system,” plaintiffs’ lawyer Steve Berman of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro said in a statement. “In reality, the system is fundamentally flawed, failing to reliably provide functionality, amounting to an inconvenience at best, and a serious safety issue at worst.”\nFord said in a June press release that Sync and MyFord Touch were sold on nearly 80 percent of 2013 Ford vehicles, up from 68 percent in 2012.\nFord has issued several updates to address issues with the system, but the complaint said that the updates failed to address plaintiffs’ problems.\nThe company said in June that it is also planning to add buttons and knobs to MyFord Touch systems in future vehicles.\nPlaintiffs are seeking a court order compelling Ford to recall or replace the systems, as well as damages.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the JSON format response based on the provided news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of Navigation system failure.

{"num":56,"Time":"Mon 20 Oct 2014 23.23 CEST","Title":"Bank of England payment system crashes leaving homebuyers in limbo","Content":"The Bank of England apologised last night after a crucial payments system collapsed, forcing Mark Carney to launch an urgent investigation following the delay of hundreds of thousands of payments, including for homebuyers waiting for money to be transferred to pay for their new homes.\nThe Bank of England governor promised a “thorough, independent review” after MPs demanded answers into how the system which processes payments worth an average £277bn a day had failed for nearly 10 hours.\nAn 88-year-old woman in Sheffield was among those caught up in the collapse of the behind-the-scenes payment mechanism, which failed to open at 6am and remained shut until 3.30pm – usually the cut-off point for money to be transferred for house sales.\nThe Bank of England did not admit the shutdown had taken place for more than five hours after the system had been due to open, and was later forced to extend opening hours by four hours to 8pm to clear the backlog of 143,000 payments.\nMore than 10 hours after first admitting to the problem with the clearing house automated payment system (Chaps) the Bank of England eventually apologised “for any problems caused by the delays to the settlement system”.\nWhile Chaps was down, there were fears that homebuyers and sellers around the country would be left unable to complete purchases on time and that big businesses, which also use the system, would fail to make payments. Only weeks ago the Bank said it had a new contingency plan for the collapse of the payments system. The Bank of England will subject the system to additional monitoring when it reopens at 6am on Tuesday.\nThe systems for processing direct debits and internet transactions are not affected by the problem, which is thought to have been due to an attempt to add a new bank to Chaps over the weekend.\nEstate agents were among the first to raise concerns, with the National Association of Estate Agents warning of the “cascading” effect of the delay on payments scheduled for later in the week, and a knock-on effect on van hire and transferring gas and electricity services.\nKaye Orwin of Andersons estate agents in Sheffield had been dealing with two families aiming to complete their moves. She said her day had started with a call from solicitors to say that “money had been put in the system from the purchase at the bottom of the chain but then it couldn’t come out”.\nBy 4pm, when the money had still not been transferred, the solicitors arranged a legal undertaking agreeing that payments would be made as soon as the system recovered. This allowed the buyers to get their keys.\nThe sellers who were next up the chain, the 88-year-old woman and her son, were already packed when things went wrong. “The removal van was sat on the driveway,” said Orwin. “We’ve opened the garage and they are putting things in there for now. The buyers at the bottom of the chain have to be out of their rental home today.” She said that in more than 20 years of selling homes she had never experienced this kind of problem.\n“It is stressful enough moving house anyway without this kind of thing happening.”\nOther sellers and buyers took matters into their own hands. In Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, Amanda Hart let her buyers borrow the keys even though the money had not arrived. Banks also took steps to alleviate any problems. Barclays said it usually processed transactions 24 hours early for homebuyers, while Royal Bank of Scotland said that payments for five customers it knew were facing difficulty were processed through a different system. Nationwide building society said it had staff working late.\nIt was not immediately clear how many homebuyers people were affected by the glitch but last October nearly 2,500 house purchases a day were completed on a Monday, according to analysis of Land Registry data by Neal Hudson at property firm Savills, making Monday the third most popular day of the week to move house. Transaction levels are up markedly on 2013, suggesting more deals will have been caught in the chaos.\nChaps is a key part of the financial system, processing 92% of transactions between banks in terms of value, and is used in large-value transactions. The average payment is £2.1m. It is rare for it to be out of action for almost a whole day. It was shut for six hours in 2007 and briefly last year.\nAndrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury select committee of MPs, wrote to Carney to demand answers.\n“A crucial part of the UK’s financial infrastructure failed for several hours today,” he said. “I will be writing to the Bank of England to find out why. The whole economy depends on a reliable payment system. We need to have confidence that the cause has been found and addressed.”\nThe Bank said its independent review would “cover the causes of the incident, the effectiveness of the Bank’s response and the lessons learned for future contingency plans” and pledged to publish the findings.\nThe Law Society was also concerned. Its vice-president, Jonathan Smithers, said: “We are talking to the relevant bodies to see if we can obtain some understanding of why the system has failed and assurances that this will not occur again.”\nThe Bank of England gave few clues other than to say at 11.15am that it had been hit by a technical issue “related to some routine maintenance of the RTGS (real-time gross settlement system)”. By 4.05pm it said the system was working and would extend hours to “maximise the opportunity for settlement”. It has a backup system but did not use it.\nChaps said all payments submitted had been processed.\nPhil Kenworthy, managing director of Chaps, urged customers to contact their banks with queries and said he “would like to apologise for any delays any customers may have experienced with their payments”.\nHow Chaps works\nThe clearing house automated payment system known in City circles as Chaps describes itself as the “unsung hero” of the banking world, as it processes about 140,000 transactions a day, worth on average £277bn.\nIt means the system, part of the behind the scenes plumbing of the financial world, that moves larger size payments around the financial system, turns over the equivalent of Britain’s annual GDP every five working days.\nMoney is moved instantly between banks handling transactions for big companies, foreign exchange deals for big players in the financial markets and short-term loans between banks, companies paying their staff and. But most people will only come across the system when they need to move the significant sum required to buy a house.\nWhile homebuyers were concerned when the system stopped working for almost 10 hours on Monday, the money it processes for them is just a fraction of the transactions it handles daily. The Bank of England manually processed transactions that were crucial to the smooth running of the financial system.\nIt is one of a number of processing systems used by the Bank to shift money seamlessly. The Link system used to process cash machine payouts; Bacs, the system to process direct debits; and the fast payment system used to process internet transactions were not affected. Neither was Crest, the system used to handle share trading.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it discusses a significant failure in the Bank of England's payment system, known as Chaps (clearing house automated payment system), which is a critical part of the financial system.

But Berners-Lee’s vision for an “open platform that allows anyone to share information, access opportunities and collaborate across geographical boundaries” has been challenged by increasingly powerful digital gatekeepers whose algorithms can be weaponised by master manipulators.\n“I’m still an optimist, but an optimist standing at the top of the hill with a nasty storm blowing in my face, hanging on to a fence,” said the British computer scientist.\n“We have to grit our teeth and hang on to the fence and not take it for granted that the web will lead us to wonderful things,” he said.\nQuick Guide\nNet neutrality\nShow\nThe spread of misinformation and propaganda online has exploded partly because of the way the advertising systems of large digital platforms such as Google or Facebook have been designed to hold people’s attention.\n“People are being distorted by very finely trained AIs that figure out how to distract them,” said Berners-Lee.\nIn some cases, these platforms offer users who create content a cut of advertising revenue. The financial incentive drove Macedonian teenagers with “no political skin in the game” to generate political clickbait fake news that was distributed on Facebook and funded by revenue from Google’s automated advertising engine AdSense.\n“The system is failing. The way ad revenue works with clickbait is not fulfilling the goal of helping humanity promote truth and democracy. So I am concerned,” said Berners-Lee, who in March called for the regulation of online political advertising to prevent it from being used in “unethical ways”.\nSince then, it has been revealed that Russian operatives bought micro-targeted political ads aimed at US voters on Facebook, Google and Twitter. Data analytics firms such as Cambridge Analytica, which builds personality profiles of millions of individuals so they can be manipulated through “behavioural micro-targeting”, have also been criticised for creating “weaponised AI propaganda”.\n“We have these dark ads that target and manipulate me and then vanish because I can’t bookmark them. This is not democracy – this is putting who gets selected into the hands of the most manipulative companies out there,” said Berners-Lee.\nIt is not too late to turn things around, he said, provided people challenge the status quo.\n“We are so used to these systems being manipulated that people just think that’s how the internet works. We need to think about what it should be like,” he said.\n“One of the problems with climate change is getting people to realise it was anthropogenic – created by people. It’s the same problem with social networks – they are manmade. If they are not serving humanity, they can and should be changed,” he said.\nWill the situation get worse before it gets better? “It already has got worse,” he said, referencing the rollback of Obama-era rules to protect net neutrality.\nNet neutrality, which some have described as the “first amendment of the internet”, is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat everyone’s data equally – whether that data consists of an email from your grandmother, an episode of Stranger Things on Netflix or a bank transfer. It ensures that the large cable ISPs, including Comcast, AT&T and Verizon, don’t get to choose which data is sent more quickly and which sites get blocked or throttled depending on which content providers pay a premium.\nIn February 2015, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to more strictly regulate ISPs as utilities and enshrine in law the principles of net neutrality. Trump’s FCC, headed by the former Verizon employee Ajit Pai, wants to kill the rules, arguing that “nothing is broken” and that the rules were established over “hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom”.\nBerners-Lee, who is in Washington urging lawmakers to reconsider the rollback, disagrees and cites problematic examples in which ISPs have violated net neutrality principles. For example, AT&T blocked Skype and other similar services on the iPhone so it would make more money from regular phone calls. Verizon blocked Google Wallet from smartphones when it was developing a competing mobile payment service.\n“When I invented the web, I didn’t have to ask Vint Cerf [the ‘father of the internet’] for permission to use the internet,” said Berners-Lee, who previously stated that the internet should remain a “permissionless space for creativity, innovation and free expression”.\nThese powerful gatekeepers, Berners-Lee said, control access to the internet and pose a threat to innovation if they are allowed to pick winners and losers by throttling or blocking services. It makes sense, therefore, that ISPs should be treated more like utilities.\n“Gas is a utility, so is clean water, and connectivity should be too,” said Berners-Lee. “It’s part of life and shouldn’t have an attitude about what you use it for – just like water.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it discusses the challenges and issues facing the internet and digital systems, including the rollback of net neutrality protections.

The captain usually conducts an external inspection, while the first officer remains in the cockpit to complete preparation procedures.\nWhen manually entering the coordinates of the plane’s position, the pilot incorrectly entered the longitude from a sign outside the cockpit window as 01519.8 east (15 degrees 19.8 minutes east) instead of 15109.8 east (151 degrees 9.8 minutes east), the report said.\n“This resulted in a positional error in excess of 11,000 kilometers (6,835 miles), which adversely affected the aircraft’s navigation systems and some alerting systems,” the report said.\nREAD: The real reason airline computers crash\nThe crew had “a number of opportunities to identify and correct the error,” the report said, but didn’t notice the problem until after the plane became airborne and started tracking in the wrong direction. Several message alerts and sounds suggested the error before takeoff, but the crew ignored them, according to the report.\nOnce the captain and the first officer realized the mistake, they tried to fix the system. But it was too late.\n“Attempts to troubleshoot and rectify the problem resulted in further degradation of the navigation system, as well as to the aircraft’s flight guidance and flight control system,” the report said.\nAs systems failed further, the crew asked to return to Sydney and conduct a landing without the use of navigation systems. However, weather conditions in Sydney forced the plane to land in Melbourne instead.\nThe plane spent three hours on the ground in Melbourne before eventually departing for the Malaysian capital.\n20 planes every aviation fan should experience\nIn a statement obtained by CNN, AirAsia X said all aircraft have been equipped with upgraded flight management systems since the incident.\n“AirAsia X would like to stress that we have in place robust management systems to monitor and prevent similar incidents from reoccurring,” a representative said.\n“We also wish to reiterate that we have regularly passed safety and security audits conducted by various international regulators. … We remain committed to ensuring our compliance to all safety and security regulations.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the JSON format response based on the provided news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": [\n        \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it involves a critical error in the aircraft's navigation system.\",\n        \"The pilot entered incorrect coordinates for the plane's starting position, leading to a significant positional error of over 11,000 kilometers (6,835 miles).\",\n        \"This error adversely affected the aircraft's navigation systems and alerting systems, leading to the plane tracking in the wrong direction after takeoff.\",\n        \"Efforts to troubleshoot and rectify the problem further degraded the navigation system, flight guidance, and flight control system.\",\n        \"The crew attempted a landing without the use of navigation systems due to the system failures, which is a clear indication of a navigation system failure.\",\n        \"The diversion of the flight to Melbourne instead of Kuala Lumpur due to navigation system issues demonstrates the severity of the problem.\",\n        \"The report highlights that the crew had multiple opportunities to identify and correct the navigation error but failed to do so, leading to the navigation system's failure.\"\n    ]\n}\nThe news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it involves a critical error in the aircraft's navigation system, which led to the plane flying in the wrong direction after takeoff and ultimately being diverted to Melbourne.

And it might well be that if a number these systems fail simultaneously, it will cause commercial damage or just conceivably loss of life. This is wholly avoidable.\"\nEconomic value\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the US-operated Global Positioning System (GPS) are hugely popular and are finding more and more uses daily.\nAs well as the car dashboard device that provides directions, sat-nav systems are used by cellular and data networks, financial systems, shipping and air transport, agriculture, railways and the emergency services.\nIt is not just the excellent positioning that GNSS affords but the very precise timing information these systems deliver that has made them so popular.\nThe European Commission, in a recent update on its forthcoming Galileo sat-nav network, estimated that about 6-7% of Europe's GDP, approximately 800bn euros (£690bn) annually, was now dependent in some way on GNSS data.\nThe RAEng report claims to be the first assessment of just how many applications in the UK now use GPS signals and their like, and their probable vulnerability to an outage of some kind.\nIt says sat-nav signals are relatively weak - equivalent to receiving the light from a bright bulb at a distance of 20,000km - and this leaves them open to interference or corruption.\nTeam-work\nPossible sources include man-made ones, such as deliberate jamming, and natural hazards, such as solar activity. Both can introduce errors into the data or simply take it out altogether.\n\"The key thing for us is the concept of cascade failures,\" said report co-author Prof Jim Norton, the president-elect of BCS - the Chartered Institute for IT.\n\"This is what we characterise as accidental systems - systems that exist, but people don't recognise they exist because they don't understand the interdependencies. There will be a single common point of vulnerability and failure, but it's not obvious.\"\nDr Thomas added: \"We concluded that the UK was already dangerously dependent on GPS as a single source of position, navigation and timing (PNT) data.\n\"[We concluded] that the back-up systems are often inadequate or un-tested; that the jammers are far too easily available and that the risks from them are increasing; that no-one has a full picture of the dependencies on GPS and similar systems; and that these risks could be managed and reduced if government and industry worked together.\"\nJamming ban\nThe report makes 10 recommendations. Three relate to raising awareness of the problems and getting users to assess their own particular vulnerabilities and possible back-up solutions.\nTwo cover hardware solutions, including the suggestion of a government-sponsored R&D programme to seek better antenna and receiver technologies to enhance the resilience of systems. The report also lauds the land-based eLoran radio navigation system as a very worthy back-up technology.\nAnd five recommendations fall into the policy domain. Chief among these is the urgent suggestion that mere possession of jamming equipment be made illegal.\nCriminal gangs use this equipment to hide their activity, for example blocking the GPS tracking systems in the lorries or high-performance cars they seek to steal.\nThese jammers can be bought off the internet for as little £20. Some are capable of swamping all receivers over a wide area.\n\"It's already illegal to put GNSS jamming equipment on the market in the UK,\" said Prof Jim Norton. \"The problem is it's not necessarily illegal to hold it, to import or even to advertise it. It doesn't require legislation; it just requires [the telecoms regulator] Ofcom to place a banning order, and we would strongly recommend they do that.\"\nMedia caption,\nHow does sat-nav work?

The number of people seriously injured fell 7% to 28,954. Total casualties - deaths, serious and slight injuries - were down 3% to 271,017. There was also a significant reduction in the casualty rate for children, with 141 killed on the roads in 2005 - 25 fewer than in the previous year.\nThe DfT figures are based on accidents at which a police officer attended - estimated to be 80% of the total last year.\nExceeding the speed limit or going too fast for the conditions was said to be a contributory factor in 15% of all accidents and 26% of fatal accidents. Eight times more male than female drivers or riders involved in accidents were said to be speeding. Exceeding the speed limit was the sole factor in 5% of all accidents and 12% of fatal accidents last year.\nThe RAC Foundation expressed concern that, despite last year's small decrease, the fall in road deaths had \"plateaued out\" over the past few years. Edmund King, executive director of the foundation, said: \"For a number of years we have been arguing that we need to know more about the causes of crashes so that they can be addressed.\n\"Cars have become 'second homes' for drivers, kitted out with the latest mod cons which also present considerable distractions. These figures suggest that all drivers need to concentrate more on the road ahead rather than on their phones, passengers, music, food, drinks, navigation systems, or countryside clutter of signs. We need to get drivers to take more responsibility for their actions.\"\nKevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: \"This report shows that we have to re-emphasise the need to continue with the overall campaign against speed. It is not just about cameras - we have to continue with engineering measures, traffic calming, advertising and speed awareness courses. Manufacturers need to do more to make it easier for drivers to see what speed their vehicle is doing.\"\nSome statisticians point out that the DfT figures are based on police reports, not those from hospitals, so could underestimate the casualty rate.\nShadow transport secretary Chris Grayling said: \"The government should start taking proper action to deal with the problem, and stop sheltering behind statistics about which there are very real concerns.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it discusses the causes of road accidents, and one of the factors mentioned is the distraction caused by navigation systems.

{"num":72,"Time":"Wed 18 Sep 2013 01.06 CEST","Title":"Abandoned NHS IT system has cost £10bn so far","Content":"An abandoned NHS patient record system has so far cost the taxpayer nearly £10bn, with the final bill for what would have been the world's largest civilian computer system likely to be several hundreds of millions of pounds higher, according a highly critical report from parliament's public spending watchdog.\nMPs on the public accounts committee said final costs are expected to increase beyond the existing £9.8bn because new regional IT systems for the NHS, introduced to replace the National Programme for IT, are also being poorly managed and are riven with their own contractual wrangles.\nWhen the original plan was abandoned the total bill was expected to be £6.4bn.\nRichard Bacon, a Conservative member of the committee, said the report was further evidence of a \"systemic failure\" in the government's ability to draw up and manage large IT contracts. \"This saga is one of the worst and most expensive contracting fiascos in the history of the public sector.\n\"Yet, as the much more recent universal credit project shows, there is still a long way to go before government departments can honestly say that they have learned and properly applied the lessons from previous contracting failures.\"\nPrevious IT-related government problems have included a breakdown of the child support agency, which left thousands of families without money; chaos within the passport agency; a tax credit system which was left vulnerable to fraud; late payments from the rural payments agency; and difficulties in tracking foreign national prisoners.\nA report last week by the National Audit Office estimated that in 2012 at least £480bn of the government's operating revenues and at least £210bn of non-staff expenditure such as pensions and entitlements were reliant to some extent on older IT systems.\nThe PAC report highlighted a new NHS computer system called Lorenzo which was supposed to store data for 220 trusts in the north, eastern England and the Midlands at a cost of £3.1bn. But the final contract for that project alone is likely to cost the Department of Health £2.2bn and cover only 22 trusts, MPs said.\nSuccessive ministers and civil servants have been blamed by committee members for the NHS project, which has been described as the biggest IT failure ever seen. Bacon, who has co-written a book on failing government projects, said that the NHS's particular problems stem from the original contracts signed before 2002.\n\"The department [of health]'s latest estimate of £9.8bn leaves out the future costs of Lorenzo or the potential large future costs arising from the department's termination of Fujitsu's contract for care records systems in the South of England. It is a pitiful waste,\" he said.\nThe project was launched in 2002 but was beset by changing specifications, technical challenges and disputes with suppliers which left it years behind schedule and over budget. In September 2011 ministers announced they would dismantle the National Programme but in an effort to salvage something from the failure said they would keep the component parts in place with separate management and accountability structures.\nThe committee's report, issued today, has examined the new structures and found a number of significant failures.\nThey focused on the government's decision to renegotiate its original £3.1bn contract with the IT systems group Computer Science Corporation for care records systems across 220 trusts in the North, Midlands and East, following delays and problems.\nThe government's negotiating position was weakened, the report claimed, by the Department of Health's failure to meet contractual obligations. CSC's contracts could not be cancelled because a legal challenge by the company may well have succeeded, the report claimed.\nHowever, 10 years on CSC has still not delivered the software and \"not a single trust has a fully functioning Lorenzo care records system\". This failure, the report said, was \"extraordinary\", while CSC was accused of a \"failure to deliver\" and \"poor performance\".\nMPs also expressed surprise that the government's estimates of future costs have not taken into account the termination of contracts with another major IT supplier, Fujitsu.\nThat contract was dissolved in 2008, but the government and the Japanese firm are still in dispute over compensation. The government's legal costs have been £31.5m over the last four years, the report disclosed.\nA CSC spokesman claimed three hospitals were already using the Lorenzo system. \"Services provided by CSC under the programme reach 500,000 registered NHS users and support 25 million patient records. Three hospital trusts are already successfully running their day-to-day operations using the Lorenzo electronic patient record system. A further six trusts so far have chosen to take the system under the interim agreement signed with the NHS in August 2012.\"\nThe government was keen to distance itself from the problem.\nThe health minister, Dan Poulter, said: \"We can't let their [Labour's] failure hold patients back from seeing the benefits of the technology revolution that is transforming daily lives all around us. That's why we've set up a £1bn technology fund to help the NHS go paperless by 2018. This is the opposite to Labour's approach where a one-size fits all solution was clunkily imposed from Whitehall.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it discusses an abandoned NHS patient record system that has cost nearly £10 billion to date.

Instead, he called for an investment programme to increase the number of flood-warning sirens in areas that could see more floods in the coming years.\nThe disaster assistance agency has been facing scrutiny since last year’s “nationwide emergency warning day”, the first test run of the country’s warning infrastructure since reunification in 1991. Slated to run for 20 minutes, the event on 10 September 2020 was meant to demonstrate the functionality of everything from sirens to push notifications on smartphones.\nInstead, the warning day demonstrated the current system’s gaps, with many receiving push alerts with a delay or not at all, after the nationwide push overloaded the system.\n‘Like a bomb went off’: survivors of Germany’s worst floods in 200 years relive their agony\nRead more\nAnnalena Baerbock, the Green party’s candidate for chancellor at elections this September, told Der Spiegel that the appropriate response to the catastrophic floods was a “tripartite national effort of strength”, involving a more centralised disaster management system, readjusting the design of cities and rivers for the event of more extreme weather events, and increased efforts on climate protection.\n“We need to reshape disaster management,” Baerbock said. “And the federal government needs to take more responsibility for it.”\nAs receding water levels laid bare the full extent of the damage in towns and villages in western Germany, residents feared they could be left without access to power and drinking water for months.\nIn Ahrweiler, about 30,000 are currently without power, drinking water and gas, after Wednesday’s flash floods broke up sewage systems, tore through a major gas pipeline and brought a purification plant to a standstill.\n“It looks like the infrastructure is destroyed so badly that some places won’t have drinking water for weeks or months,” the mayor of the town of Altenahr, Cornelia Weigand, told the newspaper Bild.\n“It is clear that our community will end up looking very different, because those buildings that defined the area for more than 50, 100 or 150 years will have to be torn down.”\nEven water towers in parts of the area that were spared the worst of the floods had run dry and had to be refilled either through tank lorries or by reviving disused wells and setting up mobile water treatment units, local media reported on Monday.\nGermany’s Red Cross has transported two 7,000-litre (1,500 gallon) and four 3,800-litre tanks of drinking water into the region.\nThe Koblenz-based energy provider EVM said it was still in the process of establishing exactly how many households in Ahrweiler were without gas, which is used to heat water and homes in the region, but that the damage to its supply system was “dramatic”.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it discusses the failure of the German flood alert system to effectively warn and protect communities from extreme weather events, including record rainfall and expected floods.

The jury had deliberated for 19 hours over four days.\nThe campus deputy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, Peterson had been charged with failing to confront the shooter Nikolas Cruz during his six-minute attack inside a three-story 1200 building on 14 February 2018 that left 17 dead.\nHe could have received nearly 100 years in prison, although a sentence even approaching that length would have been highly unlikely given the circumstances and his clean record. He also could have lost his $104,000 annual pension.\nProsecutors, during their two-week presentation, called to the witness stand students, teachers and law enforcement officers who testified about the horror they experienced and how they knew where Cruz was. Some said they knew for certain that the shots were coming from the 1200 building. Prosecutors also called a training supervisor who testified Peterson did not follow protocols for confronting an active shooter.\nPeterson’s attorney, Mark Eiglarsh, during his two-day presentation, called several deputies who arrived during the shooting and students and teachers who testified they did not think the shots were coming from the 1200 building. Peterson, who did not testify, has said that because of echoes, he could not pinpoint the shooter’s location.\nEiglarsh also emphasized the failure of the sheriff’s radio system during the attack, which limited what Peterson heard from arriving deputies.\nSecurity videos show that 36 seconds after Cruz’s attack began, Peterson exited his office about 100 yards (92 meters) from the 1200 building and jumped into a cart with two unarmed civilian security guards. They arrived at the building a minute later.\nPeterson got out of the cart near the east doorway to the first-floor hallway. Cruz was at the hallway’s opposite end, firing his AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle.\nPeterson, who was not wearing a bullet-resistant vest, did not open the door. Instead, he took cover 75ft (23 meters) away in the alcove of a neighboring building, his gun still drawn. He stayed there for 40 minutes, long after the shooting ended and other police officers had stormed the building.\nPeterson spent nearly three decades working at schools, including nine years at Stoneman Douglas. He retired shortly after the shooting and was then fired retroactively.\nCruz’s jury could not agree he deserved the death penalty. The 24-year-old former Stoneman Douglas student was then sentenced to life in prison.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is about a sheriff's deputy, Scot Peterson, who was acquitted of felony child neglect and other charges for failing to act during the 2018 Parkland school massacre.

Gerstenmaier said it would likely take days to find out why the computers were misbehaving.\nWork continued on Thursday on the retraction of the second half of an older solar wing panel that must be moved before the new array can rotate and track the sun for full power.\nSpacewalking astronauts Patrick Forrester and Steven Swanson helped guide the old wing into its storage box on Wednesday. Their crewmates James Reilly and John “Danny” Olivas are due to finish the job during a spacewalk on Friday.\nReilly and Olivas also are scheduled to repair a bit of protruding insulation near the rear of the shuttle. A corner of the blanket tore loose during Atlantis’ launch six days ago, potentially exposing inner layers of the shuttle’s surface to superheated gases on re-entry.\nSlideshow ( 6 images )\nNASA had already extended Atlantis’ mission from 11 to 13 days and added a fourth spacewalk to make sure there was enough time to fix the blanket and retract the old solar wing.\nThe astronauts must also prepare other station systems for the arrival of new laboratory units and life support equipment for an expanded, six-person resident crew.\nThe U.S. space agency has three years to finish building the complex before the shuttles, which are the only vehicles capable of hauling major components into orbit, are retired.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure.

We will work with other banks to ensure that customers do not lose out as a result of today’s problems.”\nSalaries are not the only payments affected by the IT failure.

{"num":79,"Time":"Tue 21 Jul 2015 17.14 CEST","Title":"Navigating decline: what happened to TomTom?","Content":"A\nt the end of 2007, TomTom was on top of the world. The Dutch satnav maker had taken record revenues of €634m (£445m) in the Christmas quarter, sold a record 4.2m devices, and was making a net profit of €107m, an all-time high. The fall, when it came, was going to be hard, and it took less than two years: by the first quarter of 2009, revenues had slumped to €213m and it recorded a net loss of €37m.\nWhat happened? Corinne Vigreux, the chief executive who is also one of TomTom’s four co-founders, puts it down to two factors: “The economic crisis in 2008 – plus smartphones became popular, and Google began offering navigation for free on [Android-powered] phones.”\nThe arrival of a search engine company in the field of in-car navigation is not the sort of threat you would normally plan for. But Vigreux, 50, has seen enough change in the technology business to know that “your competitors come from different fields – they’re not the ones you expect them to be. Hilton Hotels would never have expected their margins would be eaten away by Airbnb. Every company starts with a blank sheet of paper, and some of them then arrive like a tsunami.”\nFor TomTom, survival would quickly become a matter of adapting to the new reality, in which Google could undermine the paid-for satnav business – which was then selling millions of units each quarter – with software that would quickly be in everyone’s hands. But where would the money come from?\nTomTom had already decided that the future lay in providing map data and telematics for vehicle makers. In July 2007, it made a €2bn offer for Tele Atlas, the company’s map data supplier, which was one of only two independent mapping companies (and also supplied Google). In October 2007, Nokia bid €5.7bn for Navteq, the other independent. US-based Garmin tried to snatch Tele Atlas, but a brief bidding war saw TomTom prevail with a €2.9bn bid; the deal closed in June 2008.\nNokia relaunches its HERE maps and navigation app for iOS\nRead more\nBut the stock market did not like TomTom’s purchase, which was funded by debt and a new share issue. Its shares plunged from their high of €64.80. At the start of 2009, the company wrote off more than €1bn on the Tele Atlas purchase. Shares hit an all-time low of €2.84.\nFor Vigreux, however, reinvention and building from the ground up is what she is used to. Her first managerial role was running exports at Psion, the iconic and hugely influential British technology company, in the 1990s. She travelled widely, which was her original aim in getting into business. “North Africa, Israel, Europe,” she said, having joined Psion from business school in 1987.\nPsion was a stalwart of British technology, producing a much loved handheld computer series that rivalled the Palm, from the US, in the 1990s. But the rise of mobile phones pushed it to a software-only path: its Symbian software became the basis of the first successful range of smartphones, from Nokia.\nVigreux is following a similar route. After four years at Psion – “it was one of the most interesting tech startups around; we learned a lot, there was a bunch of smart people” – she moved to Holland to join a software distributor for the Psion and other handhelds, and then helped set up TomTom in 1991. Initially, it made business-facing products for meter reading and barcodes for the popular handhelds – Palm Pilot, Compaq iPaq and Psion Series 5. Smartphones were not yet in use.\nAt first, it wrote mapping applications for the handhelds, squeezing data into tiny (by today’s standards) amounts of storage. “It was very difficult to put everything into one product; we had a city [map] product, but we were already very good at compressing data so we could fit it in.”\nThe company then saw an opportunity to make mapping devices for consumers. Before May 2000, civilian GPS systems were accurate to within only 100 metres; only the military could get its “full” accuracy of a few metres. But a Bill Clinton-enacted change made it open, and Vigreux and the team at TomTom saw an opportunity.\nRather than having to rely on people who already owned expensive PDAs, they realised they could sell them dedicated objects for less. The first, the TomTom GO, cost £499 and was released in March 2004. “And the first touchscreen,” Vigreux says proudly. “We created the [satnav] category.”\nThe emergence of Google Maps was one of the key reasons for TomTom’s revenues and profits plunging after 2007. Photograph: Dado Ruvic\/Reuters\nThe market exploded; Vigreux and the team, now 40-strong, saw the business grow from revenues of €42m to €1.8bn in four years. “We probably drove the Ferrari close to the cliff a few times,” she says, laughing. “It’s not so much the technology that’s difficult to handle; it’s the part of the iceberg that you don’t see – the operations, the planning, the forecasts – and that’s with a four-to-six-month lead time for some of the products.” Coping with growth was a challenge: “It got faster and faster, without a stop button.”\nThe abrupt braking, when it came, hit the company hard. In mid-2011, it recorded another €500m write-off on the dwindling outlook for the standalone satnav market. Tele Atlas services generated much smaller revenues than selling physical devices; in retrospect, the purchases of Tele Atlas and Navteq were fuelled by legitimate fears that Google and smartphones would change the world of mapping, away from high-priced profitable devices to lower-priced services. And keeping maps updated is expensive – the world keeps changing. The analyst Horace Dediu estimates that each mapmaker’s annual upkeep costs are at least $1bn.\nAs a result, TomTom is seeking new sources of revenue beyond in-car satnavs. It recently collaborated with Nike on a sports watch with inbuilt GPS.\nHowever, it is the potential for self-driving vehicles that Vigreux is most keen to exploit. She said: “They will have a massive impact on the way we live. At present, our cars aren’t used very much in the day; maybe when they can drive themselves it’ll be more efficient, and there will be fewer on the road.” The key, though, will be the mapping data, and information about road conditions. This is where TomTom hopes to eke out an advantage by offering 3D features that it can update in real time – quicker than Google.\nMeanwhile, Nokia is selling Navteq, rebranded as HERE, with a price tag that could top £2.5bn, and the most likely buyer is a consortium of German luxury carmakers: Audi, BMW and the Mercedes-Benz owner, Daimler.\nApple maps: how Google lost when everyone thought it had won\nRead more\nTomTom is a smaller business now: its first-quarter revenues were €205m with an operating profit of €21.4m, but net loss of €7m. Despite this, Vigreux says she is optimistic about the future. Yet she still frets about the state of consumer electronics companies in Europe compared to their rivals in the US. Vigreux said: “In Europe, we invented GSM [the system used worldwide for mobile phones]. Today everyone uses a phone. Yet there aren’t any big European players in the field. Consumer technology makers are disappearing: Nokia, Sagem, Philips, Alcatel.” Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft last year – it now makes mobile network equipment.\nAnd she is proud that “we’re the only entrepreneurial consumer electronics company to come out of Europe with a global business”. So why the lack of others? Waze and DeepMind, two of the most innovative non-US companies (in travel and artificial intelligence) were both snapped up by Google. “Maybe we sell out too quickly - look at Skype as well,” Vigreux says. “Regulation might be part of it, but in the end the technology that consumers believe in and demand will win. Look at Uber - it is coming to a market that was over-regulated.\n“But we shouldn’t look for excuses. Maybe there isn’t the right ecosystem of capital, entrepreneurs and universities together. But we have got the talent and the creativity.”\nDoes she support the idea of quotas for women in boardrooms? Vigreux replies: “I think some countries do need quotas, just to put it under the spotlight. But it’s better just done naturally. If we want more women in the board, then we need more executives, so you need more earlier in the organisation, and they need a career path through the organisation.”\nIn fact, she thinks, the lack of talented staff is “the biggest issue most organisations are facing. You have to fish in a bigger pond to fill those gaps. So of course you should look at women too”.\nVigreux is always watching out for new challengers, having seen Google come from nowhere to undermine what was a solid business. But for now, she is keeping her balance – and finding a new route through all the change.\n****\nCorinne Vigreux\nCorinne Vigreux.

It flew horizontally and began to come apart in flames, crashing in a ball of fire near the launch pad.\nRussian Prime Minster Dmitry Medvedev, who has said that Russia has lost 10 satellites in seven failed launches in just over one year, ordered tighter controls put in place to avoid more embarrassing mishaps, his spokeswoman told Interfax.\nThe crash, which echoes the costly loss of three navigation satellites in 2010, will further damage the reputation of Russia’s once-pioneering space programme, cause delays in launches and threaten its hold on some 40 percent of the market for space launches.\nRussia’s space agency Roscosmos said the accident had been caused by the emergency switch-off of the rocket’s engines 17 seconds into the flight. The shutdown could have been caused by a problem with the engine or the guidance system, the state-run RIA news agency reported.\nThe rocket contained 172 tonnes of highly toxic heptyl propellant, Kazakh Emergencies Minister Vladimir Bozhko told an emergency government meeting.\nTalgat Musabayev, head of Kazakhstan’s space agency Kazcosmos, said nitric oxide - a product of burning heptyl - was much less toxic for humans. He said it was raining in the area, so toxic clouds would probably not reach the town of Baikonur some 60 km (38 miles) away.\nHowever, the authorities instructed locals to stay at home and not to open windows, and ordered to close shops and public catering, said Kazakh Interior Minister Kalmukhambet Kasymov.\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\nThe estimated loss from the three satellites, meant for the trouble Glonass satellite navigation system, was about $200 million, Rossiya-24 reported.\nRussia plans to spend more than 300 billion roubles (5.9 billion pounds) by 2020 on Glonass, its answer to the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) system.\nThe system, first conceived by the Soviet Union more than 40 years ago, has been plagued by failed launches, including one in 2010 in which three satellites were also lost, and by suspicions of corruption and embezzlement. Its chief designer was dismissed last year during a fraud investigation.\nRussia’s workhorse Proton rocket, known at the time under its UR-500 code, made its first test flights in the mid-1960s.\nIt was originally designed as an intercontinental ballistic missile to carry a nuclear warhead targeting the Soviet Union’s Cold War foe the United States. But it was never deployed as a nuclear weapon.\nSeveral crashes of Proton rockets accompanied by spills of heptyl have led to temporary strains in relations between Russia and Kazakhstan.\nRussia is increasing spending on space and plans to send a probe to the moon in 2015, but the pioneering programme that put the first man in space in 1961 has been plagued in recent years by setbacks, including botched satellite launches and a failed attempt to send a probe to a moon of Mars.\nAdditional reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel and Steve Gutterman in Moscow and Raushan Nurshayeva in Asatana; Writing by Dmitry Solovyov; Editing by Jon Boyle\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about a Russian rocket carrying three navigation satellites worth around $200 million crashing shortly after lift-off from the Russian-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan.

{"num":87,"Time":"Wed 14 Apr 2021 01.01 CEST","Title":"‘The heat is on’: top theatres act to root out ‘system failure’ of racism","Content":"The Young Vic and Royal Court theatres have entered into a pioneering consultation process that aims to identify and root out systemic racism from their venues. The artistic directors of both London institutions have signed up to a two-year partnership with the social enterprise Sour Lemons that will interrogate the internal structures that uphold institutional racism, raise awareness and accountability, and listen to staff’s experiences of racism inside the buildings.\nIt's going to be painful and slow\nKwame Kwei-Armah\nKwame Kwei-Armah, artistic director of the Young Vic, said that almost a year on from the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests, it was imperative to shore up statements of hope and support with concrete commitment to equality in the arts. “As an organisation, this is a KPI [key performance indicator] for us,” he said. “When we get to one year on from George Floyd, we will think, ‘What have we done?’ We will be listening and reflecting and, after that, we will be taking action. It’s going to be painful and slow. Anyone who thinks it can be done overnight believes in miracles, but we are trying to work towards the miracle of equality.”\nKwei-Armah felt it was not enough to have a black figurehead at the helm of an organisation in order to stamp out ingrained institutional prejudice. “There’s a system in place that is deeper than a single figurehead. I inherited a building that was very progressive, but it’s not enough now.”\nWendell Pierce and Sharon D Clarke in Death of a Salesman, directed by Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell for the Young Vic in 2019. Photograph: Tristram Kenton\/The Guardian\nVicky Featherstone, artistic director of the Royal Court, said the pandemic had exposed the industry’s “fragilities” and could spur it towards positive change: “The rupture of not being able to make theatre this past year has given us important time for reflection. We can’t possibly go back to the same thing. The structures we have all inherited in theatre are extraordinarily patriarchal and institutionally racist as well. There are hundreds and hundreds of years we need to unpick.”\nFeatherstone, who announced an Anti-Racist Reflection and Action plan for her theatre last June, spoke of this collaboration as a way to “hold up a mirror to ourselves” and said it felt like an unprecedented step in her 30-year career: “Nobody has done this work before in my experience. I want people from all backgrounds to have a voice and impact the way we are run. It’s about genuine empowerment.”\nThe work would also address the plays staged and archived at the Royal Court, she said. “We have all inherited certain narrative structures. Some still stand but a lot of them need to be interrogated. Who are the people who shape the stories we tell? Who decides what a good play looks like? In the end, the biggest change will be in telling stories differently.”\nArtistic directors Kwame Kwei-Armah and Vicky Featherstone. Composite: Leon Puplett\/Helen Murray\nSade Banks, CEO of Sour Lemons, said that up to 30 leading arts organisations had applied for help following the BLM movement last year, out of which the Young Vic and Royal Court were selected. The process was not about “shaming” but about identifying areas for change, she said. “We are not the race police but racism lives in secrecy. Most white liberal leaders can understand racism, but think it’s ‘over there’. The minute you understand that it’s in your institution, you can do something about it.”\nWho are the people who shape the stories we tell? In the end, the biggest change will be in telling stories differently.\nVicky Featherstone\nAs part of the consultation, there will be two working groups: an anti-oppression group made up of white senior leaders and an accountability group of staff with mixed racial identities.\nMeanwhile, Featherstone dismissed the recent findings of the Sewell Report in relation to this consultation process. “In the past year at the Royal Court, I have never felt that the heat has been off in the need for change. But [the report] gives even more fuel to the work we are about to undertake.”\nKwei-Armah said: “There are very few people who would look at the data – both anecdotally and at the naked numbers involved in areas such as mental health, prison, the City, teaching and education – and not recognise that there was something happening on a holistic level. To think that the arts are not part of this system failure would be naive. I want to speak specifically about my sector, this theatre, and about the need for it to fairly and equally represent the make-up of our society in every way.”\nThis article was amended on 15 April 2021 to include the information, in an image caption, that Death of a Salesman at the Young Vic was co-directed by Miranda Cromwell.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of 'Navigation system failure' because it discusses a system failure within the context of racism in the theater industry.

The telescope has discovered scores of planets but only two so far that show strong signs of being habitable.\n\"I wouldn't call Kepler down and out just yet,\" said Nasa sciences chief John Grunsfeld.\nNasa said Kepler had lost two out of four wheels that control its orientation in space, meaning it can't point at stars with the same precision.\nIn orbit around the sun, 40m miles (65m kilometres) from Earth, Kepler is too far away to send astronauts on a repair mission like Nasa did to the Hubble telescope. Engineers on the ground are trying to restart one of Kepler's faulty wheels or find a workaround. The telescope could be used for other purposes if it can no longer track down planets.\nKepler was launched in 2009 in search of Earth-like planets. So far it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 potential ones. Its mission was supposed to be over by now but in 2012 Nasa agreed to keep it running through 2016 at a cost of about $20m a year.\nIn April Kepler scientists announced the discovery of a distant duo that seems ideal for some sort of life to flourish. The other planets found by Kepler haven't fitted all the criteria that would make them right for life of any kind, from microbes to humanoids.\nWhile ground telescopes can hunt for planets outside our solar system, Kepler is much more advanced and is the first space mission dedicated to that goal.\nFor the past four years Kepler has focused its telescope on a faraway patch of the Milky Way where there are more than 150,000 suns, recording slight dips in brightness that give away a planet passing in front of a star.\nNow \"we can't point where we need to point. We can't gather data,\" deputy project manager Charles Sobeck said.\nScientists said there was a backlog of data they still needed to analyse even if Kepler stopped looking for planets. \"I think the most interesting, exciting discoveries are coming in the next two years. The mission is not over,\" said chief scientist William Borucki at the Nasa Ames research centre in northern California, which manages the mission.\nScientists who have no role in Kepler mourned the news, saying the spacecraft may not be able to determine how many Earth-size planets are in the \"Goldilocks zone\" where it's not too hot or too cold for water to exist in liquid form on the surface. They praised the data collected by Kepler so far but said several more years of observations were needed to analyse it all.\n\"This is one of the saddest days in my life. A crippled Kepler may be able to do other things but it cannot do the one thing it was designed to do,\" said Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.\nIn 2017 Nasa plans to launch Tess – the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – designed to search for planets around nearby stars.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Navigation system failure because it discusses the failure of NASA's Kepler space telescope.

Instead they were forced to ferry tapes there by taxi and tube from the archive storage facility in Perivale, north-west London.\nIn an email to all BBC staff on Friday, director-general Tony Hall said he was halting DMI and admitted: \"We have a responsibility to spend licence-fee payers' money as if it was our own and I'm sorry to say we did not do that here.\"\nOne insider called the DMI project \"the axis of awful\", while another source said: \"The scale of the project was too big and it got out of hand.\"\nJohn Linwood, the BBC's chief technology officer who was responsible for the running of the project, has temporarily been replaced by BBC News head of technology Peter Coles. Linwood was appointed in 2009 from Yahoo and had formerly worked at Microsoft. He receives a £287,000 salary and was one of four of the organisation's top managers to receive a bonus last year – in his case amounting to £70,000.\nBBC Trust member Anthony Fry said the project had \"generated little or no assets\" for the corporation. In a letter to Margaret Hodge MP, who chairs the public accounts committee, which investigated the project, he said: \"This is because much of the software and hardware which has been developed could only be used by the BBC if the project were completed, a course of action which, due to technological difficulties and changes to business needs, would be, I fear, equivalent to throwing good money after bad.\"\nDMI has cost £98.4m, and was meant to bring £95.4m of benefits to the organisation by making all the corporation's raw and edited video footage available to staff for re-editing and output. In 2007, when the project was conceived, making a single TV programme could require 70 individual video-handling processes; DMI was meant to halve that.\nAn independent review by PricewaterhouseCoopers will investigate what went wrong in the project management, control and governance. Some problems were significant: after just 24 months, the project was 21 months behind schedule.\nHall said off-the-shelf tools were now available that could do the same job \"that simply didn't exist five years ago\", and that all the assets from the project are being written off. The BBC declined to specify which editing tools Hall was referring to. Avid's Pro Tools and Apple's Final Cut Pro software are popular with other professional sound and video editors, but both have been available for more than a decade.\nOnly DMI's \"Fabric archive database\", first rolled out in 2012 to help staff search and request access to tapes and other media, will be retained – although even that is understood also to have been criticised by users as slower than existing libraries with tape copies, and was the system that failed calamitously after Thatcher's death.\nRob Wilson, the Conservative MP for Reading East, said: \"The BBC spent well over £100m experimenting with a system that it appears was highly unlikely to work. It is a disaster for the BBC but a bigger disaster for the licence fee payer.\"\nThe BBC initially awarded a £79m contract to Siemens in February 2008 without open competition, a Public Accounts Select Committee report noted in April 2011, but no technology was delivered and it was terminated in July 2009. The BBC then brought the project inhouse, clawing back £27.5m from Siemens – but was still unable to bring costs under control, and did not deliver the software required.\nThe PAC in 2011 noted that instead of saving £17.9m, the DMI had cost it a net £38.2m.

{"num":8,"Time":"Wed 13 Feb 2013 08.00 CET","Title":"Thousands using GPS jammers on UK roads pose risks, say experts","Content":"Thousands of people in the UK are using \"GPS jammers\" that plug into car cigarette lighters and can stop tracking systems used to detect stolen cars, monitor vehicle use or stop drivers working overlong hours, according to new findings from experts.\nThat could lead to the danger of overtired lorry drivers staying on the roads despite the presence of monitoring equipment, and could also pose a threat if vehicles equipped with the jammers were to go on to airport areas near aircraft which rely on GPS (global positioning system) for navigation.\nYet despite the risks posed by the devices – which are sold over the internet – it is not illegal to import, sell, buy or possess them. It is an offence only under the Wireless Telegraphy Act to \"knowingly use\" such a device to block GPS signals – though the communications regulator Ofcom is looking to close some of the loopholes.\nThe growing use of the devices could also torpedo any plans to introduce \"pay as you drive\" insurance or road toll systems if the vehicle owner was able to block communications with monitoring systems.\n\"When people use these, it creates a bubble around their vehicle for about 500 metres that jams any GPS receiver or transmitter,\" Prof Charles Curry of Chronos Technology told the Guardian. \"It stops any tracking system the owner might have put on the car. Usually they will block GSM [mobile phone] signals too that might also be used to send back a location.\n\"It means that for anyone trying to track the vehicle, it just vanishes off the map – it's as though it were in an underground car park,\" Curry added.\nPolice have already seized one jammer that was being used by a van driver following tests by the team, who have built a system that can detect the disruption caused by the jammers.\nBob Cockshott, of the ICT Knowledge Transfer Network, said: \"People are using these because they don't want to be detected. It's very easy to drown out the signal from a GPS satellite – which at ground level puts out as much power as a 20-watt lightbulb 12,000 miles away.\"\nWhen engineers began monitoring traffic on a dual carriageway outside London, and compared it with traffic on roads inside the City of London, they discovered regular use of jammers, with 10 incidents per day by some roads. That would translate to thousands of users around the country, given the amount of traffic on the road.\n\"It may be truck drivers making deliveries outside hours, or taxi drivers who are working for a company and want to keep all the payments for themselves rather than splitting it with the cab owner,\" said Curry.\nBut Curry and Cockshott said that the use of jammers carried broader risks, not just from overtired drivers. \"They could affect aircraft navigation systems, and for drivers in the immediate area they could mess up their GPS reception because these wipe out those signals,\" said Curry.\nIn fact one online review of a jammer by a user included the complaint that their GPS didn't work when it was active.\nHowever the availability of such jammers pales in comparison to the Russian-built ones deployed by North Korea, which are reputedly able to affect systems as much as 100km away – and which were used in May 2012 to scramble GPS signals near two of South Korea's major airports.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Based on the provided news article, it appears to be related to Unauthorized GPS tracking, as it discusses the use of \"GPS jammers\" in the UK, which can interfere with tracking systems and GPS signals.

{"num":6,"Time":"5:51 PM GMT+1•December 14, 2021","Title":"Apple releases ‘Tracker Detect’ Android app to help users discover unknown nearby AirTags","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Apple\nApple has released a new Android app called “Tracker Detect” to help people who don’t own Apple products to identity unexpected AirTags near them in an effort to boost privacy. If a user thinks they may be being tracked, they can use the app to scan for nearby AirTags. If the app finds any, it will flag it as an “unknown AirTag.” If a detected item tracker is known to be moving with a user for more than 10 minutes, users will be able to play a sound on the detected item tracker to help locate it. From there, the user will be given instructions on how to learn more about it and how to disable it by removing the battery.\n“Tracker Detect looks for item trackers that are separated from their owner and that are compatible with Apple’s Find My network,” the app description reads. “These item trackers include AirTag and compatible devices from other companies. If you think someone is using AirTag or another device to track your location, you can scan to try to find it.”\nAt launch, the Tracker Detect app is compatible with supported Find My network supported item trackers, which include Apple’s AirTag and the Chipolo ONE Spot. It won’t work to find other non-Find My compatible trackers, like Tile, for example.\nIt also can’t help users keep track of AirTags associated with an Apple account, so it can’t be used to actually take advantage of AirTags’ full capabilities.\n“AirTag provides industry-leading privacy and security features and today we are extending new capabilities to Android devices,” a spokesperson for Apple told TechCrunch in an email, confirming the new app’s launch. “Tracker Detect gives Android users the ability to scan for an AirTag or supported Find My enabled item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge.”\nImage Credits: Apple\nSince the launch of Tracker Detect yesterday, the app’s page on the Google Play Store has been flooded with negative reviews. Many reviewers say the app would benefit from an automated detection feature instead of relying on users to manually scan for unknown AirTags. Other users have stated that the app has been unable to detect AirTags in their homes. It’s worth noting that the AirTag needs to be away from its paired device for at least 10 minutes before Tracker Detect is able to detect it and notify the user. TechCrunch has reached out to Apple for a comment.\nThe launch of the new app follows concerns that Apple’s AirTag could be used to secretly track people, as they’re small enough to be discreetly placed in a bag or a coat. A Washington Post report from earlier this year explained how Apple’s AirTags made it easier to potentially stalk someone without them knowing. There were many other reports that also alleged that the tracking devices can be used to secretly surveil individuals.\nIn response to these reports, the tech giant updated the time period after which an AirTag that is no longer with its owner will play a sound when moved. Originally set for three days at launch, Apple changed the time period to a randomized time between 8 and 24 hours. A user’s iPhone will also display an “Item Detected Near You” message if it detects an unknown AirTag near it, which means that iOS users don’t need a separate app to locate unknown AirTags.\nHowever, since there wasn’t a way for Android users to discover nearby unknown AirTags, Apple had also announced that it planned to launch an Android app to enable users to detect an AirTag that may be traveling with them.\nDespite the concerns raised over AirTag, Apple’s support for scanning for trackers put the company ahead of the competition, which had yet to offer any such anti-stalking functionality. Following the launch, competitor Tile said it would allow anyone to use the Tile app to perform a manual scan at any time. The feature is expected to arrive in early 2022.\nApple launched AirTag earlier this year in April. They are priced at $29 each or $99 for a pack of four. The item tracking uses the company’s proprietary U1 ultra-wideband chip for what Apple calls “Precision Finding.” The device also uses Bluetooth LE (low-energy).","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"Apple has released a new Android app called 'Tracker Detect' to help people identify unexpected AirTags near them.\",\n\"Users can use the app to scan for nearby AirTags and flag them as 'unknown AirTags' if detected.\",\n\"The app is compatible with supported Find My network item trackers, including Apple's AirTag.\",\n\"The news discusses concerns about Apple's AirTag being used for potential tracking and stalking purposes.\",\n\"The app's launch is in response to these concerns, allowing Android users to detect nearby AirTags.\",\n\"Apple's support for scanning for trackers puts it ahead of the competition in anti-stalking functionality.\"\n]\n}","From":"techcrunch.com","Url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/14\/apple-releases-tracker-detect-android-app-to-help-users-discover-unknown-nearby-airtags\/","query_name":"updated_file_Unauthorized_GPS_tracking.xlsx"}

Researchers applied a machine learning algorithm to a dataset of fishing vessel activity compiled by the non-profit Global Fishing Watch, which included more than 3.7bn AIS messages from fishing vessels between 2017 and 2019.\nThey discovered geographical hotspots for ships disabling their trackers, including west Africa, the coast of Argentina and the north-west Pacific – suggesting these are locations where illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is likely to be taking place.\nIllustration: Global Fishing Watch\nIUU fishing accounts for one-fifth of global fisheries’ catches, causing up to $23.5bn (£20bn) in economic losses annually. It is the third most lucrative natural resources crime after timber and mining. It is also a big driver of marine ecosystem destruction and has been linked to human rights violations.\nIllegal fishing spurs billions in losses for developing countries, study says\nRead more\n“This is the first time intentional AIS disabling has been quantified and mapped on a global scale,” said the report’s author, Heather Welch, a spatial ecologist at University of California Santa Cruz. “Prior to this work, we didn’t have an understanding of how big a problem disabling is, where it happens, who does it and why they do it.”\nThey found that AIS disabling is a risk factor for “two nefarious behaviours: fishing in unauthorised locations and unauthorised transshipments”, said Welch, whose research was affiliated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and the Southwest Fisheries Science Center.\nTransshipment – the unloading of goods from one vessel to another – can be used to launder illegally caught seafood into the supply chain and has been linked to forced labour and human trafficking, Welch said. Transshipment and illegal fishing have an environmental cost, and damage national revenue and jobs, she added.\nAIS systems are not universally mandated, and the act of disabling an AIS device is not illegal in itself. Legal reasons for disabling include hiding a location from competitors, and sometimes pirates. But ships going dark is a “big red flag”, according to Global Fishing Watch.\nThe study results suggest that AIS disabling was highest near transshipment hotspots and the maritime boundaries of countries’ exclusive economic zones (EEZs), particularly contested ones. More than 40% of the total hours lost to suspected disabling occurred across four IUU hotspots: the north-west Pacific (13%), next to the EEZs of Argentina (16%) and west African nations (8%), and near Alaska (3%).\nSign up to Down to Earth\nFree weekly newsletter\nThe planet's most important stories.

By fraction of time lost to disabling events, Spain had the highest, followed by the US, Taiwan and China. However, Chinese fleets spend longer at sea than those of other nations.\nWelch suggested authorities could use “real-time information on disabling” for patrolling at sea, or to carry out inspections of ships in port that had switched off their AIS devices in suspicious circumstances.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": {\n\"Reason\": \"This news is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking because it discusses the intentional disabling of automatic identification systems (AIS) on fishing vessels, which is a form of unauthorized tracking device manipulation.\",\n\"Details\": \"The news highlights that up to 6% of global fishing activity involves the disabling of tracking systems, specifically AIS devices, by commercial vessels.

The message it sends to victims is there are all these technological advancements that help your stalker, but not you.”\nAmong the cheap tools that stalkers buy are bugging and GPS tracking devices, which are often disguised as common household items and are easily purchased online.\n“We see this regularly... they put in listening devices or video devices in the house or tracking devices on the car and you can buy all of that on Amazon,” said Jennifer Perry, chief executive of Digital-Trust.\nOne woman supported by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust had a listening device that looked like a USB stick placed in her handbag by her stalker so he could listen in on her conversations.\nAnother woman who was being stalked by her ex-partner began receiving texts from him with details of the bedtime stories that she told her children. He had bought an extension lead that contained a listening device and installed it in the children’s bedroom so he could listen in on conversations in the house.\nThese USB listening devices were found for sale on Amazon and eBay for less than £20. The extension lead bugs can be purchased online for between £100 and £300 and similar items – multi-plug adapters containing a listening device – are available for sale on Amazon and eBay.\nAfter the Guardian alerted eBay to the existence of the USB and plug listening devices, the items were removed and a spokesperson for eBay said: “This type of item is banned from eBay’s UK platform and any listings will be removed.” Amazon declined to comment.\nProfile\nStalking: how do I protect myself from digital surveillance?\nShow\nBetween December 2016 and November 2017, the National Stalking Helpline received 4,337 calls or emails. 77% of the victims who contacted them were female and 74% of stalkers were male. In 56% of cases the perpetrator was an ex-partner.\nIn roughly 130 cases reported to the National Stalking helpline last year, stalkers had downloaded spyware onto a victim’s computer or a covert spying app onto their phone.\nSpyware on a laptop can allow stalkers to track their victim’s keystrokes or be used to turn on the camera of a computer and watch the person through it.\n“We had one client who went home, her laptop was on, she had a shower, she then got a message from her stalker saying ‘Did you have a nice shower?’” said Elcombe Webber. “It’s that kind of invasion and not knowing how that person is able to see you. Are they outside? Are they in the house? It’s really really frightening.”\n“Installing spyware without someone’s knowledge, which is generally the gist of spyware, will normally be a misuse of the Computer Act of 1990, which is a criminal offence,” said Iain Wilson, partner at law firm Brett Wilson LLP.\nSpyware apps allow stalkers to monitor their victim’s phone use, including listening to phone calls, reading messages and emails, tracking GPS locations, viewing browsing history, photos and social media.\nThese apps are often covert and can run in the background of a phone without being open. Once installed, many of these apps can be deleted from the phone’s homepage, making them very difficult to detect.\nThese apps are often marketed as tools for parents to monitor their children’s phone activities. However, one popular app, which the Guardian has chosen not to name, markets itself as “software that can ... track your wife’s phone, anytime and from anywhere”. The app was removed from the iTunes store after Apple was contacted by the Guardian.\nIn the year to December 2016, the police recorded 4,613 stalking offences, but the National Crime Survey found that in the year to March 2015, 4.9% of women and 2.4% of men aged 16 to 59, or 1.1 million people, said they had experienced stalking, which suggests the crime is being dramatically underreported or not recorded accurately by police.\nWilson said the law has not moved quickly enough to catch up with the use of technology by stalkers and that there was a need for more police officers and CPS staff who “understand how the internet works” and can take on the work of investigating and prosecuting these crimes.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The news is about stalkers using bugging devices, tracking devices, spyware, and covert phone apps to monitor their victims.\",\n\"These devices and software enable stalkers to track victims, listen to their phone calls, and even remotely access their computer's camera.\",\n\"Tracking devices, including GPS tracking devices, are mentioned as tools used by stalkers, often disguised as common household items and easily purchased online.\",\n\"Spyware on laptops allows stalkers to monitor victims' keystrokes and even turn on their computer's camera without their knowledge.\",\n\"Covert spying apps on phones enable stalkers to track GPS locations, read messages and emails, and view browsing history, photos, and social media activities of their victims.\",\n\"The news highlights the easy availability of these surveillance tools online and mentions specific instances of their use in stalking cases.\",\n\"The article also discusses the legal aspects, stating that installing spyware without someone's knowledge is a criminal offense.\",\n\"It mentions the need for law enforcement and the legal system to catch up with the use of technology in stalking cases.\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk-news\/2018\/feb\/13\/stalkers-using-bugging-devices-and-spyware-to-monitor-victims","query_name":"updated_file_Unauthorized_GPS_tracking.xlsx"}

The feature will allow Android users to be alerted automatically if an unknown Bluetooth device is traveling with them — a sign that could point to the possibility that someone is stalking them using an Apple AirTag or other Bluetooth tracking device. Users will also be able to manually scan for trackers with their Android device and be guided through tips on what to do next if a tracking device is found.\nThe issues with Bluetooth tracking came to a head as numerous reports emerged that people had begun to use AirTags for stalking and other illegal activities, like tracking cars for a planned theft. In February 2022, Apple said it would work to address the problems created with the new devices by adding new privacy warnings and alerts, and warned would-be stalkers it was actively working with law enforcement on the AirTag-related requests it receives.\nHowever, Apple’s changes to AirTag at the time didn’t benefit Android users.\nThis May, however, Apple and Google jointly announced their intention to draft an industry-wide specification focused on how users could be alerted to unwanted tracking from Bluetooth devices. The spec is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.\nAs a result of the increased cooperation on user safety, Google said at I\/O in May it would introduce a series of improvements to its own Find My Device network as well as proactive alerts about trackers traveling with you, which would include support for Apple’s AirTag and other devices. We understand this is a custom implementation to protect Android users, ahead of the finalized joint spec. Apple, however, will wait to implement the joint spec but will not roll out its own custom implementation in the meantime.\nAs this new alerts feature now rolls out, Android users will receive a notification on their device if an unknown tracker is separated from its owner and is determined to be with you. Users will then be able to tap on the notification to view a map of where the tracker was seen traveling with you.\nYou’ll also be able to tap on “Play Sound” to have the tracker make a noise, allowing you to locate the device.\nImage Credits: Google\nIf the device is found, users can bring it near the back of their phone to get more information. Some devices will share their serial number or additional information about the owner, like the last four digits of their phone number when held near the phone.\nYou’ll also be presented with tips on how to disable the Bluetooth device completely so the owner can no longer track you and receive future updates from the tracker.\nIn addition, another feature will allow users to manually scan their surroundings if they’re worried a Bluetooth tracker may be nearby. This manual scan can be kicked off by visiting Android’s Settings, then “Safety & Emergency” and then choosing the option “Unknown tracker alerts” and tapping on the “Scan Now” button. The device will take about 10 seconds to complete the manual scan and will provide tips on what to do next if a tracker is found. This way, users don’t have to wait for an automatic alert.\nImage Credits: Google\nAlso announced at I\/O 2023, Google said it would update its Find My Device network to help users locate other missing belongings, like headphones, phones and everyday items, like luggage and keys, which can be located by third-party Bluetooth tracker tags. It explained users would be able to locate devices by ringing them or viewing their location on a map — even if they’re offline, adding that it would support trackers from Tile, Chipolo and Pebblebee, as well as audio devices like Pixel Buds and headphones from Sony and JBL.\nToday, however, Google says this update is on hold.\nThe decision was made to wait to roll out these updates because Google is now working in partnership with Apple to finalize the joint unwanted tracker alert specification by year-end.\n“At this time we’ve made the decision to hold the rollout of the Find My Device network until Apple has implemented protections for iOS,” Google says.\nGoogle updates Find My Device network, adds new feature to warn about unknown AirTags with you","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking because it discusses a new safety feature for Android users that alerts them if an unknown Bluetooth device is traveling with them.

{"num":7,"Time":"Wed 9 Sep 2020 11.15 CEST","Title":"Illegal devices that bypass vehicle emissions controls spread across US","Content":"W\nhen officials at the Environmental Protection Agency began investigating Freedom Performance, LLC, they didn’t have to look very hard for evidence that the company was violating the Clean Air Act. According to legal documents, the Florida car parts distributor literally advertised violations on its website.\n“The road to hell is often paved with good intentions,” stated one ad for a kit to remove federally required emissions controls from diesel trucks. It identified a particular emissions control system that “is certainly noble in its intent” but “in reality it is putting your engine through hell … The best solution is deletion.”\nAccording to the EPA, Freedom Performance was advertising defeat devices –hardware and software that bypasses or eliminates emission controls. The Clean Air Act forbids tampering with these controls, and violations carry heavy fines. But defeat devices – also known as “delete devices” – are popular with many vehicle owners.\nShops advertise that “delete kits” will improve mileage and extend the lifespan of expensive components, saving customers thousands of dollars. In recent years, a lucrative cottage industry of defeat devices has exploded across the US as repair shops, online retailers and manufacturers feed, and generate, consumer demand.\nThe EPA estimates that more than 500,000 diesel pickup trucks have been “deleted” since 2009. The EPA claims that these illegally modified vehicles produced hundreds of thousands of tons of excess nitrogen oxide – the equivalent of adding 9m more trucks to the road. Public health advocates say diesel emissions contribute to increases in fine particulate matter and other airborne pollutants that have been linked to higher rates of cancer, heart attacks, strokes and neurodegenerative diseases.\nIn recent years, the EPA has escalated a crackdown, resolving more than 60 cases against companies that make or distribute defeat devices since 2017. The penalties can be stiff: in February, the agency announced that Freedom Performance would pay more than $7m for committing thousands of violations. A managing member of the company, Geoffrey Kemper, did not respond to a request for comment.\nBut the crackdown has left much unresolved.\nFor one, defeat devices can be easily found for sale in brick-and-mortar stores around the country and online. That has led some public health advocates to launch their own litigation under the Clean Air Act. They have targeted body shops featured on the popular Discovery Channel show Diesel Brothers, where some mechanics have customized huge diesel trucks with names like BroDozer and Truck Norris.\nEnforcement of the defeat device law has triggered pushback from body shops and retailers who say the law is confusing and draconian. The industry is backing a bill in Congress written by lawmakers calling themselves the Motorsports Caucus. The bill claims it would protect the right of motorists to convert a highway vehicle into a race car, but that, opponents say, would hamper EPA enforcement of clean air standards.\n‘Brodozer’, a customized truck with deleted emissions controls, was featured in the Discovery Channel’s show the Diesel Brothers. Photograph: Photo courtesy of the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment\nDelete kits\nOnce upon a time, turning off the emissions controls in a vehicle was almost as simple as flipping a switch, according to the EPA. But as the agency imposed tighter emissions standards, automakers introduced increasingly sophisticated equipment to reduce pollutants.\nNowadays, defeat devices generally come in “delete kits” with hardware and software to use in tandem. “Tuners”, which plug into a vehicle, install software known as “tunes” that changes how a vehicle’s computer regulates emission levels. Physical devices can be installed in a vehicle’s engine or exhaust system; they include “delete pipes”, hollow tubes that bypass or replace equipment containing sensitive filters.\nThough aftermarket defeat devices have always been illegal, the EPA significantly ramped up enforcement around the time of the most notorious automotive industry fraud of the 21st century: the Volkswagen scandal.\nIn 2013 and 2014, the California government’s air resources board and researchers at West Virginia University discovered that the German automaker had installed a defeat mechanism across its fleet of diesel-engine passenger vehicles. It could detect when the cars were being tested, bringing emissions levels down to regulatory standards.\nOn the road, however, the vehicles emitted up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides – reactive, poisonous gases – than during the tests. Nearly 600,000 of these vehicles were sold or for sale in the US, and the company later admitted it had manufactured about 11m globally.\nHow SUVs conquered the world – at the expense of its climate\nRead more\nThe result was a legal settlement that has cost Volkswagen more than $20bn in the US alone, including criminal and civil penalties and investments in emission reduction projects around the country.\n“Few companies could survive that litigation,” said John Cruden, assistant attorney general for environment at the time and lead negotiator on the Volkswagen case. “So obviously it has an exceptional deterrent effect.”\nThe ripples have reached smaller operators in the aftermarket parts industry, which makes and installs defeat devices after vehicles are on the road. They range from subsidiaries of major companies such as Polaris Inc to local garages tampering with controls on a few dozen semi trucks.\nOne of the first companies to catch the EPA’s attention was H&S Performance.\nA lab test in Colorado revealed that this modified truck shown on Diesel Brothers emitted 30 to 40 times the limit for various pollutants. A straight pipe can be seen in the foreground. Photograph: Photo courtesy of the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment\nIn 2015, the EPA announced that the Utah manufacturer had agreed to pay a $1m fine for making and selling tens of thousands of defeat devices. According to the consent agreement, the EPA estimated that the H&S tuners had created an additional 71,669 tons of nitrogen oxides. The agency claimed that H&S had committed more than 114,000 violations of the Clean Air Act – one violation for each time H&S sold a defeat device.\nOver the next five years, the EPA took aim at companies that had manufactured hundreds of thousands of defeat devices. For example, in September 2018, the agency settled a case with a Florida firm called Derive Systems, which allegedly manufactured and sold approximately 363,000 parts.\nDespite these actions, many companies continue to operate with impunity. The clearest evidence is the sheer number of tuners and straight pipes that appear to be openly sold on e-commerce sites, including eBay, and by users on Facebook’s Marketplace platform.\n“All you’ve got to do is Google DPF tuner online and you’ll have a hundred places you can buy it today,” David Sparks, a mechanic who has featured on Diesel Brothers, said in a deposition in a court case.\nWhile most sites don’t openly claim that their products bypass emissions controls, eBay vendors sell “delete kits” that do make this boast, despite an eBay policy that forbids the sale of defeat devices. An eBay representative told FairWarning the company would remove the illegal listings, but a search for “delete kits” nearly five weeks later still turned up numerous items for sale.\nThere is also at least one listing for a “delete kit” on Facebook’s Marketplace platform that remains active days after FairWarning notified the company. Facebook puts the legal onus on Marketplace buyers and sellers, a spokesperson told FairWarning, and only investigates listings when asked by regulators or law enforcement.\nLawsuits\nDiscouraged by what they see as the EPA’s limited results, public health advocates in Utah are pursuing a novel strategy to eliminate defeat devices.\nIn 2017, Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment filed what the group claims was the first Clean Air Act citizen suit against companies selling defeat devices. The law allows private citizens to file lawsuits to enforce emissions standards. Their targets included body shops featured on Diesel Brothers.\nCounty health department data showed that many diesel trucks were failing emissions tests due to deliberate tampering with pollutant controls, and that a deleted diesel typically produced 36 times more nitrogen oxides than allowed by the EPA.\nReed Zars, the attorney who filed the suit, only had to look as far as Instagram and Facebook to find potential violations by some of the companies featured on the TV show.\nZars bought one of the trucks that had appeared on the show and took it to an EPA-certified lab in Colorado for emissions testing. The lab discovered that the modified truck emitted 30 to 40 times the limit for various pollutants.\nThe Discovery Channel declined to comment.\n‘Hercules’, a truck with deleted emissions controls that was featured on Diesel Brothers. Photograph: Photo courtesy of the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment\nDavid Sparks, a body shop owner featured on Diesel Brothers and one of the defendants in the lawsuit, did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn March, a court ruled in favor of the physicians’ group, imposing over $850,000 in fines and penalties and forbidding the defendants from selling defeat devices.\nLast September, the Utah advocacy group went after a bigger target: Tap Worldwide, an aftermarket parts company with dozens of brick-and-mortar outlets across the US. Tap is a subsidiary of Polaris Inc.\nAccording to the suit, Tap has repeatedly violated the Clean Air Act by selling and installing defeat devices. The company, which has asked the court to dismiss the case, did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn California, the industry is well aware of state rules that are more stringent than the EPA’s, said Stanley Young, spokesman for the California air resources board.\n“By now everybody knows how strict California is and anybody who tries to sell unauthorized aftermarket parts in California typically knows that they’re doing it illegally and they have to do it kind of on the down-low,” Young said.\nThe EPA said it had made more than two dozen educational presentations to various industry groups since fall 2019.\nBut players in the industry and their supporters in Congress continue to promote the idea that the EPA is targeting people who transform their vehicles solely for racing.\nThe climate crisis has already arrived. Just look to California’s abnormal wildfires\nAlastair Gee\nRead more\nIn October 2019, Congress’s “Motorsports Caucus” introduced a bill to protect the right of motorists to convert their vehicles into race cars – the latest version of legislation that has previously failed.\nAccording to public records, the Specialty Equipment Market Association has lobbied for years for Congress to pass such a bill, branding it a commonsense correction to EPA overreach.\nThe EPA stated in an email that it had no interest in cracking down on those who manufacture, sell or install parts that transform street-legal vehicles into race-cars only operated on a track. What is illegal, according to the EPA, is modifying emissions controls in vehicles that will be used on streets and highways.\nThe bill’s opponents believe that rather than clarifying the EPA’s scope, it would make enforcement more difficult. The Congressional Budget Office anticipated that the bill would probably force the EPA to shift its focus from manufacturers and sellers to vehicle users.\nIn the aftermath of the Volkswagen scandal, regulators are devising new ways to catch potential defeat device violations at every level.\nThe California air resources board, for instance, is testing ways to identify trucks exceeding emissions standards even when they’re on the road, Young said.\nHi-tech solutions may become an effective form of deterrence. For now, though, many companies are still willing to test the law. On 23 July, the EPA announced that it had busted an Irvine, California, company for manufacturing and distributing defeat devices.\nThis story was produced by FairWarning, a non-profit news organization based in southern California that focuses on public health, consumer, labor and environmental issues.

REUTERS\/Larry Downing\nThe high court ruling was a defeat for the Obama administration, which had argued that a warrant was not required to use global positioning system devices to monitor a vehicle on public streets.\nThe justices unanimously upheld a precedent-setting ruling by a U.S. appeals court that the police must first obtain a warrant to use a GPS device for an extended period of time to covertly follow a suspect.\nThe high court ruled that placement of a device on a vehicle and using it to monitor the vehicle’s movements was covered by U.S. constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures of evidence.\nThere are no precise statistics on how often police in the United States use GPS tracking in criminal investigations. But the Obama administration told the court last year it was used sparingly by federal law enforcement officials.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union rights group hailed the ruling as an important victory for privacy. “While this case turned on the fact that the government physically placed a GPS device on the defendant’s car, the implications are much broader,” Steven Shapiro of the ACLU said.\n“A majority of the court acknowledged that advancing technology, like cell phone tracking, gives the government unprecedented ability to collect, store, and analyze an enormous amount of information about our private lives,” he said.\nSUSPECTED DRUG TRAFFICKER\nThe case began in 2005 when police officers went to a public parking lot in Maryland and secretly installed a GPS device on a Jeep Grand Cherokee used by a Washington, D.C. nightclub owner, Antoine Jones.\nJones was suspected of drug trafficking and the police tracked his movements for a month. The resulting evidence played a key role in his conviction for conspiring to distribute cocaine.\nThe appeals court had thrown out Jones’s conviction and his\nlife-in-prison sentence, and ruled prolonged electronic monitoring of the vehicle amounted to a search.\nAll nine justices agreed in upholding the appeals court decision, but at least four justices would have gone even further in finding fault not only with the attachment of the device, but also with the lengthy monitoring.\nIn summarizing the court’s majority opinion from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia said attachment of the device by the police was a trespass and an improper intrusion of the kind that would have been considered a search when the Constitution was adopted some 220 years ago.\nThe administration argued that even if it were a search, it was lawful and reasonable under the Constitution. Scalia said his opinion did not decide that issue and some more difficult problems that may emerge in a future case, such as a six-month monitoring of a suspected terrorist.\nJoining Scalia’s opinion were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor.\nSotomayor wrote separately to say the case raised difficult questions about individual privacy expectations in a digital age, but said the case could be decided on narrower grounds over the physical intrusion in attaching the device.\nLONG-TERM MONITORING\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote a separate opinion that Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan joined. He wrote that he would have decided the case by holding that Jones’s reasonable privacy expectations were violated by long-term monitoring of his vehicle’s movements.\nAlito said in recent years many new devices have emerged that track a person’s movements, including video surveillance in some cities, automatic toll collection systems on roads, devices on cars that disclose their location, cell phones and other wireless devices.\n“The availability and use of these and other new devices will continue to shape the average person’s expectations about the privacy of his or her daily movements,” he wrote.\nOne law professor said those four justices were clearly concerned about the potential impact of new technologies and believed extended monitoring likely required a warrant so law enforcement should “be on the safe side and get a warrant.”\n“This is an indication that there are justices who are recognizing that privacy norms are shifting but the fact that people’s lives take place increasingly online does not mean that society has decided that there’s no such thing as privacy anymore,” said Joel Reidenberg, a law professor at Fordham University in New York.\nThe Supreme Court case is United States v.

Swarm Technologies, still in stealth mode, appears to have gone ahead with the deployment of four satellites deemed too small to be tracked and therefore unsafe to put into orbit.\nIEEE Spectrum put the pieces together from public FCC documents and some launch manifests. Swarm’s original plan was to put several very small satellites — smaller even than 1U Cubesats — in orbit to test its experimental communications system.\nBut the small size meant the satellites couldn’t be tracked with existing space monitoring technology, and the FCC, which must approve communications satellite launches, considered this too great a risk and declined to authorize Swarm’s proposed deployment.\nWhat should have happened next is: Swarm scrubs the deployment, applies again with larger satellites or some other means of improving the small ones’ visibility, the FCC grants permission and then the launch happens.\nWhile the company did reapply with larger satellites, it seems to have gone ahead with the original plan of launching the tiny satellites despite the FCC’s warning not to. This is evident from the manifest of India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PDF) that took off in January, which included four “SpaceBEEs” matching the description of Swarm’s unauthorized craft.\nIt’s possible that Swarm’s satellites were already locked and loaded, and perhaps more importantly, paid for, by the time the FCC issued their decision in December. The long lead times for both approval and launch mean that much prep must be done while a deployment is still waiting for the official go-ahead — if you waited for the red tape to clear before even applying for a launch spot, you might run out of funding just waiting for your chance to get into orbit.\nBut in this case, especially as the FCC cited a safety issue — the inability to reliably track the satellites’ location — the correct thing to do would be to pull out of the launch. That’s easy for me to say, of course, it’s not my money or company, but skirting the rules like this may prove more costly in the end than adhering to them.\nI’ve asked Swarm, the FCC and Spaceflight (which appears to have arranged Swarm’s space on the launch, perhaps thinking authorization was forthcoming) for comment and will update this story if I hear back.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about Unauthorized GPS tracking as it involves a space startup called Swarm Technologies that launched four satellites despite the FCC's warning not to do so.

The aggressive move is a response to growing privacy concerns surrounding devices aimed at minors.\n“Via an app, parents can use such children’s watches to listen unnoticed to the child’s environment and they are to be regarded as an unauthorized transmitting system,” the agency’s president Jochen Homann said in a statement provided to the BBC.

{"num":19,"Time":"DECEMBER 29, 2022","Title":"SPECIAL REPORT-Lawyers exit Hong Kong as they face campaign of intimidation","Content":"By James Pomfret, Greg Torode, Anne Marie Roantree, David Lague\nHONG KONG, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Anonymous threats sent by text message and email. GPS tracking devices placed under a car, and Chinese “funeral money” sent to an office. Ambushes by reporters working for state-controlled media. Accusations of disloyalty in the press.\nThese are some of the methods deployed in a campaign of intimidation being waged against lawyers in Hong Kong who take on human rights cases, have criticized a China-imposed national security law or raised alarms about threats to the rule of law. While some of Hong Kong’s leading rights lawyers have been detained in the past two-and-a-half years, many others have become the target of a more insidious effort to cleanse the city of dissent – part of a wider crackdown by the ruling Communist Party on lawyers across China, say activists, legal scholars and diplomats.\nMichael Vidler, one of the city’s top human rights lawyers, is among them. Vidler left Hong Kong in April, a couple of months after a judge named his law firm six times in a ruling that convicted four pro-democracy protesters on charges of illegal assembly and possession of unauthorized weapons. Vidler interpreted the judgment as “a call to action” on the city’s national security police “to investigate me,” he told Reuters in an interview last month in Europe. He asked that his location not be disclosed.\nThe event that precipitated his hasty departure, Vidler said, was the appearance of articles in the state-backed media in Hong Kong about him. One said he was the representative of an “anti-China” group. Within days, the British national left his home of three decades.\nVidler tried to make an inconspicuous exit. He sent a suitcase to a friend before flying out. On the day of departure, he met the friend with the suitcase and went to the airport. But on arriving, reporters from state-backed media outlets were waiting.\nThey “descended on me as a mob at the check-in counter, taking photos of my travel documents,” Vidler said. His last-minute flight plans were known only to his wife, the airline and immigration authorities, he said, which “clearly shows that this information was provided by official sources” to the media.\n“This was in my view state-sponsored intimidation and harassment,” said Vidler, whose wife and children later left Hong Kong. A government spokesman called Vidler’s characterization of events “baseless and erroneous.”\nOther high-profile departures include former Bar Association chairman Paul Harris. He left his home of decades for England hours after being called in for questioning by national security police. Harris, too, was hounded by reporters from state-backed outlets at the airport as he departed.\nThe intimidation is having a broad chilling effect, as less prominent lawyers also flee the city. A major catalyst is Hong Kong’s national security law, which was imposed in June 2020, after a wave of anti-government protests shook the city the previous year. The law includes life sentences for vaguely worded offenses such as subversion, secession and collusion with foreign forces. Facing or fearing prosecution under the law, or concerned about threats to Hong Kong’s freedoms, many lawyers and legal academics have quietly departed, mostly to Britain, Australia and North America.\nOne Hong Kong solicitor who has relocated to England told Reuters that she knew of at least 80 Hong Kong lawyers who had moved to Britain since the security law was imposed in June 2020. Another lawyer, now living in Australia, estimated that several dozen Hong Kong lawyers had moved there.\nSome are preparing for the possibility they may never return. Kevin Yam, a commercial solicitor and now vocal critic of Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong, said he took his mother’s ashes with him when he departed for Melbourne in April. “I wanted to be fully prepared, given the way Hong Kong is going,” Yam said. “If I couldn’t ever get back to Hong Kong, I didn’t want to leave her there.”\nSPREAD TO HONG KONG\nSince Chinese leader Xi Jinping came to power a decade ago, the ruling Communist Party has intensified its persecution of human rights lawyers and legal activists on the mainland. Prominent rights lawyers there, including Ding Jiaxi and Xu Zhiyong, are among hundreds who have been detained, harassed and jailed.\nThis suppression spread to Hong Kong in the aftermath of the city’s sometimes violent anti-government protests in the second half of 2019. Martin Lee, Margaret Ng and Chow Hang-tung are among the veteran human rights lawyers who have been arrested.\nCity leaders deny that a purge of the profession is under way.\n“There is no truth in the alleged harassment or intimidation of ‘human rights’ lawyers” by the government, the Hong Kong Chief Executive’s Office said in response to questions from Reuters. “We dispute and strongly object to your highly suggestive questions and biased, baseless and false accusations against the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL) and law enforcement actions taken by law enforcement agencies.”\nIn the case of Vidler, the Chief Executive’s Office said, the judge had not suggested “that a lawyer could be guilty of a criminal offense by providing legal services.”\nAny actions by law enforcement were “strictly in accordance with the law” and had nothing to do with a person’s “political stance, background or occupation,” the office said.\nAsked about Vidler’s alarm over the ruling that cited his law firm, the Judiciary said it “does not comment on court judgments” and that judges do not “make public comments on their judgments.” Any suggestion of “inappropriate conduct” by a judge, it said, could only be made “when supported by solid grounds and evidence. Surmise and innuendo fall far short of what is required.”\nIn Beijing, the State Council Information Office and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not respond to questions from Reuters.\nFor this article, Reuters interviewed more than 50 lawyers and legal academics in Hong Kong and abroad.\nHong Kong’s lawyers have been a thorn in Beijing’s side since the former colony’s handover from the British in 1997. As a profession, lawyers have taken to the streets in six silent marches since the handover, in protest at what they perceived as threats to the city’s legal system and freedoms. Lawyers were also prominent figures in the mass public demonstrations against proposed national security laws in 2003, the pro-democracy Occupy Central protest movement in 2014 that paralyzed parts of the city, and the rallies in 2019 following the government’s bid to introduce laws allowing the extradition of criminal suspects for trial on the mainland.\nHOSTILE COVERAGE\nA key target in the campaign of intimidation has been the two legal professional bodies that represent and regulate Hong Kong’s legal fraternity – the Law Society and the Bar Association. Mainland officials have long sought influence over these two influential bodies, according to senior Hong Kong lawyers.\nUnlike China or the United States, Hong Kong has a British-style split legal system, in which barristers serve as advocates in courts and solicitors deal directly with clients. When necessary, solicitors hire barristers to represent clients in court or provide specialist legal advice.\nThe Law Society represents the city’s solicitors and has more than 13,000 members. The Bar Association represents Hong Kong’s 1,600 barristers. By law, the two bodies regulate their professions, with the power to qualify barristers and solicitors. By convention, both recommend who represents the professions on the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission, a panel that appoints and promotes judges.\nFor several weeks last year, a hotly contested election for the Law Society’s governing council became the arena in which the intimidation campaign played out. The target: a group of four candidates, the so-called “liberals,” who believed the Law Society should take a stand on issues including freedom of speech, judicial independence and the rule of law. They were opposed by a group of candidates, the so-called “professionals,” who believed the body should focus more narrowly on its role in regulating solicitors while expanding business ties with the mainland.\nThe “liberals” already held seven seats on the 20-member council. If they prevailed among the city’s solicitors, they would be in the majority.\nA barrage of hostile coverage by pro-Beijing media outlets in Hong Kong and official pressure was unleashed on the liberal group.\nIn the days leading up to the August election, the Hong Kong leader at the time, Carrie Lam, issued a warning at a news conference: If the Law Society got involved in politics, the government would consider cutting ties with the body. The threat implied that the Law Society would lose its role as part of the administration of justice in the city, multiple lawyers in the city told Reuters. The People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, called on the Law Society not to become a “politicized group.”\nIn the weeks ahead of the election, Reuters tallied more than 30 articles and editorials attacking the liberal candidates in pro-Beijing media outlets in Hong Kong. They were accused of being “independence advocates” for Hong Kong and having “ulterior political goals.”\nAt the same time, at least one member of the liberal group was receiving anonymous threats. Three days before the election, Jonathan Ross, a commercial lawyer, announced publicly he was pulling out of the race, citing personal risks. Ross told Reuters he had received anonymous threats via WhatsApp.\nHenry Wheare, a solicitor specializing in intellectual property law who was one of the liberal candidates, said he didn’t receive any threats but that the media allegations leveled at him and the other liberals were a “complete lie.” Another member of the group, Denis Brock, a commercial lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment.\nIt is unclear if the pressure swayed the city’s solicitors, but on August 24, the liberal ticket was soundly defeated. All five lawyers in the professionals group were elected, giving them a clear majority on the council.\nLaw Society President C.M. Chan said all elections for the body’s governing council, including the 2021 election, were conducted “in a fair and transparent manner.” The Law Society, he said in response to questions from Reuters, “has spoken up in the past and will continue to speak up in future to defend the rule of law and to uphold the integrity and independence of our judiciary.”\nHASTY DEPARTURE\nThe Bar Association, which traditionally has been more outspoken on rule-of-law issues, faced even more intense criticism by Chinese officials and the state-controlled media. One target of the pressure was Harris, its chairman and a veteran human rights lawyer.\nBefore he became head of the Bar, Harris had been vocal on social media. “China’s determination to crush Hong Kong is a sign of weakness, not strength,” he tweeted a month before the National Security Law was imposed. “The regime knows it is illegitimate and unpopular and the contagion of criticism is spreading. But being weak is likely to make it even more cruel than before, if that is possible.”\nAfter the law was imposed, Harris tweeted again on July 1: “I, a Hong Kong permanent resident and British citizen, can now be seized in the street by Mainland agents, taken to the Mainland and never heard of again, with no legal redress.”\nAfter becoming Bar chairman in January 2021, Harris was more restrained in his criticism of the authorities. But shortly after he was elected, he held a press conference where he made relatively restrained criticism of the national security law. He said he hoped to “explore” if there was any chance the government would agree to some “modifications” that would make the law consistent with Hong Kong’s existing laws and legal protections.\nBeijing unleashed a barrage of criticism. China’s top representative body in Hong Kong, the liaison office, accused Harris of unprofessional conduct, personal arrogance and ignorance. The office said the security law could not be challenged.\nIn April last year, then-city Chief Executive Lam threatened to intervene in the Bar Association if there were “instances or complaints about the Bar not acting in accordance with Hong Kong’s law.” In August, the People’s Daily described the Bar as a “running rat.”\nUnder sustained criticism, Harris didn’t seek a second term as Bar chairman when his term ended in January this year. Nevertheless, a few months later, on March 1, he was summoned to a police station and interviewed by national security police. Within hours of his interrogation, Harris left Hong Kong for England, where he now resides. Photographers and reporters from pro-Beijing newspapers were waiting for him when he arrived at Hong Kong airport that evening. One of the outlets published a video of his departure.\nThe Bar Association did not respond to questions from Reuters.\nAsked about the campaign of intimidation against lawyers, including the cases of Vidler and Harris, the Hong Kong police said the department did “not comment on individual cases.” Carrie Lam and the liaison office did not respond to requests for comment.\nTRACKING DEVICES\nHarris’s exit was a clear message to his fellow barristers, said Eric Lai, a legal academic who left Hong Kong in 2020. “It shows that if you openly disagree with the authorities, you will be harassed, not just by the media, but also by the authorities,” said Lai, now a non-resident fellow at the Georgetown Center for Asian Law in Washington, D.C.\nThe pressure has worked. Once ready to challenge the authorities on legal issues, the Bar Association has fallen silent on the national security law’s radical reshaping of Hong Kong’s legal and political system, according to lawyers and human rights campaigners. The association said nothing about the circumstances of Harris’ departure.\nA review of press releases published on the Bar Association website shows that since January this year, the Bar has made no critical comments on the national security law. The law has been widely condemned by international legal bodies and rights groups including the United Nations Human Rights Committee.\n“The Bar Association used to be critical of government actions, issuing statements on legal reforms and other legal issues,” said longtime Hong Kong human rights activist Patrick Poon, now a visiting researcher at the Institute of Comparative Law at Meiji University in Tokyo. “Nowadays you don’t see those statements any longer,” said Poon, who left Hong Kong after the security law was introduced.\nLawyers who served in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council have also been targeted.\nBarrister and former lawmaker Dennis Kwok told Reuters he received threats before abruptly departing Hong Kong in November 2020. He said he is now working at a boutique law firm he set up in New York and is a senior research fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School.\nA prominent pro-democracy activist, Kwok was hit with sustained criticism from mainland authorities and pro-Beijing figures for his role in employing a filibuster to paralyze the city’s Legislative Council and block legislation opposed by pro-democracy lawmakers. He was also denounced for meeting top U.S. officials and lawmakers on a visit to Washington in early 2019.\nIn mid-2020, Kwok found GPS tracking devices under his car “twice in one week,” he said. He provided Reuters with a picture of one of the devices – a small, black rectangular case containing a SIM card to relay positioning data to another device.\nThreats were delivered to his office, he said. On one occasion, Chinese “funeral money,” fake paper money sometimes burned by the graveside in a folk tradition, was sent to his office with a note, Kwok recalled. “‘You will be needing these very soon,’ the note read,” he said.\nIn November 2020, Kwok and three other pro-democracy lawmakers were ousted from the Legislative Council after China’s parliament ruled that sitting members could be disqualified if deemed a threat to national security. That month, Kwok quietly slipped out of Hong Kong. He said articles in the pro-Beijing press, calling for his arrest and accusing him of being a foreign agent, also spurred him to leave.\n“After they disqualified me,” he said of the Chinese parliament’s move to oust him, “it was very clear the writing was on the wall.”\nReporting by James Pomfret, Greg Torode, Anne Marie Roantree and David Lague.

(AP) — NASCAR has fined an Xfinity Series team $50,000 because driver Alex Labbe violated the testing policy for the road course at Daytona International Speedway.\nNASCAR will race on that configuration for the first time later this month and is not holding any practice sessions before the events. The sanctioning body has said drivers may participate in only one race that weekend in an effort to prevent competitors from gaining experience on the course.\nIn an attempted workaround of the rules, Labbe went to an SCCA event last weekend at Daytona to try to learn the circuit. NASCAR officials caught wind of his presence and ordered Labbe off the track.\nNASCAR viewed Labbe being on track as an illegal test because of the car used. The Xfinity rule book states: “Private vehicle testing by any race team, employee, contractor, affiliate, associate, subsidiary, or surrogate is strictly prohibited.” Another section states: “NASCAR, in its sole discretion, will determine in advance what constitutes an authorized test. In general, only tests conducted under the NASCAR National Series Unified Testing policy are considered to be authorized tests.”\nLabbe at the test was listed in Regional Race Group 7 in a 2019 Chevrolet Camaro. The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro is the approved model for Chevy teams in the Xfinity Series.\nTeam owner Mario Gosselin was fined $50,000 and docked 75 points in team owner standings for violating the private test policy. Labbe also was docked 75 points in driver standings — he already was 73 points out of the 12th and final playoff spot before the penalty and is now 148 points out.\nVery few current NASCAR drivers have ever raced on Daytona’s road course, with their only previous chances coming in IMSA’s Rolex 24 endurance race.

Another similar complaint (Mitchell v. Meta Platforms Inc.) was filed last week.\nThe plaintiffs allege that Meta follows users’ online activity by funneling them into the web browser built into Facebook and injecting JavaScript into the sites they visit. That code makes it possible for the company to monitor “every single interaction with external websites,” including where they tap, and what passwords and other text they enter:\nNow, even when users do not consent to being tracked, Meta tracks Facebook users’ online activity and communications with external third-party websites by injecting JavaScript code into those sites. When users click on a link within the Facebook app, Meta automatically directs them to the in-app browser it is monitoring instead of the smartphone’s default browser, without telling users that this is happening or they are being tracked.\nApple introduced iOS 14.5 in April of last year, striking a massive blow to social media companies like Meta that relied on tracking users’ behavior for advertising purposes. The company cited the iOS changes specifically in its earning calls as it prepped investors to adjust to the new normal for its ad targeting business, describing Apple’s privacy changes as a “headwind” that it would need to overcome.\nIn a statement emailed to TechCrunch, a Meta spokesperson said the allegations were “without merit” and that the company would defend itself “vigorously.” “We have carefully designed our in-app browser to respect users’ privacy choices, including how data may be used for ads,” the spokesperson said.\nApple’s App Tracking Transparency feature has arrived — here’s what you need to know\nIn the new iOS privacy prompt, Apple asks if a user consents to have their activity tracked “across other companies’ apps and websites.” Users who opt out might reasonably believe that they are on an external web browser when opening links within Facebook or Instagram, though the company would likely argue the opposite.\nSecurity researcher Felix Krause surfaced concerns around Facebook and Instagram’s in-app browsers last month and the lawsuit draws heavily from his report. He urged Meta to send users to Safari or another external browser to close up the loophole.\n“Do what Meta is already doing with WhatsApp: Stop modifying third party websites, and use Safari or SFSafariViewController for all third party websites,” Krause wrote in a blog post. “It’s what’s best for the user, and the right thing to do.”\n Snap says iOS privacy changes hit its ad business harder than expected\nFacebook warns of ‘headwinds’ to its ad business from regulators and Apple","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking because it discusses allegations that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has been tracking users' online activity and communications with external third-party websites without their consent.

The company, Swarm Technologies, now faces a $900,000 penalty from the agency, as well as extra oversight of its continuing operations.\nSwarm’s SpaceBEEs are the beginning of a planned constellation of small satellites with which the company intends to provide low-cost global connectivity.\nUnfortunately, the units are so small — about a quarter the size of a standard cubesat, which is already quite tiny — that the FCC felt they would be too difficult to track, and did not approve the launch.\nSpaceBEEs are small, as you can see. Credit: Swarm Technologies\nSwarm, perhaps thinking it better to ask forgiveness than file the paperwork for permission, launched anyway in January aboard India’s PSLV-C40, which carried more than a dozen other passengers to space as well. (I asked Swarm and the launch provider, Spaceflight, at the time for comment but never heard back.)\nThe FCC obviously didn’t like this, and began an investigation shortly afterwards. According to an FCC press release:\nThe investigation found that Swarm had launched the four BEEs using an unaffiliated launch company in India and had unlawfully transmitted signals between earth stations in Georgia and the satellites for over a week. In addition, during the course of its investigation, the FCC discovered that Swarm had also performed unauthorized weather balloon-to-ground station tests and other unauthorized equipment tests prior to the small satellites launch. All these activities require FCC authorization and the company had not received such authorization before the activities occurred.\nNot good! As penance, Swarm Technologies will have to pay the aforementioned $900,000, and now has to submit pre-launch reports to the FCC within five days of signing an agreement to launch, and at least 45 days before takeoff.\nThe company hasn’t been sitting on its hands this whole time. The unauthorized launch was a mistake to be sure, but it has continued its pursuit of a global constellation and launched three more SpaceBEEs into orbit just a few weeks ago aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9.\nSwarm has worked to put the concerns about tracking to bed; in fact, the company claims its devices are more trackable than ordinary cubesats, with a larger radar cross section and extra reflectivity thanks to a Van Atta array (ask them). SpaceBEE-1 is about to pass over Italy as I write this — you can check its location live here.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking.

Wells Fargo originally agreed to pay $110 million covering accounts since 2009, but boosted the payout after discovering more problems.\nKeller Rohrback said the settlement “fairly balances the risks” of further litigation, including the possibility their clients might lose, against the benefits.\nThe accord has drawn objections from law firms including Heninger Garrison Davis, from Birmingham, Alabama.\nIt said the accord underestimated the potential maximum damages by at least 50 percent, and did not properly address whether Wells Fargo committed identity theft by using customers’ personal data to open the accounts.\nLawyers from the Alabama firm did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.

The app is also specifically designed to stay hidden on a phone’s home screen, making it difficult to detect and remove. Also known as stalkerware or spouseware, these kinds of phone monitoring apps are often planted by someone — such as spouses or domestic partners — with physical access to a person’s phone, without their consent or knowledge.\nOnce planted, LetMeSpy silently uploads the phone’s text messages, call logs and precise location data to its servers, allowing the person who planted the app to track the person in real time.\nFor their deep level of access to a person’s phone, these surveillance apps are notoriously buggy and known for rudimentary security mistakes, with countless spyware apps over the years getting hacked, or leaking and exposing the private phone data stolen from unwitting victims.\nLetMeSpy is not much different.\nPolish security research blog Niebezpiecznik first reported the breach. When Niebezpiecznik contacted the spyware maker for comment, the hacker reportedly responded instead, claiming to have seized wide access to the spyware maker’s domain.\nIt’s not clear who is behind the LetMeSpy hack or their motives. The hacker intimated that they deleted LetMeSpy’s databases stored on the server. A copy of the hacked database also appeared online later the same day.\nDDoSecrets, a nonprofit transparency collective that indexes leaked datasets in the public interest, obtained a copy of the hacked LetMeSpy data and shared it with TechCrunch. DDoSecrets said it was limiting the distribution of the data to journalists and researchers, given the amount of personally identifiable information in the cache.\nTechCrunch reviewed the leaked data, which included years of victims’ call logs and text messages dating back to 2013.\nThe database we reviewed contained current records on at least 13,000 compromised devices, though some of the devices shared little to no data with LetMeSpy. (LetMeSpy claims to delete data after two months of account inactivity.)\nIn January, LetMeSpy’s website said its spyware was used to track over 236,000 devices and collected tens of millions of call logs, text messages and location data points to date. At the time of writing, the site’s counters read as zero. Much of the site’s functionality also appears to be broken, including the spyware app itself. TechCrunch analyzed the LetMeSpy phone app’s network traffic, which showed that the app appeared to be non-functioning at the time of writing.\nThe database also contained over 13,400 location data points for several thousand victims. Most of the location data points are centered over population hotspots, suggesting the majority of victims are located in the United States, India and Western Africa.\nThe data also contained the spyware’s master database, including information about 26,000 customers who used the spyware for free and the email addresses of customers who bought paying subscriptions.\nA world map showing the victims’ location data points in clusters around the U.S., India and parts of Africa.

{"num":60,"Time":"Tue 8 Mar 2022 09.01 CET","Title":"‘Constantly afraid’: immigrants on life under the US government’s eye","Content":"Macarena had just put on a pair of skinny jeans when her phone rang.\nPoor tech, opaque rules, exhausted staff: inside the private company surveilling US immigrants\nRead more\nOn the other end of the line was an employee from BI Inc, the private contractor tracking Macarena’s whereabouts on behalf of US immigration authorities. The employee had received an alert that the ankle monitor Macarena was wearing had been tampered with, Macarena recalled them saying. They asked if she was trying to take it off.\nMacarena was scared and confused. She was trying to make it out of the house with her children, she told the employee, explaining that the tight jeans must have moved the bulky device.\nShe’d have to come to the local BI office to prove it, the employee responded.\nIt was the spring of 2021 and Macarena, whose name has been changed to avoid compromising her immigration case, was two months into the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (Isap).\nThe US government program was launched in 2004 as a “humane” alternative to detention for immigrants waiting for their cases to be heard in court, a surveillance system that was supposed to keep track of people in the program while helping them access social services.\nSelected by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers, immigrants in the program are electronically surveilled through an ankle monitor, voice recognition or the company’s proprietary tracking app until their court date, and meet regularly with a case manager. Holding an exclusive, $2.2bn five-year contract to run Isap for Ice is BI, a company that got its start in monitoring cattle and is owned by one of the country’s largest private prison corporations, the Geo Group.\nWhile Isap has allowed some immigrants to go home rather than remain in immigration jail, the program is hampered by fundamental flaws, according to Isap participants, their lawyers and sponsors, as well as 10 BI employees.\nAnkle monitors can shock wearers and overheat, Isap participants say. Photograph: Brynn Anderson\/AP\nThey say BI’s technology is substandard, with ankle monitors causing bruising, overheating and at times sending out electroshocks and BI’s proprietary app frequently malfunctioning. Isap’s structure is as flawed as the tools it relies on, they argue, with arbitrary requirements and opaque decision-making processes inhibiting the ultimate goal of the program: transitioning out of it.\nBI referred the Guardian to Ice for all questions concerning its work on Isap.\nNicole Peckumn, assistant director of Ice’s office of public affairs, said on Monday that programs like Isap “are an effective method of tracking non-citizens released from DHS custody who are awaiting their immigration proceedings”.\nThe agency said Isap was effective at increasing court appearance rates among immigrants facing removal proceedings. BI had received an exceptional rating for its management of Isap at the time of its last contractor assessment, at the end of January, the agency added. Ice also said there was no proof the ankle monitor caused any physical harm.\nThe White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n‘My skin turned red and started bleeding’\nMacarena followed her mother to the US from her native Honduras nearly 17 years ago, when she was just 16. She settled in Virginia, got married and had two kids. In 2020, police were called to her home during a family conflict. Revealed to be undocumented, she was arrested and sent to an immigration detention center, leaving behind her husband, eight-month-old son and seven-year-old daughter.\n“Before I was sent to detention, I was paying taxes, we were working. I didn’t want to lose my daughter, my husband, my baby boy ... I lived in this country for almost 18 years,” she said.\nFour months after her arrest, Macarena was presented with a choice: remain detained until her court date or leave but wear an ankle monitor for a month. Desperate to reunite with her family, she chose the latter.\nSoon one month turned into 10, with the impact of the monitor extending far beyond what she had imagined. The belt on the bulky black monitor sat tightly above her ankle and it was heavy, she said, making it difficult to walk. Sometimes the device would overheat, burning the skin underneath.\n“I put a big Band-Aid or a sock between the belt and my skin because it was so hot,” she recalled. “My skin turned red and started bleeding because it was tight and hot at the same time.”\nIce said BI had conducted extensive testing of its products and had not reported any instances or evidence that the ankle monitors produced enough heat or power to overheat or shock someone. Ice did not respond to questions about whether the agency had independently verified the results of these tests.\nIce officers select participants in the Isap program. Photograph: Lucy Nicholson\/Reuters\nBI employees repeatedly accused Macarena of trying to tamper with the monitor, she said, including the time she had been struggling to put on her jeans. Once she was accused of disconnecting the ankle monitor when she was lying on her couch, sick. “I’m here on my sofa with fever and coughing. I think I have Covid,” she remembered telling the employee. “How am I gonna remove this?”\nOver time, Macarena said, she grew increasingly distraught. She tried to get a job cleaning houses or babysitting, but she said people didn’t trust her in their home when they saw her ankle monitor. She saw mothers pull their kids away from her in the park. She’d notice people pointing and staring at the device while she was out with her children, and she worried her daughter would hear people call her a criminal.\nThe burden of ‘over-policing’\nIsap participants around the country told similar stories to their lawyers and their sponsors, people who sign affidavits of support to help with the immigration process.\nRosalia and Sarah, whose names were also changed to avoid compromising their cases, were detained when they sought asylum in the US in 2018, fleeing anti-trans persecution in Honduras and El Salvador. They were enrolled in Isap after being detained and were fitted with ankle monitors. With that came other requirements: a BI worker would visit them every Friday – though they never were told what time – and their movements were restricted to the state their sponsor lived in. Once a week, they visited the BI office about 1.5 hours away.\nRosalia and Sarah’s sponsor, whose name is being withheld to avoid jeopardizing the women’s cases, described their experience in the program as dehumanizing and traumatizing. Once, Rosalia’s monitor had gotten so hot she had to wrap it with a towel to keep it from burning her leg, the sponsor said. Another time, Sarah had missed a home visit because she had gone to the store before a BI worker was scheduled to arrive. He had arrived 30 minutes early and Sarah had been accused of working illegally, the sponsor said. Rosalia’s case manager was cruel and always treated her with suspicion, the sponsor alleged.\n“They were really trying to catch them breaking the law,” the sponsor said. Nearly all asylum seekers show up for their court dates, they added, citing a study from the non-profit Vera Institute of Justice. “They really want to go through the legal process. So all of this over-policing and inviting the carceral system into people’s homes is not necessary.”\nSource: Vera Institute of Justice\nIce said not all people in Isap shared the same circumstances as the people evaluated in the Vera Institute study and that electronic monitoring technology contributed to the program’s success.\nIce said BI workers were trained to be objective and not to assume that a person in the program is trying to abscond, work illegally or intentionally violate their supervision regimen.\nVast immigration surveillance program in dire need of reform, Biden administration warned\nRead more\nSeveral former employees the Guardian spoke to said this had not been their experience and that while they had been taught that not everyone in the program had a criminal background, their training had included how to defend themselves against potential attacks.\nImmigrants speaking to a group of non-profits including Casa de Paz and the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition in Boulder, where BI is headquartered, said they too felt their case workers appeared intent on proving they were trying to abscond.\n“My Isap officer treats me like I am a criminal,” one immigrant told the non-profits, according to their report. “He yells at me. I feel constantly afraid that I may be doing something wrong.”\nAnother missed a home visit and was told they’d be arrested if they didn’t travel an hour and a half to the BI office to check in in person. “I had to pay someone $200 to take me,” they told the non-profits. “I have no income. I am an asylum seeker and I do not have work authorization yet.”\nFrequently, the immigrants reported, it was issues with BI’s own technology that made it impossible to meet requirements.\nInstead of wearing an ankle monitor, some in Isap are required to upload a location-tagged selfie to BI’s proprietary app, SmartLink, once a week. The company matches that image against the picture the person took when they were first enrolled. But Google Play and App Store reviews of the app listed a wide variety of issues, including people missing their check-ins because their pictures wouldn’t go through, the facial recognition technology had failed to recognize them, or the notifications hadn’t worked. “Couldn’t send a picture …” one review read. “Got a call and got told to delete and reinstall, I deleted the app and now I can’t install it back. They blamed us for not sending pictures. Ridiculous!”\nAsylum seekers embrace next to the US border wall, while waiting to be processed by US officials, last month in Yuma, Arizona. Photograph: Anadolu Agency\/Getty Images\nAlyssa Kane, the managing attorney at Aldea People’s Justice Center, an immigrant rights organization in Pennsylvania, said one woman represented by her organization couldn’t get SmartLink to work on her Cricket Wireless phone. When the woman had called BI to explain, employees had accused her of trying to abscond, Kane said. The woman had legal status and had been in the country for at least 15 years before she was sentenced to probation for pleading guilty to receipt of stolen goods, Kane added. But her technical difficulties were so bad that she was listed as not enrolled in the program and was given fugitive status.\n“All of this is for a 55-year-old woman who technically still has legal, permanent residency and an application pending with the immigration court and has been in and out of the hospital on multiple occasions for serious health issues,” Kane said.\nMaking matters worse are the program’s contradictory requirements and its opaque decision-making processes, immigrants and advocates say. Requirements to transition from an ankle monitor to app check-ins, for example, vary office-to-office, but could include participants paying for a work permit if they’re eligible and living in one place for at least 90 days. But participants report that ankle monitors – which are clearly visible and often loudly announce “batería baja” when they run out of battery – make it hard to hold a job and that few employers offer flexibility to go home for case manager check-ins. With no income, securing a place to live for 90 days or hiring an attorney is difficult. Participants have also reported needing to show BI a passport to make the transition, even though Ice had confiscated the document when they were detained.\nIt was unclear to participants and advocates how major decisions, such as immigrants’ transition from one level of surveillance to another, were made. Immigrants typically wear an ankle monitor for a minimum of six months, when some are expected to receive work authorization. But many end up wearing it for an average of one to three years. BI case workers can recommend participants’ “de-escalation”, but it’s up to Ice to approve the request. Two former BI case managers said Ice had only approved about about 20% of those they recommended for de-escalation and had offered few explanations for its decisions.\nBoth Rosalia and Sarah were given ankle monitors, but only one had it removed after receiving a work permit. The other had to keep wearing it for several more weeks. They weren’t given any reason for the discrepancy.\nFormer BI employees said it was these inconsistencies that drove people away before their court dates. “Some people never saw a light at the end of the tunnel and that’s why they abscond,” said Olivia Scott, a former BI case manager in Indiana. “There was no set protocol. So if you had a GPS unit on for three years, you’ve done everything, you have your work permit. What else is it that you need to do to get this unit off?”\nIce confirmed these decisions were made on a case-by-case basis and took into account criteria including immigration status, criminal history, compliance history, community or family ties, caregiver or provider concerns, and other humanitarian or medical conditions.\nIce prohibits attorneys from attending meetings between their immigrant clients and BI case managers. Photograph: Frederic J Brown\/AFP\/Getty Images\nHaving a lawyer appeared to help expedite the process to remove the device, some former employees and activists said.\nHowever, Ice prohibits attorneys from attending meetings between their clients and BI case managers, according to the 2020 Isap contract. Kane and Karen Hoffman, an attorney, said that made it difficult to ensure their clients had all the information they needed. Several of Hoffman’s clients had been given wrong court dates, while one had erroneously been told they faced a final order of deportation, she said.\nSurveillance fears\nAt least 182,607 people were enrolled in Isap as of January, according to Ice data, making it the largest supervision program of any US law enforcement agency. More than 60,000 people have entered the program in the last year, according to Ice. The Biden administration is expanding the program to include new levels of supervision, such as strict curfews.\nAfter wearing an ankle monitor for 10 months, Macarena had the device removed in the winter. Instead of being tracked through the monitor, she’s now sent a text once a week, after which she has to upload a location-tagged selfie to the SmartLink app. If something happens to her phone, she has to show up to the office to explain.\nMacarena’s ecstatic about the change. But experts worry about the long-term privacy ramifications of her surveillance regime.\nMacarena said she was told by BI employees the app is “always running” and that she always has to have the GPS on or else she could be put back on the ankle monitor. There’s little transparency into what information BI is collecting through SmartLink and even fewer regulations limiting what data it can collect. Ice said the app only tracked locations during check-ins but did not respond to questions about why Macarena and others in the program were told it was always tracking them.\nPrivacy experts and immigration advocates worry the company could share or sell the information, and that the data could be used against immigrants in other law enforcement contexts even once they gain legal status.\n“The way the immigration system operates is to make us believe that we have no other recourse,” said Maru Mora Villalpando, an organizer with the immigrant rights group Latino Advocacy. “When people are out of detention, they think they’re on the other side of it, but whatever company has a contract with Ice, we have to be afraid of.”\nMacarena is too relieved to have the monitor off to be worried.\n“I’m going to do whatever they’re asking me to do to not be in trouble and keep close to my family,” Macarena said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news article is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking.

Some fear that a ruling against Byrd might disproportionally affect lower-income Americans, who are more likely to depend upon rental cars for everyday travel because they can’t afford their own vehicles.\nChief Justice Roberts announces sexual harassment moves, touts disaster response in year-end report\nIn court Tuesday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor was concerned about the impact a ruling against Byrd would have on police power. She noted that even though Byrd’s name was not on the rental agreement, his friend, who had rented the car, allowed him to drive it.\n“If we rule that someone without permission has no expectation of privacy even when the renter has given it to them, then what we’re authorizing is the police to stop every rental car and search every rental car, without probable cause,” she said.\nJustice Stephen Breyer worried about the impact of the court’s opinion on other contract-related cases concerning, for instance, “houses, apartments, sublets, summer cabins,” all of which are governed by “understandings” and “leases.”\nThinking out loud, Breyer tested several different rules hoping to find something that would be easy for police officers to understand. “Fourth Amendment law is too complicated in a sense already,” he concluded.\nSupreme Court revives case of death row inmate who said juror was racist\nJustice Elena Kagan noted that the contract violation – someone driving a rental car even though his name wasn’t on the list – is not that rare.\n“Let’s be frank,” she said, it’s “not uncommon.”\n“What eliminates the right of privacy that you would normally get by opening up the car of a door and sitting in the front seat and turning the ignition key?” she asked.\nOn the other hand, Chief Justice John Roberts looked at the case from the perspective of the police officers making the stops and being forced to determine whether the driver had permission from the renter to drive the car.\n“Are (police) supposed to conduct an inquisition?” he asked.\nThe case dates back to 2014, when a police officer in Pennsylvania became suspicious because Byrd was sitting so far back in the driver’s seat he was barely visible. The officer noted that the Ford Fusion was a rental car and began to follow it on a four-lane highway. When Byrd failed to properly move into the right lane after passing a slower truck, the officer pulled him over for the minor violation, according to police.\nAfter some questioning, Byrd admitted that he had a marijuana cigarette in the car, according to police. The officers informed him that because his name was not on the rental agreement they could search the car without his consent. Later, police said they found the heroin. Among the charges was one count of possession of heroin with the intent to distribute.\nA three-judge panel of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Byrd, citing its own precedent “that society generally does not share or recognize an expectation of privacy for those who have gained possession and control over a rental vehicle they have borrowed without the permission of the rental company.”\nIn briefs to the Supreme Court, a lawyer for Byrd emphasized that his client’s girlfriend had allowed him to drive the car that she had rented.\n“She has given him both possession and control of the car, and he reasonably believes that he can exclude strangers and the government from intruding upon his private personal family possessions stored in the car,” Robert M. Loeb wrote. Loeb stressed that Byrd’s constitutional protections should not materially change because it turned out that he was not the authorized driver under a rental agreement.\nLawyers for the government, however, argued in court papers that he “did not own the car, had not rented it, and was not allowed to drive it.”\n“He cannot assert Fourth Amendment rights to object to its search,” Solicitor General Noel Francisco said.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union filed a brief in support of Byrd arguing that the lower court opinion would “severely curtail the scope of the Fourth Amendment” and affect a “broad swath of the population, especially individuals who have come to depend on rental cars for everyday travel because they cannot afford to purchase their own vehicle.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking because it discusses a case where a man named Terrence Byrd was stopped by police while driving a rental car in 2014.

{"num":63,"Time":"OCTOBER 10, 2019","Title":"Giuliani associates charged with illegally funneling cash to pro-Trump group","Content":"By Aram Roston, Brendan Pierson, Karen Freifeld\nWASHINGTON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two foreign-born Florida businessmen who have helped President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani investigate political rival Joe Biden were arrested in a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and other U.S. political candidates, prosecutors said on Thursday.\n \"I don't know them,\" Trump says of Giuliani associates\n00:36\nThe arrest of Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman at an airport outside Washington carrying one-way tickets to Vienna was the latest dramatic development in a political saga that threatens Trump’s presidency.\nProsecutors said Parnas and Fruman conspired to contribute foreign money including at least $1 million from an unidentified Russian businessman to candidates for federal and state offices to buy influence.\nProsecutors separately said they donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump political action committee called America First Action in May 2018, and the money was falsely reported as coming from a purported natural gas company set up to conceal its true source, according to the indictment.\nA fast-moving Democratic-led House of Representatives impeachment inquiry is centered on the Republican president’s request in a July phone call for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, the former vice president and a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable foreign ally to dig up dirt on a domestic political opponent for his own political benefit.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and has described the impeachment probe as a partisan smear.\nGiuliani has said Parnas and Fruman helped his efforts in Ukraine to investigate Biden and Biden’s son Hunter. The younger Biden had served as a director of a Ukrainian energy company.\nThe two men were each charged by federal prosecutors in New York with two counts of conspiracy, one count of false statements and one of falsification of business records. U.S. law prohibits foreign donations in American elections.\nParnas and Fruman were trying to buy political influence to help set up recreational marijuana businesses, prosecutors said. They also said Parnas played a role in a successful effort to have Trump remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n“Protecting the integrity of our elections, and protecting our elections from unlawful foreign influence, are core functions of our campaign finance laws,” U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman told reporters in New York. “And as this office has made clear, we will not hesitate to investigate and prosecute those who engage in criminal conduct that draws into question the integrity of our political process.”\nRELATED COVERAGE\nFactbox: Who are the Giuliani associates charged with trying to influence U.S. elections?\nTrump says he does not know the two associates of Giuliani\nSee more stories\nBerman served on Trump’s transition team after Trump was elected president to prepare for taking office in January 2017.\nThe indictment said Parnas and Fruman falsely claimed the company, called Global Energy Producers or GEP, which was making the political donations, was “a real business enterprise” and that “its major purpose is energy trading, not political activity.” In fact, the company had no real business, the indictment said.\nThe two were arrested at Dulles airport in Virginia on Wednesday night, prosecutors said.\nJohn Dowd, the lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, declined to comment on the charges. Dowd previously represented Trump in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that detailed Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to boost Trump’s candidacy.\nParnas and Fruman made their initial court appearance in Alexandria, Virginia, with another court date set for next Thursday. They were being represented in the court appearance by lawyers for Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is serving prison time after being convicted last year in Mueller’s investigation.\nFederal Magistrate Judge Michael Nachmanoff imposed a lengthy, strict set of conditions that Parnas and Fruman must meet to be released, including each posting $1 million bond and being placed on GPS monitoring in home detention. The prosecution called the men a flight risk.\nAsked for a response, Giuliani told Reuters he had “no involvement” in the flow of money at the heart of the Parnas and Fruman indictment.\nLast week, he told Reuters: “Parnas and Igor helped me on certain things. They helped me with logistics. They know the Ukraine, they speak Russian. They helped me locate people in a few cases.”\nJay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, told Reuters that “neither the president nor the campaign was aware of their scheme,” referring to the defendants.\nThe top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, called the developments regarding Giuliani’s associates “very troubling.”\nSlideshow ( 10 images )\n“Giuliani’s been involved up to his neck in this entire mess. He has an obligation to testify under oath so he can be asked questions and so this can come to light,” Schumer told reporters.\nHOUSE SUBPOENAS\nParnas and Fruman were both expected to figure in the House impeachment drive and had been asked to produce documents and give testimony. Parnas had been scheduled to take part in a deposition with House lawmakers on Thursday, with Fruman scheduled on Friday. Dowd had called the lawmakers’ demands “unreasonable.” House Democrats on Thursday issued subpoenas for the men to hand over the documents and testify at a later date.\nAccording to the indictment, Parnas also sought the help of a U.S. congressman - identified by a person familiar with the matter as Republican Pete Sessions - to get Trump to remove U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Trump eventually did remove Yovanovitch and called her “bad news” in his July 25 call with Zelenskiy.\nGiuliani told Reuters last week he had provided information to both Trump and the State Department about Yovanovitch, who he suggested was biased against Trump. Yovanovitch is scheduled to give testimony in the House impeachment inquiry on Friday.\nSlideshow ( 10 images )\nSessions lost his House seat from Texas last year to a Democrat. In a statement quoted by Politico, he said his motivation in urging the removal of Yovanovitch was his belief that “political appointees should not be disparaging the president, especially while serving overseas.”\nIn another development, House Democrats issued a subpoena for a member of Trump’s Cabinet, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, for documents over any role he may have played in Trump’s effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n“The Department of Energy is aware of the House Committees’ letter to Secretary Perry and it is currently under review by DOE’s Office of General Counsel,” said department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes.\nU.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is also expected to testify on Wednesday before the House committees on Wednesday, Axios reported, citing four unnamed congressional sources.\nThe committees subpoenaed Sondland after the State Department on Tuesday called off testimony by the ambassador after he had flown in from Brussels.\nProsecutors said Parnas, Fruman and others also conspired to funnel donations to candidates in Nevada, New York and other states to benefit a planned marijuana business funded by an unnamed Russian businessman.\nTwo other people were charged in the indictment: David Correia, a U.S. businessman, and Andrey Kukushkin, a Ukrainian-born U.S. businessman who was a vice president of a Russian hedge fund before becoming involved in several marijuana-related businesses in California.\nPhotos from Parnas’ social media accounts show him meeting on various occasions with Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., Sessions, Republican congressman Kevin Brady and former congressman Carlos Curbelo.\nIn an interview last month, Parnas told Reuters that the FBI was investigating him but that he did not know why, and that he did nothing wrong. “I don’t know what the FBI wants. I’m not going to comment, what they are doing. What they did.”\nParnas said any violations of U.S. Federal Election Commission rules were unwitting and a “clerical thing” because he was not an experienced political donor. Parnas said he was not trying to hide the source of the $325,000 donation.\nKelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for the America First Action political Action Committee, confirmed the pro-Trump group received the $325,000 contribution mentioned in the indictment. Sadler said the organization “placed that contribution in a segregated bank account,” and it has not been used “for any purpose.”\nReporting by Aram Roston, Brendan Pierson and Karen Freifeld; Additional reporting by Susan Heavey, Andy Sullivan, Jan Wolfe, Sarah N.

{"num":78,"Time":"6:45 PM GMT+2•August 30, 2021","Title":"Elon Musk’s Loop gets Autopilot — and an intruder","Content":"cameraImage Credits: Ethan Miller \/ Getty Images\nLess than two weeks after its official launch, The Boring Company’s Loop system in Las Vegas had its first security breach.\nOn June 21, the morning of the final day of the International Beauty Show, an “unauthorized vehicle” joined the system’s fleet of Tesla taxis underground, emails between the Loop’s operations manager and a Clark County official show. The emails were obtained by TechCrunch under public records laws.\nThe emails provide new insight into the operations of the Loop beyond the intrusion, including the system’s surprising reliance on a non-Tesla electric vehicle, plans to allow Tesla vehicles to use its Autopilot driver assistance system and confirmation within company ranks that the technology is not autonomous.\nThe Boring Company (TBC) called the Las Vegas Metro Police to handle the intrusion. “The driver of the unauthorized vehicle was cooperative and eventually escorted out of the system,” reads one email.\nWhile there were no injuries or fatalities as a result of the security breach, the incident could be embarrassing for TBC, which has touted the security and safety of its $53 million system to the LVCC.\nAccording to a management agreement between TBC and the LVCC, the system is supposed to have “physical barriers [to] guard against entry of accidental, rogue, or otherwise unauthorized vehicles into the tunnels.” These include security gates on roadways into the system, and dozens of concrete bollards surrounding its ground-level stations.\nNeither TBC nor LVCC responded to inquiries about the incident. TechCrunch will update the article if either party responds to questions.\nAutopilot gets a chance\nThe emails obtained by TechCrunch provide more than the exploits of a thrill-seeking trespasser.\nThe emails also detail plans by TBC to increase the number of Tesla vehicles in the LVCC Loop from 62 to 70, and to allow the use of Tesla Autopilot technologies. Until now, TBC has had to disable all driver assistance technologies on its vehicles, which are operated by human drivers.\nThe new scope of operations will require the use of seven active safety technologies — automatic emergency braking, front and side collision warnings, obstacle-aware acceleration, blind-spot monitoring, lane departure avoidance, emergency lane departure warning as well as two “full Autopilot” technologies: lane centering and traffic aware cruise control.\nTBC’s justification for using Autopilot was set out in a letter to the Clark County Department of Building & Fire Prevention in June, obtained by TechCrunch along with the emails.\nTBC president Steve Davis wrote that disabling the features “actively removes a layer of safety,” from a “proven, road-legal technology.” Davis quoted Tesla’s Safety Report for the first quarter of 2021 that claims Tesla drivers operating with Autopilot experienced crashes at less than a quarter the rate of Tesla drivers operating without Autopilot or active safety features, per mile driven. “As demonstrated… disabling these features in Tesla vehicles increases the likelihood of an accident,” wrote Davis.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), however, last week opened a formal safety probe into the technology, following a number of crashes.\nJerry Stueve, the director of the building and fire protection in Clark County, replied in an email: “We will take this under consideration, although it may help in our evaluation of this request if you can better define the term ‘autodrive’ and what it entails.”\n“Agreed that the term ‘Autopilot’ is often unclear and can mean many different things depending on the vehicle and scenario,” replied Davis. (In this, he apparently disagrees with his boss, Elon Musk, who has called criticism of the Autopilot name as misleading “idiotic.”)\n“Agreed that the term ‘Autopilot’ is often unclear and can mean many different things depending on the vehicle and scenario.” – Steve Davis, TBC\n“These are not ‘autonomous’ nor ‘self-driving’ vehicles,” continued Davis. “The use of Tesla Autopilot and active safety features adds additional layers of safety while operating the vehicle, however the use of the features still requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take over the wheel at any moment.”\nAutopilot versus autonomous driving\nThis distinction is key, as it appears to contradict what TBC has promised LVCC since it first pitched the Loop system. In its land use application in May 2019, prior to signing the construction construct, TBC wrote: “Tesla Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEVs) will carry passengers in express, underground tunnels to three underground stations.”\nA planning document in July 2019 stated: “Utilizing autonomous electric vehicles in underground tunnels is a unique transportation solution that will minimize disruptions and conflicts to existing buildings and transportation systems.” It has used similar language in applications ever since, including for a proposed Vegas-wide Loop with dozens of stations.\nIn January, TechCrunch obtained a management agreement between LVCC and TBC that stated: “[The LVCC] procured the People Mover System, in part, because of the ability for People Mover System vehicles to operate autonomously … The Agreement recognizes the intent for the System to move from drivers in the vehicles to autonomous operations and provides for a fee renegotiation, no later than December 31 2021, incorporating this expected transition in operations.”\nThat deadline now seems almost certain to be missed. In June, Stueve told Davis: “As stated early in the project, the approval of autonomous operation will require extensive scrutiny, testing and validation. This process could take a significant amount of time.”\nIn reply, Davis wrote: “I want to make sure that it is clear that we are not asking for autonomous or self-driving features\/operations.”\nHumans in the Loop\nThe problem is two-fold. One is that Tesla’s Autopilot system may not be able to operate completely without a driver for some time to come. The second, arguably more serious, challenge is that the Loop is heavily reliant on its drivers to meet the safety requirements for underground transportation systems, laid out in national standards. Passengers of such systems, whether monorails, subways or using electric cars, must be safe in the event of power outages, fires, floods and other emergencies.\nThe LVCC Loop’s basis of design document, obtained by TechCrunch along with the emails, states: “[Our] trained drivers serve as the system’s key layer of safety. In the event of an emergency, actions taken by drivers to direct passengers in the proper and safe directions are the primary risk mitigating responses.”\nOther documents obtained by TechCrunch from BFP confirm this. In the case of fire, the driver will “assist with deboarding passengers, and guide passengers on foot to the closest exit. Driver issues verbal instructions and may physically assist passengers.” As the driver leads passengers by walking ahead of them, they must “consistently look back to ensure every passenger is following closely behind.”\nDrivers are responsible for assessing and responding to unruly or misbehaving passengers, and, in fact, for supervising the performance of the Autopilot itself, says TBC. “The [Loop] will have drivers, ensuring that there is always someone overseeing the use of active safety features who is ready to take over braking and steering as needed,” wrote Davis in June.\nNone of the dozens of documents or hundreds of emails obtained by TechCrunch, including those detailing the LVCC Loop’s future expansion, describe a path or timetable for TBC to move toward fully autonomous operation.\nIn response to a questionnaire on how the Loop will meet the American Society of Civil Engineers’ safety principles for autonomous systems, TBC responded: “Criteria specific to autonomous operation are not applicable to the [LVCC Loop], as the system will have drivers to operate vehicles.”\nOnly time will tell whether what TBC is telling Clark County, or what it is telling LVCC, is closer to how the Loop will operate in the future.\nIn the meantime, if the Loop vehicles are not yet driverless, can the LVCC at least expect them all to be the latest Tesla models? Perhaps not.\nAnother requirement for the Loop is that it complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In an email to Clark County officials in July, a TBC executive noted that it was going to buy a non-Tesla ADA electric vehicle for the LVCC Loop.\nAlthough the email did not specify the model, it has a low-range lead-acid battery with the same specification as the Tropos Motors Able electric utility vehicle. Neither Tropos nor TBC responded to inquiries.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking as it reports an unauthorized vehicle breaching The Boring Company's Loop system in Las Vegas.

{"num":89,"Time":"Published 6:28 AM GMT+2, September 28, 2016","Title":"AP: Across US, police officers abuse confidential databases","Content":"DENVER (AP) — Police officers across the country misuse confidential law enforcement databases to get information on romantic partners, business associates, neighbors, journalists and others for reasons that have nothing to do with daily police work, an Associated Press investigation has found.\nCriminal-history and driver databases give officers critical information about people they encounter on the job. But the AP’s review shows how those systems also can be exploited by officers who, motivated by romantic quarrels, personal conflicts or voyeuristic curiosity, sidestep policies and sometimes the law by snooping. In the most egregious cases, officers have used information to stalk or harass, or have tampered with or sold records they obtained.\nNo single agency tracks how often the abuse happens nationwide, and record-keeping inconsistencies make it impossible to know how many violations occur.\nBut the AP, through records requests to state agencies and big-city police departments, found law enforcement officers and employees who misused databases were fired, suspended or resigned more than 325 times between 2013 and 2015. They received reprimands, counseling or lesser discipline in more than 250 instances, the review found.\nUnspecified discipline was imposed in more than 90 instances reviewed by AP. In many other cases, it wasn’t clear from the records if punishment was given at all. The number of violations was surely far higher since records provided were spotty at best, and many cases go unnoticed.\nAmong those punished: an Ohio officer who pleaded guilty to stalking an ex-girlfriend and who looked up information on her; a Michigan officer who looked up home addresses of women he found attractive; and two Miami-Dade officers who ran checks on a journalist after he aired unflattering stories about the department.\n“It’s personal. It’s your address. It’s all your information, it’s your Social Security number, it’s everything about you,” said Alexis Dekany, the Ohio woman whose ex-boyfriend, a former Akron officer, pleaded guilty last year to stalking her. “And when they use it for ill purposes to commit crimes against you — to stalk you, to follow you, to harass you ... it just becomes so dangerous.”\nThe misuse represents only a tiny fraction of the millions of daily database queries run legitimately during traffic stops, criminal investigations and routine police encounters. But the worst violations profoundly abuses systems that supply vital information on criminal suspects and law-abiding citizens alike. The unauthorized searches demonstrate how even old-fashioned policing tools are ripe for abuse, at a time when privacy concerns about law enforcement have focused mostly on more modern electronic technologies. And incomplete, inconsistent tracking of the problem frustrates efforts to document its pervasiveness.\nThe AP tally, based on records requested from 50 states and about three dozen of the nation’s largest police departments, is unquestionably an undercount.\nSome departments produced no records at all. Some states refused to disclose the information, said they don’t comprehensively track misuse or produced records too incomplete or unclear to be counted. Florida reported hundreds of misuse cases of its driver database, but didn’t say how often officers were disciplined.\nAnd some cases go undetected, officials say, because there aren’t clear red flags to automatically distinguish questionable searches from legitimate ones.\n“If we know the officers in a particular agency have made 10,000 queries in a month, we just have no way to (know) they were for an inappropriate reason unless there’s some consequence where someone might complain to us,” said Carol Gibbs, database administrator with the Illinois State Police.\nThe AP’s requests encompassed state and local databases and the FBI-administered National Crime and Information Center, a searchable clearinghouse that processes an average of 14 million daily transactions.\nThe NCIC catalogs information that officers enter on sex offenders, immigration violators, suspected gang members, people with outstanding warrants and individuals reported missing, among others. Police use the system to locate fugitives, identify missing people and determine if a motorist they’ve stopped is driving a stolen car or is wanted elsewhere.\nOther statewide databases offer access to criminal histories and motor vehicle records, birth dates and photos.\nOfficers are instructed that those systems, which together contain data far more substantial than an internet search would yield, may be used only for legitimate law enforcement purposes. They’re warned that their searches are subject to being audited and that unauthorized access could cost them their jobs or result in criminal charges.\nYet misuse persists.\n____\n‘SENSE OF BEING VULNERABLE’\nViolations frequently arise from romantic pursuits or domestic entanglements, including when a Denver officer became acquainted with a hospital employee during a sex-assault investigation, then searched out her phone number and called her at home. A Mancos, Colorado, marshal asked co-workers to run license plate checks for every white pickup truck they saw because his girlfriend was seeing a man who drove a white pickup, an investigative report shows.\nIn Florida, a Polk County sheriff’s deputy investigating a battery complaint ran driver’s license information of a woman he met and then messaged her unsolicited through Facebook.\nOfficers have sought information for purely personal purposes, including criminal records checks of co-workers at private businesses. A Phoenix officer ran searches on a neighbor during the course of a longstanding dispute. A North Olmsted, Ohio, officer pleaded guilty this year to searching for a female friend’s landlord and showing up in the middle of the night to demand the return of money he said was owed her.\nThe officer, Brian Bielozer, told the AP he legitimately sought the landlord’s information as a safety precaution to determine if she had outstanding warrants or a weapons permit. But he promised as part of a plea agreement never to seek a job again in law enforcement. He said he entered the plea to avoid mounting legal fees.\nSome database misuse occurred in the course of other misbehavior, including a Phoenix officer who gave a woman involved in a drug and gun-trafficking investigation details about stolen cars in exchange for arranging sexual encounters for him. She told an undercover detective about a department source who could “get any information on anybody,” a disciplinary report says.\nEric Paull, the Akron police sergeant who pleaded guilty last year to stalking Dekany, also ran searches on her mother, men she’d been close with and students from a course he taught, prosecutors said. A lawyer for Paull, who was sentenced to prison, said Paull has accepted responsibility for his actions.\n“A lot of people have complicated personal lives and very strong passions,” said Jay Stanley, an American Civil Liberties Union privacy expert. “There’s greed, there’s lust, there’s all the deadly sins. And often, accessing information is a way for people to act on those human emotions.”\nOther police employees searched for family members, sometimes at relatives’ requests, to check what information was stored or to see if they were the subjects of warrants.\nStill other searchers were simply curious, including a Miami-Dade officer who admitted checking dozens of officers and celebrities including basketball star LeBron James.\nPolitical motives occasionally surface.\nDeb Roschen, a former county commissioner in Minnesota, alleged in a 2013 lawsuit that law enforcement and government employees inappropriately ran repeated queries on her and other politicians over 10 years. The searches were in retaliation for questioning county spending and sheriff’s programs, she contended.\nShe filed an open-records request that revealed her husband and daughter were also researched, sometimes at odd hours. But an appeals court rejected her suit and several similar cases this month, saying the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the searches were unpermitted.\n“Now there are people who do not like me that have all my private information ... any information that could be used against me. They could steal my identity, they could sell it to someone,” Roschen said.\n“The sense of being vulnerable,” she added, “there’s no fix to that.”\n___\nBETRAYAL OF TRUST\nViolations are committed by patrol officers, dispatchers, civilian employees, court personnel and high-ranking police officials. Some made dozens of improper searches. Some were under investigation for multiple infractions when they were punished, making it unclear whether database misuse was always the sole reason for discipline.\nAgencies uncover some violations during audits, or during investigations into other misconduct. Some emerge after a citizen, often the target of a search, finds out or grows suspicious. A Jacksonville, Florida, sheriff’s officer was found to have run queries on his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend after she raised concerns she was being harassed, an internal affairs report says.\nThe AP sought to focus on officers who improperly accessed information on others but also counted some cases in which officers divulged information to someone not authorized to receive it, or ran their own names for strictly personal purposes, including to check their car registrations.\nThe tally also includes some cases in which little is known about the offense because some agencies provided no details — only that they resulted in discipline.\nThe AP tried when possible to exclude benign violations, such as new employees who ran only their own names during training or system troubleshooting. But the variability in record-keeping made it impossible to weed out all such violations.\nAgencies in California, for instance, reported more than 75 suspensions, resignations and terminations between 2013 and 2015 arising from misuse of the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, state records show. But because the records didn’t identify officers or specify the allegations, it’s unclear whether multiple violations were committed by the same person or how egregious the infractions were.\nColorado disclosed about 35 misuse violations without specifying punishment. Indiana listed 12 cases of abuse but revealed nothing about them. The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles reported about 400 violations in 2014 and 2015 of its Driver and Vehicle Information Database, or DAVID, but didn’t include the allegations or punishment.\nThe FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division offers training to state and local law enforcement agencies on NCIC use, and conducts audits every three years that include a sample of local departments, said spokesman Stephen Fischer.\nBut it doesn’t track how often NCIC information is misused. Violations, which are not required to be reported directly to the FBI, are inconsistently disclosed to the federal government. The FBI relies on local agencies to address violations that are identified, Fischer said.\nThe AP requested records from large police departments and state agencies tasked with administering NCIC usage within their districts. The responses included cases where officers misused motor vehicle data, including driver’s license and registration information, and also more sensitive criminal history records.\nOfficers are only occasionally prosecuted, and rarely at the federal level.\nOne recent exception is a former Cumming, Georgia, officer charged in June with accepting a bribe to search a woman’s license plate number to see if she was an undercover officer. Another involved Ronald Buell, a retired New York Police Department sergeant who received probation for selling NCIC information to a private investigator for defense attorneys.\nAt his July sentencing, Buell said he hoped other officers would learn “to never put themselves in the position I’m in.”\nIt’s unsettled whether improper database access is necessarily a federal crime and whether it violates a trespass statute that criminalizes using a computer for other than authorized purposes.\nA federal appeals court last year reversed the computer-crime conviction of ex-NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, whom tabloids dubbed the “cannibal cop” for his online exchanges about kidnapping and eating women and who improperly used a police database to gather information. Valle argued that as an officer, he was legally authorized to access the database. The court deemed the statute ambiguous and said it risked criminalizing a broad array of computer use.\nMisuse has occasionally prompted federal lawsuits under a statute meant to protect driver’s license data.\nA Florida Highway Trooper, Donna Watts, accused dozens of officers of searching her in the state’s driver database after she stopped a Miami-Dade officer for speeding in 2011. She alleged in lawsuits that she was harassed with prank calls, threatening posts on law enforcement websites and unfamiliar cars that idled near her home.\nEach unlawful access, she said in a court document, “has either caused or worsened anxiety, depression, insomnia, and other medical\/physical\/psychological conditions I suffer.”\nLaw enforcement officials have taken steps to try to limit abuse, though they say they know of no foolproof safeguard given the volume of inquiries and the need for officers to have information at their fingertips.\n“There’s no system that could prohibit you from looking up your ex-wife’s new boyfriend, because your ex-wife’s new boyfriend could come in contact with the criminal justice system,” said Peggy Bell, executive director of the Delaware Criminal Justice Information System.\nThe Minnesota Department of Public Safety said it changed the way officers access a state driver database after a 2013 legislative audit found over half of the 11,000 law enforcement personnel who use it made searches that appeared questionable. The audit was conducted after a former state employee was charged with illegally viewing thousands of driver’s license records.\nIn Florida, a memorandum of understanding this year increased the amount of field audits law enforcement agencies must undergo regarding DAVID usage. Troopers in the Florida Highway Patrol sign usage warnings when they access the DAVID system and a criminal sanctions acknowledgment. Users are audited and instructed to select a reason for a search before making inquiries.\nDenver’s independent monitor, Nicholas Mitchell, argued for strong policies and strict discipline as a safeguard, especially as increasing amounts of information are added to databases. His review found most of the 25 Denver officers punished for misusing databases over 10 years received at most reprimands.\nMiami-Dade police cracked down after the Watts scandal and other high-profile cases. The department now does quarterly audits in which officers can be randomly asked to explain searches. A sergeant’s duties have been expanded to include daily reviews of proper usage and troubleshooting, said Maj. Christopher Carothers of the professional compliance bureau.\nEven if the public is unaware of the amount of available information, Carothers said, “The idea that police would betray that trust out of curious entertainment or truly bad intent, that’s very disturbing and unsettling.”\n____\nEric Tucker reported from Washington.

It said last month it plans to publish a proposed rule by July 21, having previously vowed to publish the proposal by May 1.\nThe regulator has grappled with many complex issues behind identifying drones remotely, with disagreement among industry and various federal agencies over software and hardware requirements and how to address privacy and data security.\nAn FAA advisory committee issued a report in 2017 laying out options for remotely identifying drones, but did not agree on all recommendations.\nEarlier this month, the FAA said it was investigating a drone that hovered over Boston’s Fenway Park during a Red Sox baseball game. The drone’s manufacturer said the user apparently overrode a system designed to prevent flights over prohibited areas such as sporting events.\nThe drone appeared to be a DJI Phantom, the U.S. unit of Shenzhen, China-based SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd said, adding the “incident shows why the federal government must mandate a remote identification system for airborne drones as soon as possible.”\nIn January, the FAA said 43 flights into New Jersey’s Newark Liberty International Airport were required to hold after a nearby reported drone sighting. London’s second busiest airport, Gatwick, was severely disrupted in December when drones were sighted on three consecutive days.\nChao in January proposed rules allowing drones to operate over populated areas to help speed their commercial use. The department noted they cannot be finalized “without a remote identification rule in place.”\nLast week, Alphabet Inc’s Wing Aviation unit got FAA approval to start delivering goods by drone in Virginia later this year, making the sister unit of search engine Google the first drone delivery company to get U.S. air carrier certification.

{"num":90,"Time":"JUNE 16, 2012","Title":"Obama spares many young illegal immigrants deportation","Content":"By Jeff Mason, Richard Cowan\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought into the United States as children will be able to avoid deportation and get work permits under an order on Friday by President Barack Obama.\nUndocumented UCLA students attend a graduation ceremony for \"Dreamers\" or Dream Act students at a church near the campus in Los Angeles, California June 15, 2012. REUTERS\/Jonathan Alcorn\nIn a move that seemed to be aimed at Hispanics whose enthusiasm for voting in the November 6 election could be crucial to Obama’s re-election chances, the president acted to potentially protect 800,000 people from deportation proceedings for at least two years.\nObama, who previously was reluctant to impose such an order even as Republicans in Congress blocked immigration reform bills he supported, called his action “the right thing to do.”\nHis announcement was on the 30th anniversary of a Supreme Court decision that said children of illegal-immigrant parents were entitled to public education in the United States.\nIt allowed Obama, whose administration has faced criticism from some Hispanic groups for deporting about 400,000 illegal immigrants a year, to draw a sharp contrast between himself and Republican Mitt Romney, his opponent in the election. Romney, in trying to appeal to his party’s most conservative voters, has taken a harsh stance against illegal immigration.\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Obama emphasized that his stop-gap policy did not grant amnesty or citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. He said that such people “are Americans in their hearts and minds; in every single way but one - on paper.”\nBoth Democrats who praised Obama’s move and Republicans who attacked it agreed that Congress ultimately should decide the permanent fate of immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents.\nMost Republicans continue to clamor for more law enforcement before considering any loosening of immigration rules for the estimated 12 million people who are in the country illegally. Obama emphasized various steps he has taken to secure the southwestern U.S. border, the entry point for most of the immigrants living illegally in the United States.\nPOWER OF THE PRESIDENCY\nObama’s order was the second time in two months that he has reached out to a key Democratic voting constituency. Last month, he said for the first time that he supports legalizing gay marriages, a move that while largely symbolic, won him praise and campaign donations from the gay and lesbian community.\nFriday’s appeal to Hispanics came at a time when Obama’s popularity has dipped amid new worries of a weakening economy and a deepening European financial crisis that further threatens American jobs.\nMeanwhile, Republicans in the deeply fractured U.S. Congress have blocked most of Obama’s domestic initiatives, some of which he said would have created millions of jobs.\nObama’s order came a week before he is scheduled to address a meeting of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Florida. Romney also is set to address the group next week.\nThe meeting is likely to feature Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican who has pushed for legislation that would help children of illegal immigrants.\nObama’s order also came as the U.S. Supreme Court is considering a challenge to Arizona’s strict immigration laws that target people living and working in the state illegally. A ruling could come as early as next week.\nA ‘POWER GRAB’\nRomney, campaigning in New Hampshire, said Obama’s move made it more difficult to reach a long-term solution for young illegal immigrants “who come here through no fault of their own.” He said he would like to see legislation to help such people but did not offer a plan of his own.\nEarly this year, during the Republican presidential primaries, Romney said he favored “self-deportation” in which illegal immigrants realize they would be better off returning to their native countries after employment restrictions left them unable to find work in the United States.\nOther Republicans were more harsh in criticizing Obama.\n“Today’s announcement by President Obama is a politically motivated power grab that does nothing to further the debate but instead adds additional confusion and uncertainty to our broken immigration system,” said Obama’s 2008 Republican challenger for the White House, Senator John McCain of Arizona.\nAnother Republican, House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, called Obama’s order a “breach of faith” that Smith said will have “horrible consequences” for unemployed Americans who are looking for jobs only to find that illegal immigrants will work for less money.\nSome Republicans suggested that Obama’s move could face legal challenges but several law professors said Friday that it is unlikely that Obama’s order could be challenged successfully in court. Presidents have broad executive power for such temporary orders and prosecutorial discretion.\nGeorge Washington University law professor Orin Kerr said criminal enforcement is the domain of the executive branch and deportation decisions would fall under that authority.\nUniversity of Houston law professor Michael A. Olivas said Friday’s directive is well within a president’s usual authority.\nPolitical analysts cast Obama’s move as a savvy strategy for what could be a very close race for the White House.\n“The Obama administration knows it’s in a very tight race and if the margins that it enjoyed among unmarried women, gays, Hispanics and blacks don’t hold, then he might end up on the wrong end of this thing,” said Cal Jillson, a politics professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “So he’s going around and touching all these bases.”\nOBAMA’S REVERSAL\nUnder Obama’s plan, those who qualify would be allowed to live and work in the United States for two years and could be eligible for extensions, the Obama administration said.\nU.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who made the initial announcement of Obama’s order on Friday, said that illegal immigrants up to 30 years old who came to the United States as children and do not pose a risk to national security would be eligible to stay in the country and allowed to apply for work permits.\nTo avoid deportation under Obama’s plan, a person must have come to the United States under the age of 16 and have resided in the country for at least five years.\nThey must be in school or have graduated from high school or be honorably discharged from the U.S. military. They also must not have been convicted of any felony or significant misdemeanor offenses.\nObama has long supported measures to allow the children of illegal immigrants to study and work in the United States, but efforts to pass such measures in Congress have failed amid objections by Republicans.\nThe Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act passed the House in 2010, when Democrats controlled that chamber. But it fell a few votes short in the Senate, amid strong Republican opposition.\nFriday’s announcement was a victory for Hispanic groups that have long called on Obama to use his executive powers and it marked somewhat of a reversal by the administration. Last July, in a speech to the National Council of La Raza, Obama said he was reluctant to bypass Congress.\nThere are up to 2 million illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children and who remain in the country, according to immigration group estimates. U.S. officials said the new measures would affect roughly 800,000 people.\nMost of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States are Hispanics. There are now 51 million Hispanics living in the United States out of a total population of 309 million.\nAdditional reporting by Donna Smith, Samson Reiny, Alister Bull, Andy Sullivan, Laura MacInnis and Joan Biskupic; Editing by David Lindsey and Bill Trott\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking because it discusses President Barack Obama's executive order to protect hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought into the United States as children from deportation.

Brian Kemp, it’s now illegal to hand out food or water to people standing in line to vote.\n“No person shall solicit votes in any manner or by any means or method, nor shall any person distribute or display any campaign material, nor shall any person give, offer to give, or participate in the giving of any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink, to an elector,” the new law states.\nThe law applies within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of any voter at a polling place. Violators are guilty of a misdemeanor.\nBut some observers see the provision as an attempt to curb voting by urban voters and people of color who lean Democratic and whose precincts often have long waits to cast ballots.\nThe latest on Georgia's new law suppressing voting access\nOne influential Black pastor said he thinks the new law is unreasonable and that his church will use it to fire up voters.\n“We will make a movement out of that,” said the Rev. Tim McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. “You know something is wrong when you can’t give grandma a bottle of water and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.”\nMcDonald told CNN he is already planning to test the law with some civil disobedience. He said that at a future election his church will dare the police to arrest someone giving water to an elderly person waiting to vote.\nAttorney Walter Shaub, former director of the US Office of Government Ethics, also has criticized the measure as an attempt to target voters of color.\n“Georgia’s bill would make it a crime to give free food or water to voters standing in line for hours and hours. But we know who these politicians force to stand in line all day long,” Shaub said earlier this month on Twitter. “I’ve never once stood in line for even five minutes where I get to vote. This racism is thorough.”\nThese two photos show who Georgia's new elections law benefits -- and hurts\nRepublicans have defended the measure, dubbed Election Integrity Act of 2021, saying it’s required to boost confidence in voting after last year’s election. Kemp said the law will “ensure elections in Georgia are secure, fair, and accessible.”\nGeorgia, long seen as a politically red state, turned blue in this past election as President Joe Biden and two Democratic senators won narrow victories, boosted partly by heavy turnout among Black voters.\nGeorgia’s bill is part of a broad effort by GOP-led legislatures across the country to pass restrictive voting measures in battleground states such as Arizona, Michigan and Florida.\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, vowed last December – a week before the state’s runoff election – that the state would crack down on “line warming,” or handing gifts to voters in line as a way to “inappropriately influence voters in the crucial final moments before they cast their ballots.”\nCNN’s John Blake, Kelly Mena and Dianne Gallagher contributed to this report","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Unauthorized GPS tracking because it discusses a new law in Georgia that makes it illegal to hand out food or water to people standing in line to vote.

Some patients who require emergency treatment may have to wait several hours for an ambulance to arrive.\nDr Selvaseelan Selvarajah, a GP partner in east London, said: “If somebody is not having a heart attack or a stroke, my default advice is ‘have you got someone who can drive you or do you want to get an Uber?’\n“These are patients who may have breathing difficulty or are suffering severe abdominal pain, but their life is not in immediate danger.” He said such patients would have previously been transferred by ambulance.\nHealth bosses say the major delays in ambulance services are being caused by handover delays at A&E departments, with vehicles queueing for hours before their patients are seen.\nThe proportion of delays exceeding one hour in handovers from an ambulance to a hospital in England increased from 3% in October 2020 to 18% in October 2022, according to the latest figures published by the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives. The number of handovers exceeding an hour reached about 52,000 in October, the highest number to date.\nDr Neena Jha, who works as a locum GP in Hertfordshire, said: “I’ve never seen ambulance services stretched to this degree because of the pressures they are under. It’s really worrying when you’re dealing with an acutely unwell patient.\n“If someone needs an urgent transfer to accident and emergency, we don’t rely on the ambulance service. We call taxis or get relatives to drive them in if they are going to be stable on the journey.\n“I’ve had patients who have falling oxygen levels, who are quite unwell, and I have been quoted an 18-hour wait for an ambulance.”\nThe NHS says the problem of ambulances queueing at A&E departments is caused by hospitals being full to capacity. Photograph: Andy Rain\/EPA\nJha said it was often a dilemma as to whether to keep a patient at the practice and wait for an ambulance with oxygen on hand, or take the risk of them going unaccompanied to hospital to ensure they get faster access to the medical attention they need.\nShe said the delays in the ambulance service were highlighted when she was treating a baby this month at risk of cardiac arrest. She had initially been given a waiting time of two and a half hours and said the baby’s life may have been saved by the fact that a vehicle was redirected and reached the practice she was working at within 10 minutes.\nIt was reported in April that Deborah Lee, head of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS foundation trust, was driven to hospital by her husband after a suspected stroke because he had heard her lamenting ambulance delays. She wrote on Twitter: “What if my husband hadn’t been there and my daughter called for an ambulance and I’d been put in the [Category 2] ‘stack’?”\nGPs say they are increasingly concerned about the risk to patients because of wider failures in the health system. Doctors at a conference of local medical committee representatives on Thursday supported a motion which stated “general practice in England is unsafe due to a shortage of doctors and a lack of investment”.\nDr Kieran Sharrock, deputy chair of the General Practitioners Committee England at the British Medical Association, said: “We are committed to our patients and so we carry on, but we know that this trajectory for general practice cannot continue if it is to survive.”\nThe NHS says the problem of queueing ambulances at A&E departmentsis caused by hospitals being full to capacity, with delays in discharging patients into the community or social care. An NHS spokesperson said: “Ahead of what is likely to be a challenging winter for the NHS, services are facing considerable demand, with the busiest October ever for A&E attendances, difficulties discharging thousands of patients who are medically fit for discharge – and that is alongside new data this week showing a 10-fold increase in the number of flu cases in hospital compared to last year.\n“NHS staff are working incredibly hard to prepare for the busy period with plans for new 24\/7 system control centres, falls response services and additional beds and call handlers – so it is vital that people continue to come forward for care when they need it by using 999 and A&E in an emergency and 111 Online for other health conditions.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to vehicle accidents due to navigation errors because it discusses delays in ambulance response times and the advice given by some GPs to patients to use cabs or private vehicles to reach the hospital more quickly.

The lawsuit, filed against Tesla by the passengers and Lee’s estate, accuses Tesla of knowing that autopilot and other safety systems were defective when it sold the car.\nJonathan Michaels, an attorney for the plaintiffs, in his opening statement at the trial in Riverside, California, said that when the 37-year-old Lee bought Tesla’s “full self-driving capability package” for $6,000 for his Model 3 in 2019, the system was in “beta”, meaning it was not yet ready for release.\nMichaels said the car’s steering wheel made a sharp, 43-degree turn on a freeway, adding that “excessive steering command is a known issue at Tesla.”\nTesla denied the claims, saying its autopilot system puts “guardrails” on the angle of the steering wheel at high speeds, making it capable of steering only a little bit left or right on highways. It also defended the system’s safety and blamed the driver for being intoxicated.\n“The case is not about autopilot,” Michael Carey, an attorney for Tesla, said. “Autopilot makes a road safer. It is a good thing,” he said. “It is a classic human error that caused the crash.”\nThe electric carmaker also claims it was not clear whether autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash.\nTesla has been testing and rolling out its autopilot and more advanced full self-driving system, which Elon Musk has touted as crucial to his company’s future but which has drawn regulatory and legal scrutiny.\nTesla won a bellwether trial in Los Angeles in April over a Tesla crash related to its autopilot feature with a strategy of saying that it tells drivers that its technology requires human monitoring, despite the “autopilot” name. In that incident in 2019, a Model S swerved into a curb and injured the driver. Jurors told Reuters after the verdict that they believed Tesla warned drivers about its system and that driver distraction was to blame.\nSign up to First Thing\nFree daily newsletter\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But for some people, subtle differences emerge in how they control a vehicle, which scientists say are associated with the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\nIn an experiment to find out whether these driving differences can be detected using Global Positioning System-based (GPS) location-tracking devices, a group of over-65s in Missouri in the US agreed to have their driving closely monitored for one year.\nThe DRIVES Study at Washington University in St. Louis, led by Catherine Roe and Ganesh Babulal and funded by the National Institute on Aging, wanted to find out was whether just studying the driving habits of this group alone could reveal the start of the disease - without the need for invasive or expensive medical procedures.\nAfter 365 days accumulating the information, they are confident that it could.\nAmong the 139 people involved in the study, medical tests had already shown around half of them had very early or \"preclinical\" Alzheimer's disease. The other half did not. Analysis of their driving revealed detectable differences between the two groups.\nSpecifically, those with preclinical Alzheimer's tended to drive more slowly, make abrupt changes, travel less at night, and logged fewer miles overall, for example. They also visited a smaller variety of destinations when driving, sticking to slightly more confined routes.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nWith Alzheimer's, an early diagnosis is critical and an MRI scan is currently one of the best ways to do this\n\"How people move within their daily environments, ranging from the places they visit to how they drive, can tell us a lot about their health,\" says Sayeh Bayat, a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, who led the study.\nGPS trackers fitted to the participants' cars revealed these movements, and when they occurred, in detail.\nThe researchers running the study had previously split their participants into those with preclinical Alzheimer's disease, and those without, using medical tests such as spinal fluid tests and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\nBut using the results of the driving data, they were able to design a model that could forecast someone's likelihood of having preclinical Alzheimer's using merely their age and their GPS driving data. It proved to be 86% accurate.\n\"Using these very few indicators… you can really, with very high confidence, identify whether a person has preclinical Alzheimer's disease or not,\" says Ms Bayat.\nThe model was more accurate still (90%) when it also added in the results of a genetic test for Alzheimer's known as apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping that indicates whether you may have an inherited risk for the disease. (Although it's worth bearing in mind this group only represents some of the people who eventually go on to develop Alzheimer's).\nBut the prediction based on age and driving alone was almost as precise.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nROE LAB\nImage caption,\nGPS trackers were used to monitor a group of over-65s road usage over a year\nLarger, randomised studies are needed to show a definitive link between the detected driving behaviours and preclinical Alzheimer's disease.\nHowever, the potential game changer here is that this could be a low-cost way of detecting the condition at an earlier stage, potentially supporting treatment. But it also raises the question of whether older people would want their behaviour to be tracked so closely, even if there were health benefits.\nThe fact that people's driving behaviour changes when they have Alzheimer's is well documented. The US National Institute on Aging says family members might eventually notice that their loved one is taking longer to complete a simple trip, has been driving more erratically, or gets muddled over which pedal is which, for example.\nMore Technology of Business\nTired of working from home?

That distinction, says Ms Bayat, requires gathering data over time for detailed analysis.\nShe adds that participants in the study with preclinical Alzheimer's would, in some cases, drive less at night, restrict their driving to slightly smaller areas around their home or travel more slowly than expected.\nThe best way to predict, via driving data, whether someone without preclinical Alzheimer's could be at risk of developing it might be to monitor their road use over a longer period of time. That would be likely to reveal changes in their driving, says Ms Bayat.\nLaura Phipps at Alzheimer's Research UK says the study is \"really interesting\", adding that changes in driving behaviour are often noticed by family members of a person who is later diagnosed with the disease.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH UK\nImage caption,\nLaura Phipps, Alzheimer's Research UK says the disease can start to show up in the brain two decades prior to symptoms emerging\n\"What they'll say to us is, often one of the first symptoms or signs that they noticed is that their loved one started… to get lost,\" says Dr Phipps.\nShe says there are currently relatively few drugs available to treat early Alzheimer's disease, but she hopes this will change in future. If this were the case, then having an early indication of who is likely to develop the condition - without the need for costly or invasive procedures - could help doctors know when to prescribe treatments.\n\"Research has shown that, actually, the disease can start in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms show,\" she says.\nInsights from driving or other behaviours such as changes in how people speak could also prompt lifestyle changes that might help to keep Alzheimer's at bay. The UK's National Health Service advises that taking care of your cardiac health while also remaining socially and mentally active are among the preventative measures people can take.\nThe idea that analysis of the way you drive could help people manage and potentially even delay the start of more severe Alzheimer's symptoms sounds tantalising. But there is always the possibility that errors could creep into this analysis. Or that the results could have negative consequences.\nMany drivers of all ages already allow their insurer to use telematics or a black-box to monitor their driving, which can result in a lower insurance premium. But in the future could such devices accurately predict your risk of Alzheimer's and take that into account as well?\nAlthough this potential scenario is a long way off for the insurance market, it's something that might worry existing owners of black boxes who have already experienced issues with their devices' accuracy in the past.\nRhoda Au at Boston University argues that customers should have more control over where their data goes in general, to avoid unfair discrimination of their habits or behaviours. \"They should have the right to decide what does and does not get shared,\" she says.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nRHODA AU\nImage caption,\nRhoda Au says the early identification of people who might be at risk of dementia could be very useful\nShe jokingly notes that her own driving could be viewed as erratic: \"I'm just thinking, like, God, these people at Google must think I'm nuts… I have no sense of direction.\"\nProf Au says that, in general, new data gathering systems designed to find subtle correlations between behaviour and medical conditions are likely to have flaws. But given the potential benefits of being able to identify people at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease early on, there is good reason to carefully explore those possibilities now.\n\"You have to start somewhere,\" she says.\nRelated Topics\nLife\nLifestyle\nAlzheimer's","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to vehicle accidents due to navigation errors because it discusses how changes in driving behavior, which can be detected through Global Positioning System-based (GPS) location tracking, are associated with the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

Walker and Rodas died at the scene.\nInvestigators with the Los Angeles county sheriff's department and California highway patrol concluded that unsafe speed, not mechanical problems, caused the 30 November crash, the sheriff's department said on Tuesday.\nBased on post-crash calculations, accident reconstruction specialists deteremined Rodas was driving his 2005 Porsche Carrera GT at between 81mph and 94 mph.\nInvestigators had previously found no evidence the car had mechanical problems and had ruled out debris or other roadway conditions.\nPorsche sent engineers to California to review the car's wreckage. Though it was badly mangled and burned, they said there were no signs of any problems with the car's electrical systems, brakes, throttle, fuel system, steering, suspension or other systems that might have caused the crash.\n\"The results of the investigation show that, according to all the available evidence, this crash was caused by dangerous driving at speeds much too high for the road in question,\" Porsche said in a written statement. \"We stand by our Carrera GT and by the investigation.\"\nThe conclusion about the speed was based on a \"yaw\" mark that one of the car's tires left on the road in an area of industrial office parks in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north-west of downtown Los Angeles. Witnesses told a sheriff's deputy that they thought the car could have been traveling in excess of 100mph.\nPost-crash investigators said the car had an exhaust system modified for greater speed and three of its tyres were nine years old when they should have been changed after four, which meant \"the drivability and handling characteristics ... may have been compromised\".\nRodas, 38, and Walker, 40, had taken what was supposed to be a quick ride on a clear afternoon from a fundraiser benefiting Reach Out Worldwide, a Walker charity that gives first-response aid to victims of natural disasters.

The train missed the rear of one vehicle by less than half a second, and only came to a stop 230 metres further down the track.\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch said the near-miss, at Norwich Road level crossing, near New Rackheath, Norfolk, was likely caused by leaves on the line coating the railhead – the top of the railway track’s steel rails that come into contact with wheels.\nInvestigators said the contamination could have interrupted the electrical signal that identified the train’s position, prompting the level crossing barriers to operate. A treatment train that cleans the rails did not run on weekends on the line, leaving the buildup for more than two days in a period of heavy leaf fall.\nSimon French, the chief inspector of rail accidents, said: “All too often the interaction between road users and the railway at level crossings leads to incidents and accidents.

It said the railroad lacked a policy to screen engineers for sleep disorders, which also contributed to the 1 December crash. It also said a system that would have automatically applied the brakes would have prevented the crash.\nThe board also issued rulings on four other Metro-North accidents that occurred in New York and Connecticut in 2013 and 2014, repeatedly finding fault with the railroad.\n“This would be almost a comedy of errors if it weren’t so tragic,” Senator Chuck Schumer, said Tuesday. “It’s clear these mistakes were avoidable.”\nThe NTSB had reported Rockefeller’s sleep apnea in April, saying tests revealed it interrupted his sleep dozens of times each night. Investigators said Rockefeller told them he had felt strangely “dazed” right before the crash. But until Tuesday it had refrained from declaring his sleepiness the cause of the crash.\nIt said that less than two weeks before the crash, Rockefeller had switched from a work day that began in late afternoon to one that began early in the morning. The board said that probably compounded his sleep problem.\nIt also noted that the technology known as positive train control was not in use at the time of the crash. Positive train control can automatically bring a train to a stop if it’s exceeding a speed limit. Metro-North has said it is working to install the technology.\nOn the other accidents, the NTSB found:\nA 17 May 2013, derailment and collision in Bridgeport, Connecticut, was caused by broken joint bars, which are used to join rails of different sizes. At least 65 people were injured. The board said Metro-North had deferred scheduled track maintenance and lacked “a comprehensive track maintenance program”.\nA track foreman who was fatally struck by a train in West Haven, Connecticut, on 28 May 2013, was probably due to a mistake by a student rail traffic controller. The controller misunderstood some instructions and canceled the signals protecting the section of track the man was on, the NTSB said.\nIn a similar accident in Manhattan on March 10, 2014, a worker was killed by a train while trying to re-energize tracks that had been out of service for maintenance. The NTSB blamed the accident of briefings that poorly communicated which part of the track would be safe.\nThe derailment of a freight train on Metro-North tracks in the Bronx on 18 July 2013, which caused no injuries, was caused by deteriorated concrete ties and other problems compounded by deferred maintenance, the NTSB said.\nIn March, the Federal Railroad Administration issued a stinging report on Metro-North, saying the railroad let safety concerns slip while pushing to keep trains on time. Railroad executives pledged to make safety their top priority.\nSenator Richard Blumenthal said Monday that the new NTSB report documents “the cascading catastrophes over a single year illustrating the urgent need for dramatic upgrades and improvements in safety and reliability”.\nMetro-North is the second-largest commuter rail line in the country.

In the larger group, who were given two full doses also four weeks apart, efficacy was 62%.\nVaccine results bring us a step closer to ending Covid, says Oxford scientist\nRead more\nScientists said they still could not fully explain why the half dose gave better protection, but said it may be that it triggers the immune system differently.\nProf Sarah Gilbert from Oxford University, who led the research, said: “It could be that by giving a small amount of the vaccine to start with and following up with a big amount, that’s a better way of kicking the immune system into action and giving us the strongest immune response and the most effective immune response.”\nProf Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and chief investigator of the trial, added: “What we don’t know at this moment is whether that difference is in the quality or the quantity of immune response. And that’s something we’re going to be digging into over the next weeks.”\nThe vaccine still needs to be approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, but could be made available in the coming weeks if given the go-ahead.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is not about vehicle accidents due to navigation errors.

The agencies are also investigating the battery fire that followed the crash.\nTesla later said the car had activated Autopilot, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks. The company said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by Huang before the crash and that he had received warnings to put his hands on the wheel.\nThe NTSB confirmed on Wednesday that it has two other pending investigations of other Tesla crashes, including a probe of an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, that occurred after an owner lost control and ran into his garage. That fire probe had not previously been reported.\n“We’re really more looking at the fire aspects,” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt told Reuters, saying that the battery continued to ignite even after it was loaded onto a truck.\nTesla did not immediately comment on the August incident.\nThe NTSB previously said it also is probing an incident in which a Tesla vehicle apparently travelling in semi-autonomous mode struck a fire truck in California in January.\nThe law firm said its preliminary review suggested the autopilot feature was defective and had uncovered complaints by other Tesla drivers of navigational errors by the system.\n“(Our) preliminary review indicates that the navigation system of the Tesla may have misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, failed to brake the car, and drove the car into the median,” Minami said.\nWhile sympathizing with the family, Tesla again blamed Huang, saying he was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he had told them it was not reliable in that exact location, but nonetheless engaged Autopilot.\nTesla said the system always reminds drivers to be alert and have hands on the wheel and had warned Huang several times on the day of the crash to do so.\n“The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,” a Tesla spokesperson told Reuters.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Patrick Graham and Dan Grebler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to vehicle accidents due to navigation errors.

Boeing’s 737 Max planes were grounded worldwide following the crashes.\nThe MCAS should be redesigned to include a backup and all systems that can take over flight control should receive closer scrutiny during certification, according to the final report published by the investigators on Friday.\n“The investigation considered that the design and certification of this feature was inadequate,” the report said. “The aircraft flight manual and flight crew training did not include information about MCAS.”\nTimeline\nBoeing’s 737 Max crisis\nShow\n\nThe report also found that Boeing failed to detect a software error resulting in a warning light not working and failed to provide pilots with information about the flight control system.\n“The absence of guidance on MCAS […] in the flight manuals and pilot training made it more difficult for flight crews to properly respond to uncommanded MCAS,” said a presentation shown by investigators in Jakarta on Friday.\nLion Air jet crash: cockpit voice recorder found, says Indonesian official\nRead more\nBoeing has already said it plans to remake the system and provide more information about it in pilot manuals. The company still expects the troubled 737 Max jet to return to service by the end of the year.\nThe final report said the first officer onboard was unfamiliar with procedures and had shown issues handling the aircraft during training.\nThe report also found that a critical sensor providing data to an anti-stall system had been miscalibrated by a repair shop in Florida and there were strong indications it had not been tested during installation by Lion Air maintenance staff.\nLion Air should have grounded the jet following similar faults on the plane’s previous flight, the report said, adding that 31 pages were missing from the airline’s October maintenance logs. Lion Air did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe Indonesian investigators also made recommendations that regulators, including the US Federal Aviation Administration and its counterpart in Indonesia, improve their oversight over certification and maintenance.\nThe report is one of multiple investigations, including those by US regulators and Congress, faced by Boeing into the crashes of what was previously its most popular plane.\nThe crisis has led Boeing to set aside $4.9bn (£3.8bn) to cover the costs of the groundings. On Wednesday, the company announced it made $20bn in revenues during the third quarter of the year, down by more than a fifth from the previous year. Profits fell by more than 50%.\nOn Friday, Boeing said it had implemented three new software fixes for the MCAS issues that would mean it was not dependent on a single sensor and that would allow a pilot to override it. Boeing has completed a certification test flight with the updates in place.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nDennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive officer, who had the chairmanship removed this month, said: “On behalf of everyone at Boeing, I want to convey our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in these accidents. We mourn with Lion Air, and we would like to express our deepest sympathies to the Lion Air family.”\n“We are addressing [Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee’s] safety recommendations, and taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again.”\nBoeing still expects to regain regulatory approval for the 737 Max “in the fourth quarter of 2019”. The company hopes to increase its rate of production of the aircraft – which it cut in the aftermath of the flight bans – from 42 per month to 57 per month by late 2020.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to vehicle accidents due to navigation errors.
