{"num":14,"Time":"Tue 6 Mar 2018 07.00 CET","Title":"Counter-mapping: cartography that lets the powerless speak","Content":"Sara is a 32-year-old mother of four from Honduras. After leaving her children in the care of relatives, she travelled across three state borders on her way to the US, where she hoped to find work and send money home to her family. She was kidnapped in Mexico and held captive for three months, and was finally released when her family paid a ransom of $190.\nHer story is not uncommon. The UN estimates that there are 258 million migrants in the world. In Mexico alone, 1,600 migrants are thought to be kidnapped every month. What is unusual is that Sara’s story has been documented in a recent academic paper that includes a map of her journey that she herself drew. Her map appears alongside four others – also drawn by migrants. These maps include legends and scales not found on orthodox maps – unnamed river crossings, locations of kidnapping and places of refuge such as a “casa de emigrante” where officials cannot enter. Since 2011, such shelters have been identified by Mexican law as “spaces of exception”.\nThis kind of work is an example of the growing field of counter-mapping. The title of a seminal paper in the field, Whose Woods Are These?, gives a succinct summary of what is involved. The paper’s author, Nancy Peluso, studied land ownership in the forests of Kalimantan, Indonesia, just as the government and the timber industry were mapping large tracts of land with the purpose of opening them up to logging and mineral exploration. Not surprisingly, where the official maps were blank, counter-maps from indigenous people told a very different story of generations of use, as well as customs and disputes among and within different tribes. Woods are, of course, particularly interesting as from time immemorial they have been the refuge of outlaws, bandits or whoever the state deems to be “other”. In Haiti, slaves typically gathered in the forests above plantations, prior to the birth of the first black republic.\nTravelling through tree-covered areas is a slow and arduous process, as is travel through politically unstable areas. Scale on an orthodox map is uniform; counter-maps can represent psychological as well as physical distances that are rarely linear or uniform. In the town of Duvergé in the Dominican Republic, I once interviewed a Haitian migrant who had dealt with civil unrest, a long mountain chain, forests, police checkpoints and clusters of militias (chimères) on his journey across the border. Although geographically his home town was only 177km away, he was psychologically about as close to home as a Londoner is to Murmansk.\nCounter-mapping’s ability to capture this fragmentation also makes it a useful tool for documenting physical transformations wrought by climate change. In the Arctic, melting sea-ice is opening up the Northwest Passage to the possibility of greater transcontinental shipping. Questions of sovereignty over these waters are pressing, and the traditional function of maps has been to impose the stamp of a crown on vast swaths of the Earth. In the Arctic, as in Africa and Asia through the 19th century, it suited many Europeans, Russians and Americans to think the land was empty before they arrived. In the mining town of Labrador City, there are curiously named lakes: Tanya Lake, Beverly Lake, Carol Lake. Curious, until you learn that Carol was the wife of the chief geologist of the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC). The names date from the 1950s.\nHow 'smart ice' is helping to save lives on Canada's thinning sea ice\nRead more\nIn reality, there are few empty parts of the Earth, as is usefully shown in the Pan Inuit Trails Project, developed by Prof Michael Bravo of the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University. Using archive and published material as well as fieldwork and interviews, Bravo and colleagues created an interactive map of Pan Inuit trails that crisscross vast territories of the Arctic. Knowledge of these trails has been passed down through generations of Inuit voyagers through a combination of maps and storytelling. An earlier explorer of the Arctic, William Brooks Cabot, once noted in relation to the maps indigenous people drew for him: “Like all Indian maps, they are made only to travel by. For this purpose, however, their maps are often better than ours. One needs to be used to their method.”\nCounter-mapping often pays greater attention to “their method” than orthodox mapping. There are more than just Cartesian coordinates in the world. Detailed knowledge of the thickness of ice, places of shelter and predators are engraved in Inuit stories. Indeed, the naming continues; within the great Rapa valley in Sarek, the Swedish wilderness, is a small area recently given the name Rovdjurstorget (Predator Square) because the tracks of all four large predators that exist in the wild in Sweden (bear, wolverine, wolf and lynx) have been found there.\nAnd if a scientist frowns at the mention of storytelling, just remind them of the names of places to be found in anatomical atlases of the brain – the amygdala (the almond) , the hippocampus (the seahorse) , the globus pallidus (the pale globe) . Mapping is eternally linked to stories, and counter-mapping acknowledges the use of more than one knowledge base. It also has the possibility to counter the naïve, sometimes malign, simplicity of state lines. Arctic people in particular know a thing or two about these lines – the Sami were often burdened with paying taxes to three nation states at a time.\nOne of the fundamental overlaps between the counter-mapping of the Arctic and the journeys of migrants is that in both cases there is no single scientific or technical solution to the problem at hand. Alleviating the problem depends as much on ethics as equations, and Inuit people have different ethical obligations to the Arctic to IOC geologists. The answer to the question “whose woods are these?” is not singular. Counter-mapping at least helps us to give more weight and representation to customs and claims on the land that have traditionally been ignored.\nReferences\nThe International Migration Report 2017 (Highlights), Multimedia Library – United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Human Rights of Migrants and Other Persons in the Context of Human Mobility in Mexico, Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, 2013\nCampos-Delgado, A, Counter-Mapping Migration: Irregular Migrants’ Stories Through Cognitive Mapping, Mobilities, 2018, 0: 1–17 Peluso, NL, Whose Woods Are These?

Nepal’s new map locates the small stretch of disputed land within its northwest border, between China and India.\nThe cartographic dispute is based on differing interpretations of treaty signed by the British East India Company with the King of Nepal in 1816, which established the boundary between the two countries. Though both sides have long claimed the territory as their own, Wednesday marked the first time Nepal issued a map including the disputed area. India already includes the contested area in its own official map.\nThe dispute was reignited on May 8, when Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh virtually inaugurated a newly built 80-kilometer (50-mile) road connecting India’s Dharchula to Tibetan autonomous region via the Lipulekh pass, which is part of the contested area.\nIndia expects the route to facilitate trade and the movement of Hindu pilgrims to Mansoravar lake in Chinese-administered Tibet, which is considered auspicious.\nBut hundreds of angry Nepali protesters took to the streets across Nepal opposing the Indian inauguration, burning Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s effigy and called it a violation of their territorial sovereignty.\nNepal responded quickly. On May 9, its foreign ministry issued a statement asking India to “refrain from carrying out any activity inside the territory of Nepal.”\nIndia responded, saying that the inaugurated road section lies “completely” within its territory, and that the two countries would discuss it after the worst of the coronavirus pandemic had passed. “Both sides are also in the process of scheduling Foreign Secretary level talks which will be held once the dates are finalized between the two sides after the two societies and governments have successfully dealt with the challenge of Covid-19 emergency,” the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement.\nModi models a tight grip on power as Trump visits India\nThe next day, the Nepali government summoned the Indian ambassador over the matter.\nSpeaking in parliament on Tuesday, Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli suggested India was bullying Nepal, and warned, “We won’t let go the issue of Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani. This is our land and we will reclaim it. It is not a disputed land. It is our land. India created unnecessary controversy by claiming it as theirs. This government will make concrete efforts to reclaim the territories.”\nEven China weighed in that day, with Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian saying during a daily press conference: “We hope the two countries will resolve their differences properly through friendly consultations and refrain from taking any unilateral action that may complicate the situation.”\nOn Wednesday, Nepal officially unveiled its revised and expanded national map – a move that India’s foreign ministry quickly criticized as “unilateral” and lacking in “historical facts and evidence.” “Such artificial enlargement of territorial claims will not be accepted by India,” the ministry added in its statement.\nNepal has not explained why the areas were not previously included in its national map.\nAn earlier version of this story misstated Defense Minister Rajnath Singh’s role.

{"num":19,"Time":"Updated 3:40 AM EDT, Wed September 30, 2020","Title":"China is doubling down on its territorial claims and that’s causing conflict across Asia","Content":"CNN\n — \nSince taking power in 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has helped cement China’s position as a global superpower – and pushed forward an aggressive foreign policy, making bolder moves in several key flashpoints across Asia.\nFrom the South China Sea to the Himalayan Sino-Indian border, and even in one of its own cities, China has doubled down on its claims of territory, and taken a harder line in response to perceived challenges.\nAnd as those disputes escalated this year with renewed and rising tensions, Xi has bulked up the military and increased its budget, with the instruction to “resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.”\nHere’s what you need to know about China’s key flashpoints in the Asia-Pacific region.\nWhy are countries fighting over the South China Sea?\nDotted with small islands, reefs and shoals, the South China Sea is a crucial global shipping route and home to a messy territorial dispute.\nWho claims what: China claims it owns almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea, but at least six other governments also have overlapping territorial claims in the contested waterway: the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan.\nThe United States doesn’t have any claims in the waters, but has repeatedly challenged China’s claims.\nChina went ahead and built islands anyway: Since 2014, China has turned numerous obscure reefs and sandbars – far from its shoreline – into man-made artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems, prompting outcry from the other governments.\nThe US and its allies have pushed back by sailing warships through the South China Sea close to features claimed or occupied by China, in what it calls freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS). They say such patrols enforce the right of free passage in international waters; China argues these are violations of its sovereignty.\nThe Chinese-controlled artificial island of Mischief Reef in the South China Sea, as seen by CNN from a US reconnaissance plane on August 10.\nBut things are escalating now: The US has stepped up its challenges this year; it formally rejected China’s claims as illegal, and sanctioned dozens of Chinese companies for building the artificial islands. In July, two US Navy aircraft carriers conducted joint military drills in the sea for the first time in six years – a strong show of force.\nAll this has sparked Chinese fury and escalated tensions; China launched a series of ballistic missiles into the sea, with state-run media warning that “China does not fear a war.”\nWhy this matters: Under international law, whoever owns the contested string of islands in the sea will have the rights to all the resources in its nearby waters like fish, oil and gas. More broadly, whoever controls this sea will also hold power over one of the world’s most valuable trading routes – it hosts one third of all global shipping.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nWhy it matters who owns the seas (April 2021)\n03:48 - Source: CNN\nWhat’s the deal with Taiwan?\nTaiwan is a self-governing democratic island of around 24 million people, which split from mainland China in 1949 after the end of a bloody civil war.\nChina insists Taiwan is its territory: Authorities in Beijing claim full sovereignty of Taiwan, even though Taiwan has never been controlled by China’s ruling Communist Party. The two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.\nFor years, Beijing has attempted to impose diplomatic, trade and military pressure on Taipei, marginalizing it in the international community – for instance, China has successfully blocked Taiwan from joining global agencies like the World Health Organization.\nWhat this means for other countries: Most countries abide by China’s demand that Taiwan not be recognized as an independent nation, publicly observing Beijing’s view there is “one China” – though many governments also maintain close unofficial ties with Taiwan.\nThings escalated this summer: Recent months have seen a warming relationship between the US and Taiwan – much to China’s ire.\nTwo high-profile US officials visited Taiwan in the space of two months, in a symbolic show of support by the Trump administration. In August, the US also sold 66 fighter jets to Taiwan, the biggest arms sale to the island in years.\nIn response, China carried out a series of military drills and aircraft incursions in the waters and airspace near Taiwan – marking a significant escalation in tensions.\nChinese officials warned in September that “China firmly opposes any form of official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan.” Some have also hinted at the threat of sanctions against US officials.\nPresident Xi has been clear in his ambitions to “reunify” the island with the mainland, and has refused to rule out the use of force. Recent military drills were described in Chinese state media as a “rehearsal for a Taiwan takeover” and threats of invasion have increased sharply as tensions with the US rise.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nDecoding the China-Taiwan relationship\n02:24 - Source: CNN\nWhy are China and India clashing in the Himalayas?\nThe China-India conflict is centered around a long-disputed border in the Himalayas.\nAfter fighting a bloody border war in 1962, the two countries drew up a loosely-defined demarcation line called the Line of Actual Control (LAC).\nBut they disagree on its location: Though the LAC shows up on maps, the two nuclear powers do not agree on its precise location and both regularly accuse the other of overstepping it, or seeking to expand their territory.\nThey have an uneasy status quo: The countries signed a series of agreements in the 1990s to try to keep the peace, including an agreement that neither side shall open fire within 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) of the LAC.\nBut things got ugly this year: This June saw the bloodiest Sino-Indian clash in more than 40 years. Troops at the border fought with fists and stones, in a brawl that killed at least 20 Indian soldiers; China didn’t acknowledge any casualties. Both sides accused the other of overstepping the border.\nThings heated up in September after each side accused the other’s troops of firing warning shots. It’s believed to be the first time shots have been fired along the border since 1975.\nWhere things stand now: Officials are now in de-escalation talks; in late September, both sides agreed to stop sending troops to the border, and to strengthen communications.\nBut a meaningful peacekeeping mechanism could be a long way off – partly because of the increasingly assertive foreign policy on both sides.\nWhy is China fighting Japan over a few tiny islands?\nBoth China and Japan have claimed a rocky, uninhabited island chain in the East China Sea as their own.\nLocated 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo, the islands are known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyu Islands in China.\nThe islands are also claimed by Taiwan, where they are known as the Tiaoyutai islands.\nThe overlapping claims: Both China and Taiwan say their claims to the island chain extend back to the 1400s, when it was used as a staging point for Chinese fisherman.\nHowever, Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands during an 1885 survey, so it formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. The US occupation of Japan after World War II complicated things – but the islands were eventually returned, and Japan has administered them since the 1970s.\nWhy this matters: The area has much-coveted resources; it holds a rich fishing ground, and recent surveys suggest that the waters around the islands may contain oil and natural gas deposits.\nA Japanese military plane flies over the Senakuku\/Diaoyu islands in this file photo.\nHow things escalated: China and Japan have engaged in tit-for-tat struggles for years, with the issue escalating sharply in September 2012 after the Japanese government formally purchased the islands from their private Japanese owner. This resulted in some of the largest protests seen in major Chinese cities in decades.\nTensions rose again this June after a Japanese city council bill asserted that “the islands are part of Japanese territory.”\nChina, meanwhile, has flexed its military muscles; Japan announced in June that Chinese government ships have been spotted in waters near the islands every day since April. And in July, Chinese coast guard ships intruded into Japan’s territorial waters multiple times, forcing the Japanese coast guard to block them from approaching Japanese fishing boats.\nThe number of warplanes from China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) flying close or around Japan’s southwest air zone, which includes the contested island chain, has also increased exponentially in recent years, according to Japan’s Air Self Defense Force (JASDF).\nWhere things stand now: The two countries have stepped up their rhetoric; Japan has lodged diplomatic protests, and China has accused Japan of infringing on its sovereignty.\nThe escalation this summer has raised international alarm; under a mutual defense pact with Tokyo, the US is obligated to defend the islands as part of Japanese territory.\nWhat’s going on in Hong Kong?\nThe semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong was plunged into a political crisis in 2019 as anti-government protests brought much of the territory to a standstill. Protesters had many complaints, including alleged police brutality and limited democratic freedoms – but at the heart of it all is the city’s conflicted relationship with the central government in Beijing.\nIs Hong Kong part of China? Yes – but as a former British territory, it was granted freedoms of press, speech, and assembly when it was handed back to China in 1997. Hong Kong also has its own legal and political systems, currency and trade. These freedoms stand in stark contrast to China’s authoritarian leadership and strict censorship.\nSo what’s the conflict? Under the handover agreement, Hong Kong is supposed to keep its limited autonomy until 2047 – but many Hong Kongers say China is violating that promise and encroaching on their freedoms. This fear was heightened by a controversial extradition bill last year, which kicked off the protests and was later scrapped.\nMeanwhile, China has criticized the movement as a threat to security and stability. Some protesters have also called for Hong Kong independence, and asked other countries for assistance, which China condemned as an unacceptable challenge to its national sovereignty.\nHow things escalated: In June, China cracked down by imposing a national security law for Hong Kong, entirely bypassing the city’s own legislature. Details of the law weren’t released to the public until it had passed.\nChina said the law, which grants Beijing sweeping new powers, is necessary to curb unrest; critics say it’s a devastating blow for Hong Kong’s freedoms.\nWhere things stand now: The law has already been used to make numerous arrests; for instance, several people were arrested in September for using protest slogans, which are now criminalized. Those convicted under the law could face sentences of up to life in prison.\nSince it came into force, political parties have disbanded, protest signs were pulled down across the city, and Hong Kongers are fleeing to seek asylum or refuge in other countries.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nActivists are fleeing Hong Kong, once a safe haven\n03:22 - Source: CNN","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n{\n\"Title\": \"China is doubling down on its territorial claims and that’s causing conflict across Asia\",\n\"Location\": \"Asia-Pacific region\",\n\"Summary\": \"China has been asserting territorial claims and pursuing an aggressive foreign policy across Asia, leading to conflicts in various regions.

{"num":8,"Time":"NOVEMBER 15, 2017","Title":"Threats and torn maps test India's digitisation of century-old land titles","Content":"By Rina Chandran, Thomson Reuters Foundation\n4 MIN READ\nNEW DELHI, Nov 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - India’s push to digitise its land records to minimise conflicts and increase transparency of transactions is marred by torn maps, tradition and disputes dating back decades, according to an analysis of the progress made by three states.\nThe national land record modernisation programme, launched in 2008, aims to survey lands, update records and establish ownership. It is scheduled to be completed in 2021 after overshooting its budget and deadline.\nThe government says the programme has covered about 565,000 villages, or 86 percent of all recorded villages. But progress is uneven, with many states unable to re-survey lands to determine their boundaries and ownership.\n“Re-surveying is a difficult, long drawn process. There are legacy issues and other complications because the records are 100 years old,” said S. Chockalingam, director of land records in Maharashtra.\n“So getting digital records to mirror reality is a challenge,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nLand records in most Indian states date back to the colonial era. Most holdings have uncertain ownership, fraud is rampant and disputes over titles often lead to protracted court battles.\nMatters related to land and property make up about two-thirds of all civil cases in India, according to a study released last year.\nMeasurement errors, land use discrepancies, multiple owners and short-staffed local offices hampered the digitisation of land records in the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh, the analysis found.\nUpdating or correcting records took between 26 and 535 days.\n“About 30 percent of existing maps cannot be used as they are torn or illegible,” said Diya Uday at the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research that surveyed Maharashtra’s records.\n“In some places, we were unable to measure land because we were threatened, and in others we could not locate the owners.”\nDistortion of India’s land markets hamstrings economic growth, accounting for 1.3 percent of lost gross domestic product growth every year, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the global consulting firm.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is keen to unlock this value and has made digitisation of land records a priority.\nRajasthan state has set up an independent authority to verify land titles in its cities, while others are exploring blockchain - the technology behind the bitcoin currency - to increase efficiency in land deals.\nBut customary tenure, where boundaries are often verbally agreed, and the tradition of sons inheriting land also pose challenges, said T. Haque, chairman of the land policy unit at government thinktank Niti Aayog.\n“These are sensitive issues that can’t be solved by digital records,” he said.

The line marks China’s claim to much of the South China Sea – a demarcation opposed by Vietnam and other south-east Asian countries and which was repudiated by an international tribunal in The Hague in 2016.\nWarner Bros defended the map and suggested in a statement published by Reuters that it carried no significant meaning. “The map in Barbie Land is a whimsical, child-like crayon drawing,” the studio said. “The doodles depict Barbie’s make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the real world. It was not intended to make any type of statement.”\nBarbie was due to be released in Vietnam on 21 July, according to local media, which reported that its screenings would no longer go ahead, and that posters advertising the film had been removed from movie distributors’ websites.\nSome senators in the Philippines have called for Barbie to be banned, or for a form of disclaimer to be added to counter the map. The film is currently being considered by the Philippines’ Movie and Television Review and Classification Board.\n“The movie Barbie is fiction, and so is the nine-dash line,” said senator Risa Hontiveros. “At the minimum, our cinemas should include an explicit disclaimer that the nine-dash line is a figment of China’s imagination.”\nOn Thursday it was reported that Vietnam’s authorities would also inspect the website of K-pop group Blackpink’s tour operator, after it was alleged it featured a map that displayed the “nine-dash line”, which runs close to Vietnam’s coast and includes much of what Vietnam considers its continental shelf.\nVietnam and the Philippines have frequently banned films and TV dramas over their depictions of the South China Sea. In 2021 Australian spy drama Pine Gap was banned in Vietnam, while two episodes were removed in the Philippines. The DreamWorks’s animated film Abominable was also pulled from cinemas in both countries in 2019, as was the action movie Uncharted last year.\nThe Philippines and Vietnam are both on the frontlines of the dispute over the South China Sea, a resource rich and strategically important waterway and one of the busiest trading routes in the world.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard and representatives of the fishing community have frequently complained about harassment by Chinese vessels. Earlier this year the Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, summoned the Chinese ambassador to express serious concern after a Chinese coastguard ship was accused of directing a “military-grade laser light” at a Philippine ship.\nA group that represents Philippine fisherfolk said it was less bothered about the Barbie movie, and called for other forms of government action to protect the Philippines’ rights in the sea.\n“The Marcos administration would appear much tougher if it directly confronts China every time the latter causes an untoward incident in our territorial waters, rather than picking on a fictional film,” Pamalakaya’s chair, Fernando Hicap, told local media this week.\nChina is sensitive about portrayals of its territorial claims and has pressured companies, including hotel groups and airlines, to list Taiwan – a democratic and self-governing island – as part of China.\nThe freedom of expression group PEN America has previously raised concerns that Hollywood studios, keen to access the lucrative Chinese market, have changed or censored aspects of their films in an “effort to avoid antagonising Chinese officials”.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": {\n\"Title\": \"Studio defends Barbie movie after controversial map prompts Vietnam ban\",\n\"Description\": \"Warner Bros has described a map that appears in its coming Barbie movie as a “child-like crayon drawing” with no intended meaning, after Vietnam said it would ban the film after claiming the map depicted the disputed South China Sea.

The strike included drones and large-caliber firearms fired in the direction of Goris, Sotk, and Jermuk, according to the Armenian Defense Ministry.\nThe Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense responded with a statement acknowledging the strikes, but said the strikes are “small-scale” and “aim to ensure the security of Azerbaijan’s borders.”\nOn Monday, Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense accused Armenian forces of firing in small arms in the directions of the Novoivanovka settlement of Gadabay region and Husulu settlement of Lachin region near the border of the two countries. Armenia denied the allegations.\nIn 2020, the two countries clashed over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, a landlocked area between Eastern Europe and Western Asia that is populated and was controlled by ethnic Armenians but located in Azerbaijani territory. Hostilities ended after Armenian-backed separatists agreed to relinquish control over territories in the restive region.\nThe unrest in the region is decades old, dating back to the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the region, backed by Armenia, declared independence from Azerbaijan.

{"num":48,"Time":"24 October 2021","Title":"Who owns Scotland? Mapping the land in our towns and cities","Content":"Who owns Scotland? Mapping the land in our towns and cities\nPublished\n24 October 2021\nShare\nBy Martin Geissler\nBBC Scotland News\nScotland has the oldest system of land registration in the world but finding out exactly who owns the buildings, parks, landmarks and empty spaces in our towns and cities can be surprisingly difficult.\nIn the first of a new two-part BBC series Who Owns Scotland? I've been looking at the latest information on land ownership in urban Scotland and exploring not just what we do know, but also what we don't, and why.\nAncient records\nLand equals power. It's an equation as old as humanity and it's still true today.\nIf you own land it gives you economic, social and often political muscle. And the more of it you own, the more potential power you have.\nThat's why we've been keeping a pretty close eye on who owns what in our country for centuries.\nFor more than five hundred years, in fact, whenever anyone has bought a house - or land - the information has been stored away by Registers of Scotland. It's the oldest national land register of any country on earth and, gradually, that's become a problem.\nImage caption,\nRecords written on parchment are being digitised by the team at Registers of Scotland\nThe records - called the Sasine Register - are still stored in their original form - some are so ancient they're written on calfskin. There's lots of detail, in one form or another, but much of it's laid out in vague and outdated terms. Put together it paints a patchy and often baffling picture.\nKeeper of the Registers of Scotland, Jennifer Henderson, told me: \"If you think of land you would typically think of a map and being able to point to the map and say 'what is that piece of land and who owns it?'\n\"The Sasine Register doesn't have a map. Maps didn't really exist in the form we would understand them these days when it was first created.\n\"So it's actually quite difficult to point to a piece of land and say 'show me the Sasine Register that relates to the piece of land'.\"\nThe system needs a huge overhaul, and it's getting one. A modern digital land register is being created to give a clearer picture of who owns what but it's a massive job. Forty years after work started, less than half of the information has been transferred.\nNow though, the boosters have been fired on the project - the target is to have it finished within the next four years.\n\"Most typically, now when a property has been bought the new owner will be coming to us to register their purchase in the new digital land register. There is no longer the option to register in the Sasine Register,\" said Jennifer.\nMapping a multi-layered Scotland\nIn the first of two hour-long Who owns Scotland? programmes, I've been taking a look at what we're discovering as our national land register moves from parchment to gigabytes. And it turns out there are big gaps in our knowledge. Places which have, for whatever reason, slipped down between the folds of history.\nWe recruited the help of a digital mapping company, Lateral North, who used the data from the digital land register to create a multi-layered picture of modern Scotland.\n\"Although the process is slow and painful. It will be a really invaluable resource,\" said Tom Smith from Lateral North.\nThe data tells a fascinating story - geographical, obviously, but there are clear social and political aspects to it as well.\nImage caption,\nMaps were produced for the BBC Scotland programme, including this one showing public and private land ownership across Scotland\nWhen we talk about land here in Scotland, the conversation tends to get bogged down in highland estates and tweed clad grouse-shooters.\nWho owns Scotland?\nThe changing face of Scotland's landowners\nBut our programme delved deeper than that to look at the problem of vacant and derelict land and empty buildings and the direct link to poverty.\nThere are 47,000 long term empty homes in Scotland - the number's doubled since 2005 - bad news, given we're in the grip of a housing emergency.\nTo put the problem into perspective, if you were to place all the vacant and derelict land in Scotland together in one space, the area would be twice the size of the city of Dundee.\nDereliction and deprivation\nUsing information from the latest survey by Scotland's vacant and derelict land task force, the team at Lateral North put every one of those patches of derelict land, big and small, on to a new digital map.\nThe results are pretty stark, perhaps unsurprisingly the most concentrated areas of dereliction are spread through west central Scotland and down the Clyde coast. A clear visual explainer of the past half century in that part of the world. Traditional heavy industry has gone and the economic impact has spread through communities which used to thrum to the sound of pit wheels, shipyards and steelworks.\nImage caption,\nAnother map showed the correlation between deprived areas of Glasgow and sites which are vacant or derelict\nIn the city of Glasgow itself, the derelict properties seem to be spread out, spanning much of the city with no obvious pattern - until you add another layer. When you superimpose the areas of greatest deprivation onto the map, they sit almost precisely on top of the places where you find the most derelict land.\nTom Smith explained: \"When you add that layer (to our map) there does seem to be a direct correlation between the vacant and derelict land in Glasgow and its deprived areas.\"\nCall for laws to force sale of derelict sites\nDerelict land task force launched\nIf you don't know who owns a building or a piece of land, you can't take action to improve it. And even if you do, there's no way to force an owner to do something with it. That can hold back progress and, ultimately, deprive communities of a chance to grow.\nAnd the negative impact an adverse physical environment can have on a local community is something social scientists have long highlighted, according to Shona Glenn from the Scottish Land Commission.\n\"What you see when you look out the window in the morning, or when you come home from work at night, affects absolutely everything,\" she said.\n\"At the moment the balance of power really sits with landowners and we need to shift that so that communities and society at large have much more of that power.\"\nCommunities building futures\nImage caption,\nIn Huntly, in Aberdeenshire, local residents came together to set up a land development trust\nBut it's not all bad news. Not at all. In fact there's a growing trend of small communities taking matters into their own hands.\nSome have done so very successfully, like Huntly in Aberdeenshire, where the community trust bought a farm, put up a wind turbine and is now making plans to spend the millions of pounds it'll generate in the years ahead.\nDonald Boyd, from Huntly Development Trust, said: \"There's a feeling that it's difficult, in a world that is changing so fast, for a town like Huntly to keep up, so it's time for that to be turned around.\n\"We are harvesting the wind and we are growing a community.\"\nImage caption,\nDonald Boyd from the Huntly Development Trust explained how money generated from a community-owned wind farm is being used to help redevelop buildings and spaces\nThe town's old market square, pockmarked until recently with a depressing array of vacant shopfronts, is on the up again. The old department store, a substantial and prominent property, is now in community hands. Soon it'll house a café, a \"hot desking\" business centre and a cinema.\nAnd other Huntly properties are earmarked for takeover and turnaround, too. A major shift in the town's fortunes, generated largely by a bit of initiative and a lot of wind.\nIt's wonderful in its simplicity, so could that be the future for much of Scotland? Small community groups investing on their own doorsteps and taking more control of the way they live?\nCarolyn Powell, from the Trust, added: \"It's taking the future into your own hands as a community, rather than seeing other people doing things for you.\n\"What could be better than a community building its own future?\"\nScotland's land ownership is complex - it's grown over half a millennium after all - and there aren't many solutions that'll please everyone, but what is clear from the data we gathered and the maps we built is that the sooner we find out exactly who owns Scotland, the sooner we can work on solving the problems of the past.\nThe first of two programmes in the Who owns Scotland? series will be broadcast on the BBC Scotland channel at 21:00 on Sunday and available afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.\nRelated Topics\nPoverty\nHuntly\nGlasgow","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to land ownership and mapping in Scotland.

{"num":47,"Time":"SEPTEMBER 17, 2014","Title":"Factbox - Border rows, railways likely topics of China-India talks","Content":"By Reuters Staff\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in India on Wednesday as the two Asian giants take steps to boost commercial ties. China has pledged to invest billions of dollars in Indian railways, industrial parks and roads, but ties between the nuclear-armed nations have long been held back by distrust, mostly over their contested border.\nHere are some facts about India-China relations and issues likely to come up for discussion:\nBORDER DISPUTE\nChina beat India in a brief border war in 1962 and relations have remained sour over their still-disputed 3,500-km (2,200-mile) frontier.\nIndia has reported a rise in incursions by Chinese troops in recent years, charges China denies. Modi is expected to take a tougher stance with neighbouring countries, including China.\nIn the first such signal, Modi’s government eased restrictions on building roads and military facilities along the border to boost defence preparedness and close the gap on China’s superior transport network.\nVISAS\nChina often refuses to stamp visas on Indian passports from disputed territories and instead staples them to the page, a practice that infuriates India.\nChina has refused to issue visas to Indians from Arunachal Pradesh state, where the two countries fought the 1962 war, saying they do not need permission to travel to China. China claims the whole of Arunachal Pradesh, which it calls “South Tibet”.\nIn 2012, India started stamping its own map on visas it issues to holders of new Chinese passports that contain a map depicting disputed territory within China’s borders.\nThe visa issue is likely to be on the agenda during Xi’s visit.\nTRADE TIES\nChina is India’s largest trading partner, with two-way trade at about $66 billion last year. However, $51 billion (31.2 billion pounds) of that came from Chinese exports.\nIndia hopes new investments from China will partly help offset its trade deficit. China plans to invest about $7 billion in two industrial parks in western India, media reported this month.\nIndia will also ask its neighbour to set up manufacturing units for exports as it seeks to revive its economy,\nRAILWAYS\nIndia has the world’s fourth-longest rail network but has added only 11,000 km of track since independence in 1947. China, in comparison, added 14,000 km of track in the five years to 2011.\nChina is expected to pledge billions of dollars of investment in India’s rail network that can help reform the now-decrepit British-built system.\nNUCLEAR TIES\nIn 2013, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said the two countries would cooperate in civil nuclear energy. Leaders of the two energy-starved countries may discuss the possibility of a civil nuclear cooperation agreement, Indian officials said.\nChina has committed $6.5 billion to finance the construction of a major nuclear power project in Karachi, the financial hub of neighbouring Pakistan, India’s traditional foe. But Beijing might make a push to supply India with its new-generation reactors, The Hindu newspaper said.\nCompiled by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Nick Macfie\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the JSON-formatted response based on the provided news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": {\n        \"Border_dispute\": {\n            \"Summary\": \"The news is relevant to a border dispute between China and India.\",\n            \"Details\": \"China and India have a long-standing border dispute, with tensions over their contested 3,500-km frontier.

It compiled testimony from 38 Ethiopians who tried to cross the Yemen-Saudi border between March 2022 and June 2023, as well as four relatives or friends of migrants.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nHuman Rights Watch said attacks against groups of migrants, who used remote mountain tracks to cross into Saudi Arabia by foot, were \"widespread and systematic\" and that the \"killings are continuing\".\nA Saudi official, who did not provide their name, said on Monday in an emailed response to questions to the government's media office that HRW's allegations were \"unfounded and not based on reliable sources.\" Saudi authorities have also strongly denied allegations made by U.N. officials in 2022 that border guards systematically killed migrants last year.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe Ethiopian government in Addis Ababa and Houthi officials in Yemen did not respond to requests for comment Reuters sent early on Monday.\nA State Department spokesperson said the U.S. had raised concerns about the allegations in the report with the Saudi government and had urged it to undertake a thorough and transparent investigation.\nThere are an estimated 750,000 Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia, according to U.N. studies.

The news agency could not verify when they were filmed.\n\"I STARTED TO PRAY\"\nMustafa Sofian Mohammed, 22, told Reuters his group of 45 Ethiopians were nearing the end of a three-day walk to the border on July 10, 2022 when machine gun and grenade fire erupted from Saudi territory, partially severing his left leg above the ankle.\n\"I looked around to make sure if it was really happening ... That was when I realized I had no leg anymore and then I started to pray,\" said Mustafa, without specifying exactly where the incident took place. He said he tied a scarf around his injury and was later rescued by another group of men attempting the border crossing.\nSpeaking to Reuters in the eastern Ethiopian city of Harar, Mustafa said he was treated in Al Thawra Hospital in the Yemeni capital Sanaa and then flown to Addis Ababa, where his treatment was paid for by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Medical discharge papers from the Hallelujah Hospital in Addis seen by Reuters show he was treated there for an infected amputation wound and that he was admitted as an IOM-sponsored patient.\nMustafa, who was one of the migrants cited by HRW in its report, said he knew of only three others in his group who survived the attack: \"The rest are unreachable...only God knows what happened to them.\"\nSofian Mohammed Abdulla, Mustafa's 48-year-old father, confirmed his son's account. Reuters also reviewed video and photos provided by Mustafa of his partially severed leg he said were taken at hospital in Yemen shortly after the attack.

The answer has been the subject of diplomatic negotiations that started in 2018 and concluded with a compromise last year, but the details remain secret.\nWhen the refuge was built on a rocky outcrop in 1984, its 40 beds and long wooden tables were entirely in Italian territory. But now two-thirds of the lodge, including most of the beds and the restaurant, is technically perched in southern Switzerland.\nThe issue has come to the fore because the area, which relies on tourism, is located at the top of one of the world’s largest ski resorts, with a major new development including a cable car station being constructed a few metres away.\nAn agreement was hammered out in Florence in November 2021 but the outcome will only be revealed once it is rubber-stamped by the Swiss government, which will not happen before 2023.\n“We agreed to split the difference,” said Alain Wicht, the chief border official at Switzerland’s national mapping agency Swisstopo.\nHis job includes looking after the 7,000 boundary markers along landlocked Switzerland’s 1,200-mile (1,935km) border with Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Liechtenstein.\nWicht attended the negotiations, where both parties made concessions to find a solution. “Even if neither side came out winners, at least nobody lost”, he said.\nFreezing point climbs to record high above Swiss Alpine summits\nRead more\nWhere the Italian-Swiss border traverses Alpine glaciers, the frontier follows the watershed line. But the Theodul Glacier lost almost a quarter of its mass between 1973 and 2010. That exposed the rock underneath to the ice, altering the drainage divide and forcing the two neighbours to redraw around a 100-metre-long stretch of their border.\nWicht said such adjustments were frequent and were generally settled by comparing readings by surveyors from the border countries, without getting politicians involved.\n“We are squabbling over territory that isn’t worth much,” he said. But he added that this “is the only place where we suddenly had a building involved”, giving “economic value” to the land.\nHis Italian counterparts declined to comment “due to the complex international situation”.\nJean-Philippe Amstein, a former Swisstopo chief, said such disputes were typically resolved by exchanging parcels of land of equivalent surface area and value. In this case, “Switzerland is not interested in obtaining a piece of glacier”, he said, and “the Italians are unable to compensate for the loss of Swiss surface area”.\nWhile the outcome remains secret, the refuge’s caretaker, 51-year-old Lucio Trucco, has been told it will stay on Italian soil. “The refuge remains Italian because we have always been Italian,” he said. “The menu is Italian, the wine is Italian, and the taxes are Italian.”\nThe years of negotiation have delayed the refuge’s renovation – the villages either side of the border have not been able to issue a building permit. The works will therefore not be completed in time for the scheduled opening of a new cable car up the Italian side of the Klein Matterhorn mountain in late 2023. The slopes are only accessible from the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt.\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\nWhile some mid-altitude resorts are preparing for the end of Alpine skiing due to global heating, skiing is possible throughout the summer on the Zermatt-Cervinia slopes, even if such activities contribute to the glacier’s retreat.\n“That’s why we have to enhance the area here, because it will surely be the last one to die,” said Trucco.\nFor now, on Swisstopo’s maps, the solid pink band of the Swiss border remains a dashed line as it passes the refuge.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"A melting glacier in the Alps has shifted the border between Switzerland and Italy, putting the location of an Italian mountain lodge in dispute.

Diplomatic negotiations began in 2018, resulting in a compromise agreement in November 2021, but the details are still undisclosed and pending approval by the Swiss government in 2023. The dispute is of economic significance due to the tourism-dependent area and a new cable car station development.

When we see the two versions side by side, we can spot clues.”\nThe row between the two organisations dates back to December 1996, and concerns AA maps created as early as 1990. The AA, previously a non-profit body, was bought by the gas distribution firm Centrica two years ago.\nCentrica insisted the motoring club had “genuinely sought” to draw its own maps. However, Centrica’s director of information services, Matthew Thompson, said: “It is clear from our investigations that the AA’s processes were not as robust as they should have been. Centrica is very concerned that such a situation could have arisen and is now confident that it could not happen in the future.”\nYesterday’s settlement followed talks between Ms Lawrence and board-level executives from Centrica. Ms Lawrence said: “We spent a day together looking at various different sheets containing lots of different examples.”\nShe stressed that Ordnance Survey’s “fingerprints” did not extend to putting misleading features in maps: “There are some publishers who put deliberate mistakes in their maps. We don’t do that - it would mislead our customers. For us, it’s more about the style we use.”\nOrdnance Survey has a small team of copyright experts who are charged with scrutinising rival publications. The government agency has won several smaller cases in the past. In 1995, it won damages from two Norfolk publishers of tourist maps, Streetwise and Color Maps International. However, a spokesman said: “There’s never been anything in any shape or form of anything like this magnitude.”\nOrdnance Survey typically charges map-making organisations a few pence for each copy of any map printed using its information as source material. This can mean substantial bills for large publishers - the AA printed more than 300m copies of the maps and atlases in dispute.\nCompanies which do not make money from publishing maps, but which want to use Ordnance Survey maps on advertising material, are charged a fee of £45 a year.\nEstablished in the 18th century, Ordnance Survey was originally intended to provide the army with reliable maps to help put down rebellion and invasion. The organisation is still wholly owned by the government but it was recently granted “trading fund” status, which allows it to keep any profits for reinvestment in the business. It made profits of £12.7m last year, on sales of £99.6m.\nMs Lawrence said: “We are the master mapper of Britain. I would always wish to settle disputes like this in a businesslike way - we have to protect the intellectual property of both ourselves and our licensed partners.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to a dispute between Ordnance Survey and the Automobile Association (AA) over the copying of maps.

{"num":63,"Time":"Fri 16 Sep 2022 08.00 CEST","Title":"‘Never sleeps, never even blinks’: the hi-tech Anduril towers spreading along the US border","Content":"O\nn a hot May afternoon in southern California, near the border with Mexico, white-and-green border vehicles patrol the two-lane highway, black helicopters glide across the sky – and their latest companions, autonomous surveillance towers built by the tech defence company Anduril, peek over the ridges.\nOne Anduril tower, perched on a hill, has a clear view over the rusty brown border wall and into the Mexican town of Tecate. From here, it can detect people who climb over the wall and walk across the rugged landscape on the US side. Approach the hill and the camera atop the tower swivels toward you.\n‘Tale of two borders’: how a US Covid-era rule shapes fate of migrants\nRead more\nThese boulder-speckled hills of the Otay Mountain Wilderness of California have seen a sharp increase in border crossings in the last year, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Since March 2020, the US has expelled nearly 2 million people under Title 42, a pandemic-era rule that closes safe ports of entry to asylum seekers. Rather than wait in Mexico border towns, where they are at risk of kidnapping and sexual assault, migrants have instead attempted to reach US soil via dangerous routes – across deserts, mountains, rivers and oceans. More than 50 died in June after they were abandoned in a truck in the sweltering Texas heat.\nNow, as migrants cross the border, they are being watched full-time.\nPowered by solar panels, the Anduril towers operate day and night and can be set up in remote areas, including near military bases, airports and oil and gas pipelines, the company boasts on its website. The towers use an artificial intelligence system called Lattice to autonomously identify, detect and track “objects of interest”, such as humans or vehicles. The cameras pan 360 degrees and can detect a human from 2.8km away.\nWhen the system identifies an object, it sends a notification to border agents on their phone or desktop, and an image appears with bright green rectangles around the item, according to an Anduril promotional video. CBP has described these towers as “a partner that never sleeps, never needs to take a coffee break, never even blinks”.\nAlbert Miller walks by the new CBP camera tower near his property in Valentine, Texas. Photograph: The Washington Post\/Getty Images\nThe Anduril tower near Tecate is just one in a chain of hundreds of surveillance towers installed over the last two decades along the southern border. Not all are made by Anduril, but the company is making aggressive moves. According to a freedom of information request shared with the Guardian by Empower, CBP has a contract with Anduril to deploy a total of 189 autonomous surveillance towers on the south-west border.\nAll this new surveillance is driven by investment from big tech – specifically the billionaire PayPal co-founder and Trump supporter Peter Thiel, whose venture capital firm Founders Fund is a large investor in Anduril. The firm itself was set up in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, a former Facebook employee who identifies as a libertarian and has donated to a pro-Trump group. Luckey’s goal, he says in his bio on the company site, is to “radically transform the defence capabilities of the United States and its allies by fusing artificial intelligence with the latest hardware advancements”. Anduril, he told Wired, was named after a sword from The Lord of the Rings.\nInitially, the company pitched its towers to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) office in California, framing them as a cheap border security option. But in 2020, after a successful pilot project in the San Diego sector, the Trump administration approved a contract to deploy autonomous towers along the full length of the south-west border.\nMigrants risk death crossing treacherous Rio Grande river for ‘American dream’\nRead more\nBoasting of the towers’ effectiveness, Anduril’s chief revenue officer, Matt Steckman, told the Big Bend Sentinel that data showed a spike in alerts in the weeks after they are installed, then a decrease as smugglers appear to learn their locations and avoid them. “You’ll see traffic sort of squirting to the east and west,” Steckman said. Anduril did not respond to requests for comment.\nBorder patrol agents are certainly big fans. In April, a tower alerted agents to 171 migrants crossing the border into Texas, where agents detained them and sent them to CBP stations for processing. Agents also regularly share photos of large groups they intercept using the towers. In April, Chief Patrol Agent Sean McGoffin tweeted a photo of about a dozen people standing in the Texas desert. “Agents working the midnight shift were able to spot the group with the assistance from surveillance tower technology,” he wrote.\nThe Anduril towers fit into an expanding virtual wall, one that doesn’t just trace the border but also extends 100 miles into the US interior and includes highway checkpoints, predator drones, licence plate readers, facial recognition, ground sensors, and mobile surveillance mounted on vehicles, not to mention the digital tracking of migrants in detention. CBP is even piloting robot dogs to help agents patrol the border.\nThis expansion of border security is largely bipartisan: Trump attracted a lot of attention for trying to expand the physical wall and approving new surveillance, including Anduril’s towers, but the legacy of the last four administrations continues under Joe Biden. During the 2020 election campaign, Biden said building a physical wall had not deterred people from crossing and that “not another foot” of border wall would be built on his watch. Instead he has promised more DHS funding for “smart security” along the border. (In July, his administration did authorize new wall construction in Arizona, to close gaps in a border wall first approved by Trump.)\nAn aerial image shows steel bollard-style border wall barriers along the US-Mexico border between San Diego county and the Mexican city of Tecate, Baja California. Photograph: Patrick T Fallon\/AFP\/Getty Images\nBiden’s promise of more surveillance is being made good: CBP took $21m from Congress in the 2022 omnibus bill for autonomous surveillance towers, and its budget request for 2023 includes another $13.5m, which would be used to consolidate and support more than 700 surveillance towers, built by different companies, with varying degrees of functionality, along the northern and southern borders.\nCBP confirmed the plan to integrate the towers to the Guardian. In its draft budget request, it said that although the surveillance towers provide “significant situational awareness”, they rely too much on humans to detect people crossing the border. The goal now is to “seamlessly” combine the various operating systems of the different towers, to “easily control the towers and exploit useful data” as part of a long-term goal to use more automation to stop “threats”. The agency did not answer a list of questions regarding border surveillance.\nSheriffs in border communities argue that new technologies, like rescue beacons and the Anduril towers, are helping to save lives. “We have rescued quite a few people in distress because of new tools,” the Culberson county sheriff, Oscar Carrillo, told the Dallas Morning News.\nBut in August, members of Congress representing immigrant and border communities sent a letter to the House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, in which they expressed their concern over the harm the new border surveillance money would cause migrants, border residents, Indigenous communities, journalists and protesters. “We have strong reservations about funding more invasive technologies that are wasteful and insidious,” they wrote.\nPedro Rios, director of the US-Mexico border program for the American Friends Service Committee, a US-based social justice organisation, goes further. He calls the expansion of the digital wall “deadly” because it pushes people to take longer routes to evade detection, contributing to thousands of deaths at the southern border.\nRios lives in Chula Vista, a short drive from the border wall that slices across the sandy beach and into the Pacific Ocean, dividing Imperial Beach from Tijuana. Here, too, the ubiquitous border patrol agents drive their ATVs along muddy roads, helicopters hover above, and surveillance towers watch from higher ground.\nPedro Rios at the border. Photograph: Hilary Beaumont\nRios indicated a recently installed surveillance tower that was aiming its infrared camera at the crashing waves. He said smugglers carry migrants on jet skis and other marine vessels. “There’s been an increase in people that are crossing through smaller panga boats,” he said.\nIt has become significantly harder to cross the border without detection in the last decade, according to CBP data published by the American Immigration Council, and last year Maria Eugenia Chavez Segovia from Mexico City drowned along with two other people when a smuggler boat ran aground off Point Loma. Agents had already twice intercepted her on land and returned her to Mexico.\nRios argues the bipartisan project of hardening the border is killing people. He has spotted makeshift ladders hanging from the wall, and since 2019, when the DHS increased the height of the wall in southern San Diego from 17ft to 30ft, the number of severe injuries and deaths has increased. (In another reversal of Biden’s campaign promise, his administration announced in June that it would increase the height of the wall in other sections, too.)\nAs well as being deadly, increased surveillance infringes on the civil liberties of people living near the border, Rios believes, because they are often not consulted before new tech is deployed. He grew up in south San Diego, and identifies as a “fronterizo”, or borderlander, and has family on both sides of the frontier, but notes that CBP did not consult nearby residents before installing the infrared tower overlooking the beach. (CBP did not respond when asked to confirm.)\nAs a child, he said, he watched the borderlands from a swing in his back yard. Some of his classmates went on to become border patrol agents. Over the years, he says, he has witnessed a hardening of the border.\n“All of this area, where I grew up and call home, has undergone a process of militarization that continues to expand,” he said. “The use of surveillance technologies is an extension of that militarization.”\nThis militarization began in the 1990s under Bill Clinton, whose policy of “prevention through deterrence” aimed to make some areas of the border more like a fortress, in order to drive migration into harsher regions like the Arizona desert.\nThen, in 2005, George Bush established a multibillion-dollar program called the Secure Border Initiative Network (SBINet). It was an attempt to deploy a virtual fence along the border – including ground sensors to detect footsteps and vehicles, and radar and cameras mounted on towers – to gather data about “objects of interest” and send it to command centres, so border agents could better respond to migrant crossings. After a 2010 report by the Government Accountability Office found SBINet was over budget and didn’t deliver on its goals, Barack Obama cancelled it the following year – though the infrastructure remained.\nInstead, first Obama and then Trump funded a different program that they hoped would be an improvement: Integrated Fixed Towers, which consist of multiple cameras, radar, spotlights, laser illuminators and communications equipment mounted 180ft above the ground “to provide long-range, persistent surveillance” according to a CBP report. Built by defence tech company Elbit, the towers send data to a system called Torch, which it developed for the Israeli military. CBP has also deployed Mobile Video Surveillance Systems (MVSS), extendable towers with long-range infrared cameras that sit in the beds of trucks and are operated by border patrol agents.\nAll along, officials have claimed the new technology would deter migration and help migrant safety, yet nearly 10,000 migrants have died crossing the border in the last 25 years, and the deaths are increasing, according to CBP numbers obtained by the Washington Examiner. Sam Chambers, a geographer at the University of Arizona who studied SBINet, has found that people take longer, more strenuous paths to avoid surveillance towers. Between 2002 and 2016, he found the death rate increased by a factor of five.\nCars line up near the US-Mexico border. Photograph: Hilary Beaumont\nBut the new tech is big business. The border security market, globally, is now worth $45bn, according to a recent report by the market research company IMARC Group, as countries, not least the US, invest more in unmanned border security in response to global conflict, climate breakdown and displacement.\nIn the US, tech companies lobby heavily for these government contracts. Anduril, for example, has spent $520,000 so far this year and $930,000 last year on lobbying the US Senate, the House of Representatives and the DHS on budget decisions.\n“Migrants don’t have paid lobbyists in DC, but these military tech corporations do,” said Julie Mao, co-founder and deputy director of Just Futures Law, an immigration law project. “That is why the ‘smart wall’ messaging and border surveillance money is growing at such a high rate.”\nThe potential contracts are huge. According to analysis by Just Futures Law shared with the Guardian, CBP’s budget for 2023 includes about $1bn in border surveillance money, including for helicopters, border patrol vehicles and a mobile map-based application called a Team Awareness Kit (TAK) that helps agents see data gathered from towers and other sources in real time. Just Futures Law found that about 5,000 TAK units have been deployed to border patrol agents, primarily along the south-west border, and CBP plans to hand out nearly 20,000 kits total. Mao called it “deeply disappointing” that the Biden administration is investing in the “smart border wall”.\nAnduril, meanwhile, is moving to expand: it is attempting to raise $1.2bn to increase its valuation, TechCrunch reported.\nTo Rios, the framing of migration by media and politicians in war-like terms – such as “surge” or “invasion” – drives more investment in border security.\n“Once these private companies are able to respond to it with their fancy enforcement toys, that they can then market and sell to the government, that’s when we have the deployment of the towers and sensors and other gadgets,” he said.\n“As a way to cleanse their politics around border issues, the Democrats have pushed for the idea of a virtual or surveillance border wall, or smart technologies – that really aren’t that smart at all, because we see the impact to human life continues to be human suffering, injuries and death.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to border surveillance technology, specifically the deployment of autonomous surveillance towers built by the tech defense company Anduril along the US-Mexico border.

Greg Abbott Thursday, according to the letter, though there is time for the state to respond.\n“The State of Texas’s actions violate federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, present serious risks to public safety and the environment, and may interfere with the federal government’s ability to carry out its official duties,” the letter stated, citing a clause in the law that “prohibits the creation of any obstruction to the navigable capacity of waters of the United States, and further prohibits building any structure in such waters without authorization from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”).”\nThis is separate from the ongoing assessment of mistreatment of migrants, which the Justice Department described as “troubling reports.”\n“Texas has the sovereign authority to defend our border, under the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution,” Abbott said on Twitter. “We have sent the Biden Administration numerous letters detailing our authority, including the one I hand-delivered to President Biden earlier this year.”\nCNN has reached out the Texas Department of Public Safety but has not received a response.\nThe Justice Department has sued on border-related matters before. Last year, the Justice Department sued Arizona for placing shipping containers along the US southern border – a move taken by then-Republican Gov. Doug Ducey as an affront to Biden’s immigration policies. Arizona eventually agreed to remove the containers.\nThe news comes as more than 80 Democratic US lawmakers sent a letter to President Joe Biden Friday urging him to investigate Abbott’s “dangerous and cruel actions” on the southern border after a Texas state trooper blew the whistle regarding alleged inhumane treatment of migrants and Mexico’s top diplomat complained to Washington about Texas breaking two international treaties.\n“We write to express our profound alarm over border policies instituted by Texas Governor Greg Abbott that are putting asylum-seekers at serious risk of injury and death, interfering with federal immigration enforcement, infringing on private property rights, and violating U.S. treaty commitments with Mexico,” the letter states.\nThe inspector general for the Texas Department of Public Safety has received several additional complaints from DPS personnel on the front lines at the border about the treatment of migrants trying to enter the United States, three sources familiar with the investigation told CNN. Among the complaints are reports that Texas troopers were told to push back migrants into the Rio Grande and ordered not to give them water.\nIn a Tuesday joint statement with other Texas top officials, including Department of Public Safety Chief Steve McCraw, Abbott’s office said there have been no orders or directions given under Operation Lone Star that “would compromise the lives of those attempting to cross the border illegally.”\nThe effort, led by Rep. Joaquin Castro, also includes more traditionally conservative Democrats like Rep. Henry Cuellar.\nThe authors of the letter highlight that Abbott’s border initiative, known as Operation Lone Star, and says Abbott’s actions have “escalated in recent months,” detailing “sharp razor wire” in the Rio Grande, which is “creating death traps for migrants and violating U.S. treaty commitments with Mexico.”\n“The placement of razor wire and inflatable buoys in the Rio Grande River is potentially illegal and may violate multiple bilateral treaties between the United States and Mexico, including the Boundary Treaty of 1970 and the Mexican Water Treaty of 1944,” the letter states. “A similar attempt to create a makeshift border by Governor Ducey in Arizona was abandoned earlier this year after Department of Justice filed suit against the State of Arizona.”\nThe letter goes on to say that Abbott’s border initiative policies “pose a huge danger to migrants” and urges Biden to take action and “stop this horrific abuse of power.”\nVideo Ad Feedback\n'Shameful!': Texas lawmaker slams Abbott's latest immigration plan\n02:13 - Source: CNN\nBiden administration officials have grown increasingly concerned over recent months about Abbott’s measures along the Texas-Mexico border.\n“It’s making our job harder,” one Homeland Security official told CNN.\n“Governor Abbott’s dangerous and unlawful actions are undermining our effective border enforcement plan and making it hard for CBP to do their jobs of securing the border,” White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan said Friday. “The governor’s actions are cruel and putting both migrants and border agents in danger.”\nIn a significant development Wednesday that was first reported by CNN, the Justice Department said it’s assessing the situation along the Texas-Mexico border – marking an escalation from an administration that for months had stopped short of taking any actions against Texas.\n“The department is aware of the troubling reports, and we are working with DHS and other relevant agencies to assess the situation,” DOJ spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa told CNN on Wednesday.\nAn administration official said Abbott’s actions “are preventing Border Patrol agents from accessing the river, patrolling the area, and arresting individuals who attempt to enter the country unlawfully,” adding that agents have also had to cut through multiple layers of concertina wire to respond to medical emergencies.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about the Justice Department planning legal action against Texas over the placement of floating barriers in the Rio Grande as part of the state’s operation along the Texas-Mexico border.

Almost six out of 10 maps depict no borders, and another third include the green line but make no reference to Israel.\nIn Israeli textbooks, 76% of maps show no boundaries between Palestinian territories and Israel, and Palestinian areas are not labelled. \"Since these maps are generally presented as maps of Israel, the absence of borders between Israel and Palestine can be seen as implying that the Palestinian areas are part of the state of Israel,\" says the report, Victims of Our Own Narratives? Portrayal of the \"Other\" in Israeli and Palestinian School Books.\n\"It's almost comical. The idea of maps is to represent reality; here it represents fantasy,\" Bruce Wexler, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University, who led the study, told the Guardian. However, claims by both sides that they are demonised by the other were unfounded. \"Types of extreme demonising or dehumanising characterisations of 'the other' are absent from all the textbooks,\" he said.\nThe study, commissioned by the Council of Religious Institutions of the Holy Land, and funded and reviewed by the US state department, examined 3,000 texts, illustrations and maps in books used in Palestinian, Israeli state and Israeli ultra-Orthodox schools. All data was sent to Yale for analysis. The study was \"transparent, open, collaborative, rigorous and scientific,\" said Wexler, and produced four main findings:\nDehumanising or demonising is rare in both Palestinian and Israeli books.\nBoth Israeli and Palestinian books present \"unilateral national narratives\" that show the other as an enemy.\nInformation about the other's religions, culture, economic and daily activities is inadequate or absent.\nNegative bias in presentation of the other is significantly more pronounced in Israeli ultra-Orthodox and Palestinian school books than Israeli state books.\nMore than 90% of Palestinian children study textbooks produced by the Palestinian Authority. Among Israeli Jewish children, a majority attend state secular or state religious schools, with a significant minority attending ultra-Orthodox schools, which produce their own textbooks. Arabic books used in Israeli Arab schools, which are produced by the Israeli ministry of education, were not included in the study.\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority have both been accused of teaching violence and hatred, demonising the other, or using excessively negative depictions in children's education. In fact, this is extremely rare, according to the study. It found six examples in 9,964 pages of Palestinian textbooks \"that were rated as portraying the other in extreme negative ways other than as the enemy, and none of these six were general dehumanising characterisations of personal traits of Jews or Israelis\".\nHowever, there was evidence of selective presentation of historical events to reinforce national narratives. \"All the textbooks provide a unilateral national narrative that relentlessly describes the other as an enemy out to destroy or dominate the self,\" said Wexler. \"They present the self almost uniformly in positive terms, motivated only by self-defence and the pursuit of peace. They fail to describe information about the other's history, culture or religions, the type of information that would humanise.\"\n\"That is not a surprise to anyone who has studied textbooks in societies in conflict. Everywhere there are societies in conflict, the textbooks present a unilateral national narrative of this sort. The facts presented and the incidents described in the textbooks are not false, they're just selected from a unilateral perspective.\"\nThe books also fail to provide information about the other community. \"In this conflict, perhaps more than many others, this lack of recognition of the other's legitimate presence is a central obstacle to the respect and tolerance necessary for peace,\" the report says. \"It's hard to imagine Israelis and Palestinians living in peace without their children learning more about the religion of the other.\"\nIn general, according to Wexler, \"Israeli state school books present a less negative portrayal of the other, a more self-critical portrayal of themselves and provide more information about the other than the Palestinian books or the Israeli ultra-Orthodox books.\"\nThe study recommends Israeli and Palestinian ministries of education review the content of their textbooks. \"Education makes a difference in shaping expectations, it influences the way [people] view the world, said Wexler. \"You do not want to keep creating more and more obstacles [to peace] by training children in such a way that it obstructs the peace process.\"\nTextbook examples\n\"Israel is a young country and surrounded by enemies: Syria, Egypt, Jordan. And on every side... enemy states are hatching plots that are only waiting for the right time to be carried out.

With this claim, the Arabs completely ignore the historic connection of the Jews with the Land of Israel...

{"num":87,"Time":"JUNE 6, 2014","Title":"COLUMN-China's Nine Dash Line and the Law of the Sea: Kemp","Content":"By John Kemp\n(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)\nLONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - Territorial disputes over tiny islands and reefs in the South China Sea are poisoning relations between China and its neighbours in Southeast Asia.\n“In recent months, China has undertaken destabilising, unilateral actions asserting its claims in the South China Sea,” U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told an audience in Singapore last month.\n“(China) has restricted access to Scarborough Reef, put pressure on the long-standing Philippine presence at the Second Thomas Shoal, begun land reclamation activities at multiple locations, and moved an oil rig into disputed waters near the Paracel Islands,” Hagel complained at the Shangri-La Dialogue.\nThe defense secretary’s speech drew an angry response from China, which rebuked him for making “harsh, provocative” comments - signalling a further deterioration in the already strained relationship between the two countries.\nAccording to Hagel, the United States takes no position on territorial disputes in the South China Sea that pit China against Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.\nBut Washington will oppose any attempt to use “intimidation, coercion or the threat of force to assert those claims”. It will also oppose any attempt to restrict overflight and freedom of navigation.\nWashington says it wants to uphold a “rules-based order” in which disputes are settled through diplomacy, well-established norms and international law.\nHowever, all that is threatened by long-standing disputes over the ownership of two hundred or so tiny islands, islets, shoals and cays, reefs and rocks scattered across the area.\nThe various outcrops cover just a few square kilometres in total. Many are only just above the waterline even at low tide. But with them come claims to regulate navigation, fish, and drill for oil and gas over much more extensive areas.\nIn 1974, China and South Vietnam fought a short war over one island group. In recent years, there have been frequent and worsening low-level clashes in the South China Sea, severely straining relations between China and the other littoral states.\nGLOBAL CROSSROADS\nThe area is strategically vital. Hagel called the South China Sea “the beating heart of Asia-Pacific and a crossroads of the global economy”.\nThe South China Sea contains the world’s most important shipping lanes and sits astride supply routes essential to South Korea and Japan as well as China.\nMore than half of the world’s merchant shipping tonnage passes through the Straits of Malacca, Sunda and Lombok each year with nearly all of it continuing on through the South China Sea.\nAlmost a third of the world’s crude oil trade and half of its liquefied natural gas pass through the sea en route to China, Japan and South Korea.\nThe South China Sea contains rich fishing grounds that have been customarily exploited by all the coastal states.\nThe area is also thought to contain oil and gas deposits. There are several large sedimentary basins, though estimates of the amount of recoverable oil and gas they contain vary widely.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration puts proven and probable reserves in the area at 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is small but significant (“South China Sea”, February 2013).\nHowever, there could be another 5-22 billion barrels of oil and 70-290 trillion cubic feet of gas waiting to be discovered, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (“Assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources of Southeast Asia”, 2010).\nChina’s oil companies and government agencies have published even higher estimates of the oil and gas likely to be found in the region.\nNINE DASH LINE\nChina claims sovereignty over all the islands, rocks and reefs in the four main groups, while Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei each claim some of them.\nMuch of the dispute revolves around the “Nine Dash Line”, which appears on China’s official maps and encompasses almost the entire South China Sea.\n(For a map, click: link.reuters.com\/kus89v)\nThe Nine Dash Line made its first appearance in official atlases issued in 1948, though the territorial claims on which it rests go back much further. It has been subject to only minor modifications since then.\nThe number of dashes - which roughly indicate the boundary - has varied between nine and 11 at various times and currently stands at 10 after a new dash was added east of Taiwan in 2013.\nChina has included the Nine Dash Line on illustrative maps used in disputes with the other coastal states, and it is now used in passports issued by the People’s Republic. But the exact status of the line remains “ambiguous”, according to Euan Graham at Britain’s Royal United Services Institute (“China’s new map: just another dash?” September 2013).\nThe latest edition of the official atlas designates the line as a national boundary and uses identical shading to the lines on China’s land borders. Exactly what China is claiming, however, remains somewhat mysterious, even to experts.\nAccording to one leading Chinese maritime expert, the line indicates the island groups over which China claims sovereignty, rather than laying claim to the sea area itself. It is a sort of envelope around the islands China considers to be part of its sovereign territory.\nGao Zhiguo, China’s judge on the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, explains that the Nine Dash Line “has become synonymous with a claim of sovereignty over the island groups that always belonged to China and with an additional Chinese claim of historical rights of fishing, navigation, and other maritime activities (including the exploration and exploitation of resources, mineral or otherwise) on the islands and in the adjacent waters”.\nWriting in the American Journal of International Law, Gao suggests the line may have “a residual function as potential maritime delimitation boundaries”. It was, Gao suggests, an early attempt to define China’s continental shelf (“The Nine Dash Line in the South China Sea: History, Status and Implications”, 2013).\nNonetheless, China accepts that any rights to fishing, oil and gas extraction, exclusive economic zones, and power to restrict navigation in the neighbouring sea stemming from ownership of the islands are governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\nLAW OF THE SEA\nThe convention, which was opened for signature in 1982 and entered into force in 1994, sets out detailed rules defining territorial seas, navigation rights, exclusive economic zones, the extent of the continental shelf and delimiting maritime boundaries. It also contains a range of binding procedures for settling disputes.\nChina and all the states around the shores of the South China Sea have signed UNCLOS and are bound by its provisions. Some commentators have expressed hope that UNCLOS could be used to settle disputes between China and its neighbours peaceably.\n“Many hope that international law will impose a resolution,” according to Elizabeth Economy and Michael Levi at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations. “This would, however, be a strong departure from historical precedent,” they note sceptically (“By all means necessary: how China’s resource quest is changing the world”, 2014).\nIn 2009, Vietnam and Malaysia submitted a joint claim to the continental shelf under UNCLOS. In 2013, the Philippines requested binding arbitration in its territorial dispute with China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. China has refused to accept arbitration.\nThere are several problems with trying to rely on UNCLOS. First, the dispute settlement provisions of UNCLOS may not apply in this case.\nOn signing the convention, as well as on ratification, and afterwards, countries can opt out of the binding dispute settlement processes relating to certain sea boundary disputes (Article 298). China exercised that opt-out in relation to maritime boundaries in 2006.\nMore controversially, on ratifying the treaty in 1996, China declared that it “reaffirms its sovereignty over all its archipelagos and islands as listed in article 2 of the Law of the People’s Republic of China on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone”.\nSecond, UNCLOS deals with issues of maritime law and rights in the seas around the islands. It cannot settle disputes about who owns the islands themselves.\nThird, unlike the later Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, signed in 1994, UNCLOS lacks an effective enforcement mechanism.\nFinally, it is hard to see how attempts to resolve the disputes purely through commercial and legal means can succeed if they do not recognise the broader strategic realities, as Economy and Levi point out.\nSVALBARD TREATY\nThe solution must be political and diplomatic, a position all sides seem to recognise.\n“Attempts to resolve tensions that focus purely on commerce and law and ignore broader strategic realities may not result in stable outcomes,” according to Economy and Levi.\nChina’s Gao reaches a similar conclusion: “China relies heavily on its long and overwhelming history to justify its title to territorial sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction in the South China Sea, other claimant states repeatedly stress the imperative of their rights under UNCLOS. Nonetheless the solution perhaps lies somewhere in the middle.”\nThe compromise solution is shared exploitation of the resources. “Pending a solution acceptable to the littoral states concerned, the parties would do well to shelve the disputes and work toward a temporary solution involving joint development,” Gao wrote.\nUNCLOS itself encourages the use of practical, provisional arrangements in the case of disputes.\nThere are precedents for shared development of resources. In 2008, China and Japan agreed to develop jointly the Chunxiao gas fields in a disputed area of the East China Sea, though that pact has since been derailed by the rising tensions between the two countries.\nA more hopeful example is the archipelago of Svalbard\/Spitsbergen in the Arctic.\nThe 1920 Spitsbergen Treaty recognised Norway’s sovereignty, but granted all signatories equal access to hunting and fishing rights on the islands and in their territorial waters, as well as the exploitation of minerals found on the islands.\nSomething similar would be desirable in the South China Sea. Sovereignty over the islands could be split or put to one side, while the coastal states agree to joint development of fishing, oil and gas resources.\nIf the solution is fairly clear, the harder question is how to get there. In that respect, the U.S. position and Hagel’s speech have done more harm than good.\nThe U.S. position (no stance on sovereignty, but an insistence on legal processes to resolve the dispute) is particularly unhelpful since there is no real legal answer.\nThe defense secretary was speaking to a domestic audience and regional allies, trying to reassure them that Washington will stand up to what some see as bullying by China. But singling out China for blame was unhelpful if the United States wants to play a constructive role in resolving the dispute.\nIn the end, Washington will have to use its influence with all the regional states, including its allies, to push them towards a diplomatic and political compromise.\nCoastal states must set aside the ownership question and focus on how jointly to exploit the resources and regulate shipping in the area peaceably, in accordance with their other international commitments.

Visiting Kosovo, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sounded an optimistic note.\n“I am personally convinced that both leaders, (Israeli) Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu and (Palestinian) President (Mahmoud) Abbas, very much see it as in their respective interest to return to and proceed with direct negotiations,” she said.\nThe Palestinians say they will not resume the U.S.-backed talks until Israel halts settlement building on occupied land where they aim to found a state. An Israeli freeze on new home building in the occupied West Bank expired on September 26.\nFREEZE\nNetanyahu said on Monday he would be willing to request another freeze from his cabinet if the Palestinians recognised Israel as a Jewish state.\nHe said it would be a “trust-building step,” while some Palestinian and Israeli commentators questioned whether the proposal was only a ploy to try to shift blame onto the Palestinians should the peace process collapse.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nAnalysis: \"Jewish state\" demand complicates intricate equation\nChristians can be peacemakers in Middle East-rabbi\nThe Palestinians ruled out the idea -- something they see as a major concession that would be tantamount to political suicide for a leadership whose credibility has already been badly damaged by the failure of past peace talks.\nClinton told reporters that “both sides are testing out a lot of different approaches, offers, requests between each other.”\nOn Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokesman P. J. Crowley said Netanyahu had “offered his thoughts on both what he’s willing to contribute to the process, and what he thinks he needs for his people out of the process.”\nWashington, Crowley said, hoped the Palestinians would do the same.\n“We recognize that Israel is, as it says itself, is a Jewish state,” he added.\nAbed Rabbo’s demand for a map echoed Abbas’s call for clear terms of reference for the peace talks.\nNetanyahu’s predecessor as prime minister, Ehud Olmert, has said he showed Abbas a map offering him 93.5 to 93.7 percent of the West Bank, with the difference made up by a proposed land swap of 5.8 percent and a safe-passage corridor between the territory and the Gaza Strip.\nBut the Palestinians fear Netanyahu has no intention of allowing the establishment of a viable state they seek in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem, which Israel also captured in 1967 and annexed, as their capital.\n“We are ready to recognize, once again, the state of Israel if Washington gives us a map of the borders of that state so we know if they include our land and homes in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem,” Abed Rabbo said.\nThe PLO recognised the state of Israel in 1993 at the outset of the peace process. At the same time, Israel also recognised the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.\nAdditional reporting by Ali Sawafta; Editing by Charles Dick\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the JSON format response based on the provided news article:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to border disputes due to digital mapping.

Israel is already extracting gas from offshore fields, while Lebanon, facing a severe economic crisis, is looking for potential gas reserves in its own waters. These negotiations follow several diplomatic efforts, with the involvement of Washington, and are distinct from recent agreements between Israel and other Arab nations to establish full relations.\"\n}","From":"reuters.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/lebanon-israel-talks-idUKL1N2HX1AS","query_name":"updated_file_Border_disputes_due_to_digital_mapping.xlsx"}

In particular, our treaty reflects the importance of the UN convention on the law of the sea. As a maritime trading nation, Australia will continue to be a staunch supporter of UNCLOS and its processes.”\nBishop said the treaty was an important step in the development of a “rich, shared resource”, the Greater Sunrise gas field, which was crucial to Timor-Leste’s future.\nBishop also addressed accusations from Gusmao that the conciliation committee had shown bias and used inferior technical expertise, putting forward a formal recommendation against convention, which favoured Australia.\nBishop noted each country recommended two members of the commission and all “played an objective, forthright and rigorously independent role”.\nOn Tuesday, José Ramos Horta, a former president and prime minister of Timor-Leste, told the Guardian the development of Greater Sunrise was “an absolute necessity for the future wellbeing of this country”.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"Australia and Timor-Leste have signed a historic maritime border treaty in New York.

REUTERS\/Ronen Zvulun\/File Photo\nThat data, says Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, is the key to the deal, and may see its first tangible revenue stream through mapping technology.\nSelf-driving car data could bring in $450-$750 billion globally by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company, with such wide-reaching applications as shopping inside cars, vehicles as entertainment centers, or better city planning based on data.\n“Tech firms are hunting for ever more data. Miles = data,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note on Monday to clients after Intel announced the deal.\nTo be sure, before self-driving cars dominate the road, unresolved debates over who owns the data, how it can be shared and whether drivers can opt out over privacy concerns need to be ironed out. It is also too early to gauge whether Mobileye will win a data race that has barely begun.\nStill, Mobileye says it has 80 percent of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane, and Intel sees that as a start.\n“That definitely helps fill the revenue opportunity for the next few years while the industry and carmakers move to full automation,” Kathy Winter, general manager of Intel’s automated driving unit, told Reuters.\n“When we look forward, everything we do together will be learning from the data coming off these vehicles.”\nMobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management (REM), which feeds data about a vehicle's surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time. Mobileye already has deals with BMW and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, which mean those carmakers' vehicles can help source the data beginning in 2018, and share in the revenue.\nIntel already owns 15 percent of HERE, a digital map consortium made up of Germany’s automakers, which makes the high-definition maps that are updated by Mobileye’s REM.\nGiven there are already 15 million cars with its cameras on the road, Mobileye has “significant early mover advantage” in the high definition mapping space, Jefferies analyst David Kelley wrote to investors last month.\n“This purchase validates that this data layer is valuable,” Stefan Heck, the CEO of Nauto, a Silicon Valley start-up also using a car vision system to collect and process data, told Reuters.\nNeedham and Co, which sees a total ADAS market of $8.5 billion by 2022, surmised mapping data could be paid per mile by an autonomous car provider, while real-time data on traffic, hazards, or parking spots could be sold to mapping companies.\nPLAYING CATCH-UP?\nGiven the expense and complicated nature of autonomous driving systems, most carmakers rely heavily on suppliers like Mobileye for key technology.\nTesla Inc, however, once a buyer of Mobileye’s camera system, has developed an in-house integrated vision-based system more reliant on radar than cameras, part of its push to be less reliant on suppliers.\nTraditional suppliers like Germany’s Continental or Sweden’s AutoLiv, who have steered clear of the advanced navigation systems inside cars, may be too late to play “catch-up” to Intel, said Evercore’s Chris McNally in a note.\nOne issue still to be hammered out is who owns the data a self-driving car collects and whether the passenger has a privacy right.\nWhile drivers may not be spooked by access to their aggregated mapping and navigation data, they may balk at sharing personal data and preferences, McKinsey wrote last year.\nSome data deserves to be shared, Winter argued in a February blog. “Every autonomous car out there shouldn’t have to find the same pothole and log it,” she wrote.\nReporting By Alexandria Sage; editing by Peter Henderson, Bernard Orr\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"Intel's $15.3 billion proposed acquisition of Israel's Mobileye is driven by the potential revenue from self-driving car data.

Wales is Wales is Wales.\nNow search for “Palestine” to get a sense of how fraught cartography has become in the digital age. This time we get a dotted grey line, no red tinting and no “Palestine”.\nCue outrage in the occupied territories. “The move is designed to falsify history, geography as well as the Palestinian people’s right to their homeland,” the Forum of Palestinian Journalists said in a statement. There’s now a hashtag (#PalestineIsHere) and a pre-existing online petition has more than 260,000 supporters.\nStrong stuff, but mostly wrong. Google says there has never been a “Palestine” label, although the company conceded that a bug had removed labels for “West Bank” and “Gaza Strip”. They now show up with the full red-tint treatment.\nAnd the dotted line? Simply one of the tools of digital mappers, who are frequently damned however they depict a contested globe. Here’s a neat example. Look at the Crimean peninsula on Google Maps UK – it’s separated from Ukraine by a dark-grey dotted line to mark a disputed border. Look at it on Ukrainian Google Maps and the dotted line is light-grey, of the sort used to demarcate states. On Google Maps Russia? A solid black country border, showing Crimea as part of the country.\n“I guess, naively perhaps, we hoped we could have one global map of the world that everyone used, but politics is complicated,” Ed Parsons, Google’s geospatial technologist, said in 2014.\n“We’re seeing a move towards what we call agnostic cartography,” says Steven Feldman, a digital mapping consultant who has written about the issue. “Mappers have to try to represent different points of view where they can, but sometimes have to make a choice: maps that comply with local laws, or no maps at all.”\nThe penalty can be harsh. In May, India drafted a law that would allow a fine of up to 1bn rupees (£11.5m) for anyone who published “wrong or false topographic information” about its disputed borders with Pakistan and China. The bill soon disappeared, but Google already complies, showing dotted lines outside India and solid lines inside.\nThe stakes can get higher still. In 2010, faulty Google data briefly gave a chunk of Costa Rica to neighbouring Nicaragua. Troops were deployed before a correction eased tensions. “Google maps are of very high quality,” the company said in a statement that could be applied to the latest dispute before it goes any further, “[but] by no means should they be used as a reference to decide military actions between two countries.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about disputes related to digital cartography.

MaxMind, based in Massachusetts, allows companies to find out the location of the computers used by individuals to access their websites.\nAccording to the complaint, the husband and wife team dealt with five years of “digital hell” after moving into the property in Butler County, Kansas, in 2011.\nThe couple had been drawn to the farm because it was close to the nursing home where Theresa’s mother was being cared for and the school that their two sons attended. The landlord also allowed the sons to hunt and fish on the surrounding 620 acres of land.\nHow it feels to be at the centre of an internet kidnapping conspiracy\nRead more\nThe first week after they moved in, two deputies from the Butler County sheriff’s department came to their house looking for a stolen truck, something that would happen again and again over the subsequent years.\n“The plaintiffs were repeatedly awakened from their sleep or disturbed from their daily activities by local, state or federal officials looking for a runaway child or a missing person, or evidence of a computer fraud, or call of an attempted suicide,” the complaint said. At one point, James Arnold was reported for holding girls at the residence for the purpose of making child abuse films.\nFor half a decade the family was mystified about why this was happening until April this year when Fusion’s Kashmir Hill revealed the truth.\nIt all came down to glitch in the MaxMind’s IP address mapping database.\nIP, or Internet Protocol, addresses are unique identifiers associated with computers or networks of computers connected to the internet. Through its GeoIP product, MaxMind matches IP addresses with their assumed geographic location, and sells that information to companies so they can use it to, for example, show targeted advertising or send someone a cease and desist letter if they are illegally downloading films.\nIP mapping isn’t an exact science and so MaxMind assigns a default address when it can’t identify its true location. That address just happened to be the Arnolds’ property, a remote farm that is located slap-bang in the middle of America.\nMore than 600 million IP addresses are associated with their farm and more than 5,000 companies are drawing information from MaxMind’s database.\nIt wasn’t just police who turned up on the Arnolds’ doorstep. Angry business owners would turn up claiming someone at the residence was sending their business thousands of emails and clogging their computer systems. Other people became convinced that someone living at the residence was responsible for internet scams.\nThe state of cyber security: we’re all screwed\nRead more\nIn 2013, the Butler county sheriff’s department ran a background check on the family because of all of the suspicious activity that seemed to be taking place. Police told the Arnolds that that there was a LDNS (local domain name server) on their property and that the sheriff’s department received “weekly reports about fraud, scams, stolen Facebook accounts, missing person reports, suicide threats from the Veterans Association”.\nThere was no such server on the property, say the Arnolds; it was all down to MaxMind’s mapping error.\nThe glitch had been in effect since 2002 and, as explained in Fusion’s article, had affected the property’s previous tenants as well.\n“As a result of the defendant’s reckless and grossly negligent conduct, the plaintiffs have sustained great emotional distress, fear for their safety and humiliation,” said the complaint.\nThe Arnolds are seeking damages in excess of $75,000.\n“My clients have been through digital hell. The most vile accusations have been made against them – such as that they’ve been involved in child pornography. What impact would it have on your life if someone accused you of being in child pornography? Obviously it’s horrendous,” said the Arnolds’ attorney Randall Rathbun, who said that the police visits continued “up until last month”.\nMaxMind has since changed its default location, Rathbun said, but “there’s been no indication on our end that things have changed”.\nThe company said it was aware of the lawsuit but does not comment on pending litigation.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": {\n        \"Title\": \"Kansas family sues mapping company for years of 'digital hell'\",\n        \"Summary\": \"A Kansas family is suing the digital mapping company MaxMind after experiencing five years of problems due to a glitch in MaxMind's IP address mapping database.

Both countries are working toward their own goals of being leaders of the global south.”\nBorders have been a source of friction between New Delhi and Beijing for decades, and agitation in the region has spilled into war before, ending in Chinese victory in 1962. In the ensuing years, an ill-defined de facto border called the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has split the world’s most populous nations.\nTensions between the two countries soured significantly in 2020 after a deadly brawl in the Galwan Valley, close to Aksai Chin, an area controlled by China but claimed by both countries. Tensions have been simmering since and flared up last December when a clash between troops from both sides in the Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh resulted in minor injuries.\nPressure on Modi\nWhile the tensions between Beijing and New Delhi play out, politicians from India’s main opposition Congress party have criticized Modi for downplaying the border issue.\n“China is a habitual offender when it comes to renaming and redrawing maps of territories belonging to other countries,” said Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge. “(The) Modi government must ensure that the illegal Chinese occupation of 2,000 square kilometers of Indian territory along the LAC must end.”\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, lawmaker Rahul Gandhi, said: “I have been saying for years that the prime minister was lying when he said not one inch of land was lost in Ladakh.”\n“All of Ladakh knows that China has grabbed our land. This map issue is very serious … the prime minister should speak about it,” he added.\nModi has largely avoided speaking publicly on the border issue, going as far as saying on live television shortly after the deadly 2020 clashes that, “No one has intruded and nor is anyone intruding.”\nHowever, India has taken several steps to push back against perceived threats from China, including banning social media platform TikTok and other well-known Chinese apps, saying they pose a “threat to sovereignty and integrity,” while also moving to block Chinese telecoms giants Huawei and ZTE from supplying its 5G network.\nAmid rising nationalism in both countries, concerns in New Delhi of Beijing’s increasing assertiveness have also bolstered India’s relationship with the United States, including via the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad – a grouping of Japan, the US, India and Australia widely seen as a counterweight to China.\nChina earlier this year boycotted a G20 tourism meeting hosted by India in the Himalayan territory of Jammu and Kashmir, citing its opposition “to holding any kind of G20 meetings in disputed territory.” India and Pakistan both claim the disputed Kashmir region in its entirety.\nCNN’s Nectar Gan contributed reporting.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news article in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": [\n    \"China published a new version of its national map, leading to objections from neighboring countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, and India.\",\n    \"The Philippines objected to the map due to its inclusion of a dashed line around contested areas of the South China Sea, which was the subject of an international tribunal ruling in 2016 in favor of Manila.\",\n    \"India also protested the inclusion of its state, Arunachal Pradesh, and the disputed Aksai-Chin plateau in Chinese territory.\",\n    \"Malaysia dismissed China's claims, maintaining its position on rejecting foreign claims to sovereignty over its maritime features.\",\n    \"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin described the map revisions as a routine exercise of sovereignty in accordance with the law.\",\n    \"Tensions between China and India have been ongoing, with efforts to deescalate tensions and resolve the border issue.\",\n    \"The map dispute is part of broader geopolitical tensions in the region as China seeks to assert its dominance and neighboring countries push back against perceived territorial claims.\",\n    \"China's actions have led to concerns and increased cooperation between India and the United States, including through the Quad grouping.\"\n  ]\n}\nIn this analysis, the news is relevant to the topic of territorial disputes related to China's new national map.

REUTERS\/Michaela Rehle\/Files\nIn August last year, German carmakers BMW, Audi and Mercedes, agreed to pay 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) to buy Nokia’s high definition maps business, in a step to develop self-driving cars.\nThe deal closed in December and the German auto makers Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW started negotiations with new potential members, Zetsche said in an interview embargoed for Sunday.\n“If there are individual companies that are already raising their finger, then this is fast and pleasing. I do not think it will take very long until the first company gives a binding commitment to join,” Zetsche said at a Mercedes-Benz driving event in Portugal.\nThe HERE mapping business needs additional investments to make it viable for use as a navigation tool for self-driving cars. Having more carmakers join the consortium will potentially spread the cost across more members and could improve the volume of live traffic information being fed to the map from vehicles on the road.\nLast week carmakers Renault-Nissan, and supplier Continental said they were considering taking a stake in the HERE mapping consortium.\nIntelligent mapping systems like HERE’s are the basis on which self-driving cars, linked to wireless networks, can perform functions such as recalculating a route to the nearest electric charging station or around a traffic jam or accident.\nTalks with third parties only started in the past two months because the consortium waited until the deal closed before talking to other partners, Zetsche said. Having only three members in the consortium made negotiations to close the deal simpler, Zetsche said.\n“Interest will not only be limited to Renault-Nissan and Continental,” Zetsche added.\nSelf-driving and connected car services could become a $50 billion market, analysts at Exane BNP Paribas have estimated. Germany’s carmakers decided to club together to bid for the asset to accelerate plans for self-driving cars after Internet rival Alphabet unveiled a prototype autonomous vehicle.\nNow Daimler is ready to expand the business which will form the basis for interactive maps which include live data on traffic flows gathered by thousands of sensors on BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz vehicles.\n“It is clear that we want to aggressively expand this platform, we will make the means available to do this,” Zetsche said.\nThere are talks with the telecommunications industry about how to spread the availability of ultra-high-speed 5G networks, Zetsche said.\nMercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi are also evaluating whether their cooperation on maps can be broadened, Zetsche said.\n“When it concerns navigation, we have broadly identical needs. Setting communication standards, which language we should speak and what signals we send, we can decide together,” Zetsche said.\nDaimler is on the lookout for software and information technology specialists to help develop its digital businesses, including through further takeovers.\n“To get access to the right resources we will continue making acquisitions,” Zetsche said, explaining that there are currently no live talks for a deal.

REUTERS\/Ronen Zvulun\nThat data, says Intel Corp INTC.O Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, is the key to the deal, and may see its first tangible revenue stream through mapping technology.\nSelf-driving car data could bring in $450-$750 billion globally by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company, with such wide-reaching applications as shopping inside cars, vehicles as entertainment centres, or better city planning based on data.\n“Tech firms are hunting for ever more data. Miles = data,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note on Monday to clients after Intel announced the deal.\nTo be sure, before self-driving cars dominate the road, unresolved debates over who owns the data, how it can be shared and whether drivers can opt out over privacy concerns need to be ironed out. It is also too early to gauge whether Mobileye will win a data race that has barely begun.\nStill, Mobileye says it has 80 percent of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane, and Intel sees that as a start.\n“That definitely helps fill the revenue opportunity for the next few years while the industry and carmakers move to full automation,” Kathy Winter, general manager of Intel’s automated driving unit, told Reuters.\n“When we look forward, everything we do together will be learning from the data coming off these vehicles.”\nMobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management (REM), which feeds data about a vehicle's surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time. Mobileye already has deals with BMW and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, which mean those carmakers' vehicles can help source the data beginning in 2018, and share in the revenue.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nBosch sticks to own technology in face of Intel-Mobileye merger\nIntel already owns 15 percent of HERE, a digital map consortium made up of Germany’s automakers, which makes the high-definition maps that are updated by Mobileye’s REM.\nGiven there are already 15 million cars with its cameras on the road, Mobileye has “significant early mover advantage” in the high definition mapping space, Jefferies analyst David Kelley wrote to investors last month.\n“This purchase validates that this data layer is valuable,” Stefan Heck, the CEO of Nauto, a Silicon Valley start-up also using a car vision system to collect and process data, told Reuters.\nNeedham and Co, which sees a total ADAS market of $8.5 billion by 2022, surmised mapping data could be paid per mile by an autonomous car provider, while real-time data on traffic, hazards, or parking spots could be sold to mapping companies.\nPLAYING CATCH-UP?\nGiven the expense and complicated nature of autonomous driving systems, most carmakers rely heavily on suppliers like Mobileye for key technology.\nTesla Inc TSLA.O, however, once a buyer of Mobileye's camera system, has developed an in-house integrated vision-based system more reliant on radar than cameras, part of its push to be less reliant on suppliers.\nTraditional suppliers like Germany's Continental CONG.DE or Sweden's AutoLiv ALV.N, who have steered clear of the advanced navigation systems inside cars, may be too late to play \"catch-up\" to Intel, said Evercore's Chris McNally in a note.\nOne issue still to be hammered out is who owns the data a self-driving car collects and whether the passenger has a privacy right.\nWhile drivers may not be spooked by access to their aggregated mapping and navigation data, they may balk at sharing personal data and preferences, McKinsey wrote last year.\nSome data deserves to be shared, Winter argued in a February blog. “Every autonomous car out there shouldn’t have to find the same pothole and log it,” she wrote.\nReporting By Alexandria Sage; editing by Peter Henderson, Bernard Orr\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"The news is about Intel's proposed acquisition of Israel's Mobileye and its focus on utilizing data from self-driving cars, especially in the context of mapping technology.

{"num":6,"Time":"Thu 23 Mar 2017 17.19 CET","Title":"Boston public schools map switch aims to amend 500 years of distortion","Content":"When Boston public schools introduced a new standard map of the world this week, some young students’ felt their jaws drop. In an instant, their view of the world had changed.\nThe USA was small. Europe too had suddenly shrunk. Africa and South America appeared narrower but also much larger than usual. And what had happened to Alaska?\nIn an age of “fake news” and “alternative facts”, city authorities are confident their new map offers something closer to the geographical truth than that of traditional school maps, and hope it can serve an example to schools across the nation and even the world.\nNew map reveals shattering effect of roads on nature\nRead more\nFor almost 500 years, the Mercator projection has been one of the most popular maps of the world, common in atlases and pinned on peeling school walls.\nGerardus Mercator, a renowned Flemish cartographer, devised his map in 1569 to aid navigation along colonial trade routes by drawing straight lines across the oceans. An exaggeration of the whole northern hemisphere, his depiction made North America and Europe bigger than South America and Africa. He also placed western Europe in the middle of his map.\nMercator’s distortions affect continents as well as nations. For example, South America is made to look about the same size as Europe, when in fact it is almost twice as large, and Greenland looks roughly the size of Africa when it is actually about 14 times smaller. Alaska looks bigger than Mexico and Germany is often right in the middle of the picture, not to the north – because publishers frequently cropped off Antarctica and then re-centered the Mercator map, resulting in the equator appearing two-thirds of the way down the image.\nThree days ago, Boston’s public schools began phasing in the lesser-known Peters projection, which cuts the US, Britain and the rest of Europe down to size. Teachers put contrasting maps of the world side by side and let the students study them.\nThe Mercator projection shifts the equator and represents Greenland and Africa as roughly the same size; Greenland in fact is 14 times smaller. Photograph: Buyenlarge\/Getty Images\nNatacha Scott, director of history and social studies at Boston public schools, said it was “interesting to watch the students saying ‘Wow’ and ‘No, really? Look at Africa, it’s bigger’”.\n“Some of their reactions were quite funny,” she added, “but it was also amazingly interesting to see them questioning what they thought they knew.”\nIndividual schools in the US have used the Peters maps, Scott said, adding: “We believe we are the first public school district in the US to do this.”\n‘It’s a paradigm shift’\nThe German historian Arno Peters published his projection in 1974. It matches work by a Scottish 19th-century mapmaker, James Gall, and is also known as the Gall-Peters projection. It is an “equal-area” map, distorting the shape of countries as a two-dimensional visualization of a three-dimensional globe but accurately scaling surface areas.\nThe result goes a long way to rewriting the historical and sociopolitical message of the Mercator map, which exaggerates the size of imperialist powers.\n“This is the start of a three-year effort to decolonize the curriculum in our public schools,” said Colin Rose, assistant superintendent of opportunity and achievement gaps for Boston public schools.\nThe district has 125 schools and 57,000 students, 86% of whom are non-white, with the largest groups being Latino and black. After changing the maps, Rose said, educators plan to look at other subjects and shift away from presenting white history as the dominant perspective.\nTo begin with, the Peters maps are being introduced to one grade level in elementary school, one in middle school and one in high school. They will then be phased into all grades. Mercator projection maps will not be removed but all new maps purchased will be the Peters projection, Rose said. The decision, he said, was made internally and not put to public consultation.\nThe respective merits of the Mercator and the Peters maps have long been debated. A spirited discussion about their implications even featured on an episode of the West Wing, in which characters argued for the Peters map to be used in US public schools and told the administration the Mercator projection had “fostered European imperialist attitudes for centuries”, creating an “ethical bias” for “western civilization” against the developing world.\nThe West Wing puts Gall-Peters on the map.\n“Maybe we can be an example for other school districts,” said Rose. “It’s a paradigm shift. It’s important that students trust the material they are given in school but also question it.\n“The Mercator projection is a symbolic representation that put Europe at the center of the world. And when you continue to show images of the places where people’s heritage is rooted that is not accurate, that has an effect on students.”\nCurriculum chiefs consulted map experts at the Boston public library and were directed to ODT, a company in Amherst, Massachusetts, that is the exclusive North American publisher of Peters projection maps.\nODT founder Bob Abramms said: “The Peters projection has created a lot of controversy over the years because it distorts shapes, but it’s enormously visually important in terms of the scale and position of the terrain on the Earth, showing correct size and proportion of the continents.”\nJane Elliott is an Iowa-based lecturer in race relations who became famous for a landmark antiracism exercise, immediately after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968, which involved instructing white schoolchildren to discriminate against one another based on eye color. On Saturday, she said she was delighted to hear of Boston’s move.\n“The Mercator projection showed the spread and power of Christianity and is standard,” she said. “But it is not the real world at all. What the Boston public schools are doing is extremely important and should be adopted across the whole of the US and beyond.”\nElliott, who is still teaching at 83, said she was booked to give lectures in Michigan, Iowa, Missouri and Texas this week, and would be hailing Boston’s move.\n“This is going to change how kids see the world much for the better,” she said.\nThis article was amended on 23 March 2017 to correct an error referring to the position of the equator on the Mercator projection, and to clarify a point about the common use of such maps.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about Boston public schools switching to the Peters projection map as an alternative to the Mercator projection.

The court also said it would take up and decide the Alabama dispute on the merits, with arguments expected in the fall and a decision due by June 2023.\nThe state legislature previously approved the map delineating the borders of Alabama's seven U.S. House of Representatives districts.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nA panel of three federal judges on Jan. 24 ruled that the map unlawfully deprived Black voters of an additional House district in which they could be a majority or close to it, likely violating the Voting Rights Act, a landmark 1965 federal law that prohibited racial discrimination in voting.\nDemocrats control the House by a slim margin, making every seat vital in the Republican attempt to win back a majority.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe Alabama dispute reflects an ongoing issue of contention between Democrats and Republicans in a broader fight over voting rights. Democrats have accused Republicans in various states of exploiting their majorities in state legislatures to craft electoral maps that diminish the clout of Black and other racial minority voters while maximizing the power of White voters.\nAlabama's legislature adopted the latest map of the state's seven House districts last November. Several lawsuits were filed challenging the map, including by a group of Black voters and another group of voters who sued alongside the Alabama NAACP civil rights group.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n'JUDICIAL TINKERING'\nIn a written opinion, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower court blocked Alabama's map too close to the 2022 election, contravening Supreme Court precedent.\n\"Late judicial tinkering with election laws can lead to disruption and to unanticipated and unfair consequences for candidates, political parties and voters, among others,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\nLiberal Justice Elena Kagan called the decision \"badly wrong\" and, referring to the Voting Rights Act, said the high court's action \"forces Black Alabamians to suffer what under that law is clear vote dilution.\" Her dissent was joined by fellow liberal Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\"Alabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians' voting rights just because the court's order came down in the first month of an election year,\" Kagan added.\nIn his dissent, Roberts wrote that the lower court \"properly applied existing law in an extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction.\"\nThe action in the case reflects an increasingly assertive Supreme Court since the 2020 addition of former President Donald Trump's third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, gave it a 6-3 conservative majority.

{"num":12,"Time":"Tue 8 Aug 2017 08.00 CEST","Title":"Rise of the racist robots – how AI is learning all our worst impulses","Content":"I\nn May last year, a stunning report claimed that a computer program used by a US court for risk assessment was biased against black prisoners. The program, Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (Compas), was much more prone to mistakenly label black defendants as likely to reoffend – wrongly flagging them at almost twice the rate as white people (45% to 24%), according to the investigative journalism organisation ProPublica.\nCompas and programs similar to it were in use in hundreds of courts across the US, potentially informing the decisions of judges and other officials. The message seemed clear: the US justice system, reviled for its racial bias, had turned to technology for help, only to find that the algorithms had a racial bias too.\nHow could this have happened? The private company that supplies the software, Northpointe, disputed the conclusions of the report, but declined to reveal the inner workings of the program, which it considers commercially sensitive. The accusation gave frightening substance to a worry that has been brewing among activists and computer scientists for years and which the tech giants Google and Microsoft have recently taken steps to investigate: that as our computational tools have become more advanced, they have become more opaque. The data they rely on – arrest records, postcodes, social affiliations, income – can reflect, and further ingrain, human prejudice.\nThe promise of machine learning and other programs that work with big data (often under the umbrella term “artificial intelligence” or AI) was that the more information we feed these sophisticated computer algorithms, the better they perform. Last year, according to global management consultant McKinsey, tech companies spent somewhere between $20bn and $30bn on AI, mostly in research and development. Investors are making a big bet that AI will sift through the vast amounts of information produced by our society and find patterns that will help us be more efficient, wealthier and happier.\nIt has led to a decade-long AI arms race in which the UK government is offering six-figure salaries to computer scientists. They hope to use machine learning to, among other things, help unemployed people find jobs, predict the performance of pension funds and sort through revenue and customs casework. It has become a kind of received wisdom that these programs will touch every aspect of our lives. (“It’s impossible to know how widely adopted AI is now, but I do know we can’t go back,” one computer scientist says.)\nIt’s impossible to know how widely adopted AI is now, but I do know we can’t go back\nBut, while some of the most prominent voices in the industry are concerned with the far-off future apocalyptic potential of AI, there is less attention paid to the more immediate problem of how we prevent these programs from amplifying the inequalities of our past and affecting the most vulnerable members of our society. When the data we feed the machines reflects the history of our own unequal society, we are, in effect, asking the program to learn our own biases.\n“If you’re not careful, you risk automating the exact same biases these programs are supposed to eliminate,” says Kristian Lum, the lead statistician at the San Francisco-based, non-profit Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG). Last year, Lum and a co-author showed that PredPol, a program for police departments that predicts hotspots where future crime might occur, could potentially get stuck in a feedback loop of over-policing majority black and brown neighbourhoods. The program was “learning” from previous crime reports. For Samuel Sinyangwe, a justice activist and policy researcher, this kind of approach is “especially nefarious” because police can say: “We’re not being biased, we’re just doing what the math tells us.” And the public perception might be that the algorithms are impartial.\nWe have already seen glimpses of what might be on the horizon. Programs developed by companies at the forefront of AI research have resulted in a string of errors that look uncannily like the darker biases of humanity: a Google image recognition program labelled the faces of several black people as gorillas; a LinkedIn advertising program showed a preference for male names in searches, and a Microsoft chatbot called Tay spent a day learning from Twitter and began spouting antisemitic messages.\nThese small-scale incidents were all quickly fixed by the companies involved and have generally been written off as “gaffes”. But the Compas revelation and Lum’s study hint at a much bigger problem, demonstrating how programs could replicate the sort of large-scale systemic biases that people have spent decades campaigning to educate or legislate away.\nComputers don’t become biased on their own. They need to learn that from us. For years, the vanguard of computer science has been working on machine learning, often having programs learn in a similar way to humans – observing the world (or at least the world we show them) and identifying patterns. In 2012, Google researchers fed their computer “brain” millions of images from YouTube videos to see what it could recognise. It responded with blurry black-and-white outlines of human and cat faces. The program was never given a definition of a human face or a cat; it had observed and “learned” two of our favourite subjects.\nTay, Microsoft’s artificial intelligence chatbot. Photograph: Microsoft\nThis sort of approach has allowed computers to perform tasks – such as language translation, recognising faces or recommending films in your Netflix queue – that just a decade ago would have been considered too complex to automate. But as the algorithms learn and adapt from their original coding, they become more opaque and less predictable. It can soon become difficult to understand exactly how the complex interaction of algorithms generated a problematic result. And, even if we could, private companies are disinclined to reveal the commercially sensitive inner workings of their algorithms (as was the case with Northpointe).\nLess difficult is predicting where problems can arise. Take Google’s face recognition program: cats are uncontroversial, but what if it was to learn what British and American people think a CEO looks like? The results would likely resemble the near-identical portraits of older white men that line any bank or corporate lobby. And the program wouldn’t be inaccurate: only 7% of FTSE CEOs are women. Even fewer, just 3%, have a BME background. When computers learn from us, they can learn our less appealing attributes.\nJoanna Bryson, a researcher at the University of Bath, studied a program designed to “learn” relationships between words. It trained on millions of pages of text from the internet and began clustering female names and pronouns with jobs such as “receptionist” and “nurse”. Bryson says she was astonished by how closely the results mirrored the real-world gender breakdown of those jobs in US government data, a nearly 90% correlation.\n“People expected AI to be unbiased; that’s just wrong. If the underlying data reflects stereotypes, or if you train AI from human culture, you will find these things,” Bryson says.\nPeople expected AI to be unbiased; that’s just wrong\nSo who stands to lose out the most? Cathy O’Neil, the author of the book Weapons of Math Destruction about the dangerous consequences of outsourcing decisions to computers, says it’s generally the most vulnerable in society who are exposed to evaluation by automated systems. A rich person is unlikely to have their job application screened by a computer, or their loan request evaluated by anyone other than a bank executive. In the justice system, the thousands of defendants with no money for a lawyer or other counsel would be the most likely candidates for automated evaluation.\nIn London, Hackney council has recently been working with a private company to apply AI to data, including government health and debt records, to help predict which families have children at risk of ending up in statutory care. Other councils have reportedly looked into similar programs.\nIn her 2016 paper, HRDAG’s Kristian Lum demonstrated who would be affected if a program designed to increase the efficiency of policing was let loose on biased data. Lum and her co-author took PredPol – the program that suggests the likely location of future crimes based on recent crime and arrest statistics – and fed it historical drug-crime data from the city of Oakland’s police department. PredPol showed a daily map of likely “crime hotspots” that police could deploy to, based on information about where police had previously made arrests. The program was suggesting majority black neighbourhoods at about twice the rate of white ones, despite the fact that when the statisticians modelled the city’s likely overall drug use, based on national statistics, it was much more evenly distributed.\nAs if that wasn’t bad enough, the researchers also simulated what would happen if police had acted directly on PredPol’s hotspots every day and increased their arrests accordingly: the program entered a feedback loop, predicting more and more crime in the neighbourhoods that police visited most. That caused still more police to be sent in. It was a virtual mirror of the real-world criticisms of initiatives such as New York City’s controversial “stop-and-frisk” policy. By over-targeting residents with a particular characteristic, police arrested them at an inflated rate, which then justified further policing.\nPredPol’s co-developer, Prof Jeff Brantingham, acknowledged the concerns when asked by the Washington Post. He claimed that – to combat bias – drug arrests and other offences that rely on the discretion of officers were not used with the software because they are often more heavily enforced in poor and minority communities.\nAnd while most of us don’t understand the complex code within programs such as PredPol, Hamid Khan, an organiser with Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, a community group addressing police surveillance in Los Angeles, says that people do recognise predictive policing as “another top-down approach where policing remains the same: pathologising whole communities”.\nThere is a saying in computer science, something close to an informal law: garbage in, garbage out. It means that programs are not magic. If you give them flawed information, they won’t fix the flaws, they just process the information. Khan has his own truism: “It’s racism in, racism out.”\nIt’s unclear how existing laws to protect against discrimination and to regulate algorithmic decision-making apply in this new landscape. Often the technology moves faster than governments can address its effects. In 2016, the Cornell University professor and former Microsoft researcher Solon Barocas claimed that current laws “largely fail to address discrimination” when it comes to big data and machine learning. Barocas says that many traditional players in civil rights, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), are taking the issue on in areas such as housing or hiring practices. Sinyangwe recently worked with the ACLU to try to pass city-level policies requiring police to disclose any technology they adopt, including AI.\nSamuel Sinyangwe … working to force authorities to disclose when they use technology. Photograph: Samuel Sinyangwe\nBut the process is complicated by the fact that public institutions adopt technology sold by private companies, whose inner workings may not be transparent. “We don’t want to deputise these companies to regulate themselves,” says Barocas.\nIn the UK, there are some existing protections. Government services and companies must disclose if a decision has been entirely outsourced to a computer, and, if so, that decision can be challenged. But Sandra Wachter, a law scholar at the Alan Turing Institute at Oxford University, says that the existing laws don’t map perfectly to the way technology has advanced. There are a variety of loopholes that could allow the undisclosed use of algorithms. She has called for a “right to explanation”, which would require a full disclosure as well as a higher degree of transparency for any use of these programs.\nThe scientific literature on the topic now reflects a debate on the nature of “fairness” itself, and researchers are working on everything from ways to strip “unfair” classifiers from decades of historical data, to modifying algorithms to skirt round any groups protected by existing anti-discrimination laws. One researcher at the Turing Institute told me the problem was so difficult because “changing the variables can introduce new bias, and sometimes we’re not even sure how bias affects the data, or even where it is”.\nThe institute has developed a program that tests a series of counterfactual propositions to track what affects algorithmic decisions: would the result be the same if the person was white, or older, or lived elsewhere? But there are some who consider it an impossible task to integrate the various definitions of fairness adopted by society and computer scientists, and still retain a functional program.\n“In many ways, we’re seeing a response to the naive optimism of the earlier days,” Barocas says. “Just two or three years ago you had articles credulously claiming: ‘Isn’t this great? These things are going to eliminate bias from hiring decisions and everything else.’”\nMeanwhile, computer scientists face an unfamiliar challenge: their work necessarily looks to the future, but in embracing machines that learn, they find themselves tied to our age-old problems of the past.\nFollow the Guardian’s Inequality Project on Twitter here, or email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses the issue of bias in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms.

It also runs a shelter in Reynosa with the church group Kaleo International.\n“There are about 4,000 Black asylum seekers waiting in Reynosa and at least another 1,000 Haitians in Matamoros.

But with the app unable to map the features of many darker-skinned asylum seekers, they cannot upload their photos in order to receive an asylum appointment with the US immigration authorities, Pinheiro said.\n“The Haitians at the workshop were getting error after error message on the app,” she said.\nRangel-Samponaro noted that others are being blocked, too. “We’ve also seen it affect Venezuelans who are darker-skinned,” she said.\nRacial bias in face recognition technology has long been a problem. Increasingly used by law enforcement and government agencies to fill databases with biometric information including fingerprints and iris scans, a 2020 report by Harvard University called it the “least accurate” identifier, especially among darker-skinned women with whom the error rate is higher than 30%.\nEmmanuella Camille, a staff attorney with the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a non-profit that aids Haitian and African asylum seekers, said the CBP One app has helped “lighter-skin toned people from other nations” obtain their asylum appointments “but not Haitians” and other Black applicants.\nBesides the face recognition technology not registering them, there are other barriers, too. Many asylum seekers have outdated cellphones – if they have cellphones at all – that don’t support the CBP One app and often have limited or no access to the internet.\nAll three of the non-profits told the Guardian they have been in daily contact with US CBP about issues with the app. Last week, CBP introduced a Haitian Creole version of the app, Camille said.

Roberts was joined by fellow conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the court's three liberals, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nWith Thursday's ruling, the Supreme Court elected not to further roll back protections contained in the Voting Rights Act as it had done in two major rulings in the past decade. The decision centered upon Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, a provision aimed at countering measures that result in racial bias in voting even absent racist intent.\n\"We find Alabama's new approach to (Section 2) compelling neither in theory nor in practice,\" Roberts wrote. \"We accordingly decline to recast our (Section 2) case law as Alabama requests.\"\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nAt issue was the map approved in 2021 by the Republican-controlled state legislature setting the boundaries of Alabama's seven U.S. House of Representatives districts. The map featured one majority-Black district, with six majority-white districts, even though Black people comprised 27% of Alabama's population.\nThe ruling on Thursday affirmed the lower court's order that Alabama configure a second House district where Black voters could hold a \"a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.\" That marked a shift from an emergency 5-4 ruling the court issued last year that let Alabama use the disputed map for the 2022 U.S. congressional elections in which Republicans seized control of the House from Democrats.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe new congressional map, expected to be in place for the 2024 elections, could boost Democratic efforts to regain a majority in the House, which Republicans now control by a narrow 222-212 margin.\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland hailed the ruling, saying it \"rejects efforts to further erode fundamental voting rights protections, and preserves the principle that in the United States, all eligible voters must be able to exercise their constitutional right to vote free from discrimination based on their race.\"\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe Voting Rights Act was passed at a time when Southern states including Alabama enforced policies blocking Black people from casting ballots.

REUTERS\/Michael A. McCoy\/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\nConservative states and groups had previously succeeded in prodding the Supreme Court to limit the Voting Rights Act's scope. Its 2013 ruling in another Alabama case struck down a key part that determined which states with histories of racial discrimination needed federal approval to change voting laws. In a 2021 ruling endorsing Republican-backed Arizona voting restrictions, the justices made it harder to prove violations under Section 2.\n'TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE'\nBlack voters and advocacy groups who sued Alabama argued that the state's map reduced the influence of Black voters by concentrating their voting power in one district while distributing the rest of the Black population in other districts at levels too small to form a majority. A three-judge federal court panel last year sided with the challengers.\nAbha Khanna, who argued the case on behalf of one set of challengers, said, \"Thankfully, the court today identified Alabama's redistricting scheme as a textbook violation of the landmark civil rights law,\" Khanna said.\nThe Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority and, based on the questioning during oral arguments in the case in October, had appeared to lean toward favoring Alabama.\nUCLA School of Law election law expert Rick Hasen said that \"to have Roberts and Kavanaugh join the liberals in upholding the Voting Rights Act is a big surprise, and a good result for minority voters.\"\nConservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote separate dissenting opinions. Thomas wrote that the question before the court was whether Section 2 required Alabama \"to intentionally redraw its longstanding congressional districts so that black voters can control a number of seats roughly proportional to the black share of the state's population.\"\nThomas wrote, \"Section 2 demands no such thing, and, if it did, the Constitution would not permit it.\"\nAlabama officials argued that drawing a second district to give Black voters a better chance at electing their preferred candidate would itself be racially discriminatory by favoring them at the expense of other voters. If the Voting Rights Act required the state to consider race in such a manner, according to Alabama, the statute would violate the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law.\nElectoral districts are redrawn each decade to reflect population changes as measured by a national census, last taken in 2020. In most states, such redistricting is done by the party in power, which can lead to map manipulation for partisan gain.\nReporting by John Kruzel in Washington; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAcquire Licensing Rights\n, opens new tab","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of electoral map bias.

{"num":18,"Time":null,"Title":"The human genome needs updating. But how do we make it fair?","Content":"I\nn June 2000, Bill Clinton, the then US president, stood smilingly next to the leaders of the Human Genome Project. “In genetic terms, all human beings, regardless of race, are more than 99.9% the same,” he declared. That was the message when the first draft of the human genome sequence was revealed at the White House.\nThe single string of As, Ts, Cs and Gs eventually became the first human reference genome. Since its publication in 2003, the reference has revolutionised genome sequencing and helped scientists find thousands of disease-causing mutations. Yet at its core is a somewhat ironic problem: the code meant to represent the human species is mostly based on just one man from Buffalo, New York.\nThough humans are very similar, “One person is not representative of the world,” says Pui-Yan Kwok, a specialist in genome analysis based at University of California, San Francisco and Academia Sinica in Taiwan. As a result, most genome sequencing is fundamentally biased.\nThis bias limits the kind of genetic variation that can be detected, leaving some patients without diagnoses and potentially without proper treatment. What is more, people who share less ancestry with the man from Buffalo will probably benefit less from the incoming era of precision medicine, which promises to tailor healthcare to individuals.\nTo combat this, researchers have started to assemble reference genomes for specific countries, including South Korea, Japan, Sweden, Denmark and the United Arab Emirates. They hope this will serve their populations better, but critics worry it could turn migrants into second-class citizens in their healthcare systems. Now, a huge new project is offering a different solution with the aim to represent global diversity: a human pangenome.\nP\nrecision medicine, also known as personalised medicine, has been a buzzword within the medical community for years and it undeniably sounds good. “Getting the right medicine to the right patient at the right time is the tagline,” says Neil Hanchard, a physician scientist at the US National Human Genome Research Institute.\nBut standard genome sequencing misses a lot of variation that could be connected to disease. In most cases, it works by chopping DNA into small bits known as “short reads”, before sequencing them and organising them into a genome using the reference as a guide.\nSingle nucleotide variants (SNVs) – a change from a C to a T in the code of a gene, say – are mostly easy to spot this way, but larger chunks of variation known as structural variants (SVs) are trickier. New sections, sometimes hundreds or thousands of base pairs long, can go undetected, as can sections that are missing, reversed or moved somewhere else. In those cases, short reads cannot easily be mapped to the reference and “a whole bunch”, says Kwok, are thrown away.\nFormer US president Bill Clinton hosts the launch of the Human Genome project in June 2000. Photograph: Stephen Jaffe\/AFP\/Getty Images\nThis means that standard genome sequencing is biased towards the SVs already in the reference. If your SVs differ, you end up with a sequence that does not fully capture your personal variation. As it is these small differences between people that we hope will tell us, for example, why one person might respond well to a medicine but another person will not, that is bad news.\nKwok’s work hints at the amount of SVs going undetected. In 2019, his team analysed samples from 154 people around the world and found 60m base pairs-worth of SV genome content missing from the reference, with much more still out there. A follow-up of 338 people that looked only for extra inserted DNA found nearly 130,000 new sequences.\nBut SVs also appear to show different frequency patterns in different populations. By extension, says Kwok, if a person “is from a population quite different from the person from which the genome reference is derived, there will be more misalignment” when their short reads are mapped to the reference. Consequently, he says: “We may miss risk variants in those regions not represented in the reference.”\nThis lack of representation is a general problem in genomics. Even the more studied SNVs show large data gaps. Recently, for example, Hanchard and his colleagues sampled 426 individuals from 50 ethnolinguistic groups across Africa and found more than 3m new SNVs, mostly from populations that had never been sampled before. “We haven’t even touched [SVs],” says Hanchard, “but our preliminary data suggests it’s going to be more of the same.”\nSuch data disparities directly affect medical outcomes. For example, if a person with a rare variant has a rare disease, there is a good chance the variant is responsible. But often we do not know whether variants are genuinely rare, or just common in understudied populations. In those cases, doctors cannot give a diagnosis. “For persons with non-European ancestry, that occurs a lot more,” says Hanchard.\nAs we move into an era of precision medicine, that will only become more important. Kári Stefánsson, whose Reykjavik-based biotechnology company DeCode Genetics specialises in connecting the dots between genetic variants and disease, says that what keeps him up at night is that our understanding of diversity within populations of European descent is now so good that we can start to use it for precision medicine. But for other populations, “We do not have the same kind of data,” he says. “[This] is going to increase healthcare disparities above and beyond what they are today.”\nW\nhile there are no genetic underpinnings that meaningfully group people into different races, some believe it makes sense to create references to capture the variation within specific populations, such as ethnic groups and nation states. One country that now has its own reference is Denmark.\n“What we see is that there’s a lot of variation that [has only been detected in] the Danish population,” says computational biologist Simon Rasmussen of Copenhagen University, who led the work. That is a strong argument for a local reference, and the appeal is obvious: a reference based on Danes is uniquely positioned to supercharge the Danish healthcare system.\nFraming genomes in terms of nationality does inevitably lead to exclusion\nJenny Reardon, sociologist\nBut some criticise national genomes for focusing too much on differences between populations, rather than individuals. Medical anthropologist Emma Kowal of Deakin University in Victoria, Australia, worries that national genomes might “keep the idea of race alive”. And framing genomes in terms of nationality does inevitably lead to exclusion, says Jenny Reardon, a sociologist of the life sciences based at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “We are deciding, in effect, who is Danish and who is not.”\nRasmussen admits the reference would be less useful for the 15% of the Danish population who are migrants or their descendants. Samples from people with mixed ancestry were even removed during the selection for the reference. But because of consent problems the reference never made it to the clinic, so Rasmussen and his team want to create another. For that, he says: “We want to take a different [selection] approach.” Exactly how is yet to be determined.\nThere is an alternative to the national genomes, though. Instead of zooming in on different populations, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium wants to zoom out; overlaying many genomes to create a reference that has variation built into it – a pangenome. The consortium recently published the first draft of such a reference in a preprint.\nState-of-the-art gene-sequencing machines offer the possibility of medicine tailored to each patient. Photograph: Carolyn Fong\/Carolyn Fong\/NYT\/ eyevine\nMade up of 47 exquisitely detailed genomes, the draft represents the first chunk of the 350 genomes it is planning to sequence to include the most common variation across the world. “This is not a standard that has ever been performed before,” says Karen Miga of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who is part of the consortium.\nBut the project is not just about sequencing more diverse data. “We need to come up with a better data structure to encode that information,” says Miga’s colleague Ting Wang of Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri.\nThat data structure is called a genome graph. In contrast to the current reference, which is just a long string of letters, the genome graph shows variation between genomes as detours on an otherwise shared path. That will enable researchers and doctors to map short reads to the version of the path that best fits their sample.\nThe natural question is: how does one choose who gets to represent the world? The first genomes qualified because of their high technical quality, but the consortium will need to choose new samples in future. Since Africa is the cradle of humanity, Miga says: “The vast majority of the genomes that we are including are of African ancestry.”\nFrom Reardon’s perspective, however, 350 people might do a better job of representing the world than one person, but “[the consortium] have made some choices about groups,” she says. “Who did they sample? Who did they not sample?” As long as the reference contains only a subset, arguably someone will not make the cut.\nMiga does not deny that. “[We are] really trying to capture common variation at a global level, so things you would see quite frequently,” she says. Documenting common variation in this case leaves out uncommon variation. “If you’re looking for something extremely rare,” she says, “that is not our charge at the moment.”\nI\nn an ideal world, individuals would have their genomes sequenced without the use of a reference. This has long been held up as the ultimate, problem-free solution, but hardly anyone believes that is on the cards. “It’s not a trivial undertaking and I don’t see it being non-trivial in 10 years’ time,” says Hanchard.\nAnd rather than using a broad, global pangenome, countries might be swayed by a reference more tuned to their population, as well as maintained and controlled by themselves. “We don’t really expect anyone other than the Danes to make a Danish reference genome,” says Rasmussen, who hopes the next iteration will be run by Denmark’s state-controlled National Genome Centre, potentially as part of the EU’s Genome of Europe project.\nHanchard also sees the benefit of local or regional references. “[The pangenome] is not going to have all the variation represented,” he says. He is part of the H3Africa consortium, which aims to bring the benefits of genomics to Africa and is considering an Africa-specific genome graph. At the same time, he expects all these references will probably eventually coalesce.\nWhen asked about his hopes for the future of genomics, he speaks of knowing and understanding the variation as it relates to himself, or anyone else with Jamaican ancestry. “I would love to get to a point where everyone feels represented and that this is for them, as much as it is for any particular group,” he says. “We are from one humanity, that’s the important part.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses the issue of bias in genomic reference data, which is relevant to the concept of digital map bias in the field of genomics.

A buyer may use it to learn what traffic around a property is like throughout the week, for example.\nDe Taeye said Tele Atlas already offered services to governments, utility companies, planners and fleet managers and would expand those.\nTele Atlas was forced to cut its 2008 forecasts after a weak first quarter, but De Taeye described this as a “hiccup”.\n“Don’t derive from that that there will be a trend change,” he said, adding the market for car navigation devices still appeared far away from saturation.\n“There is no data point whatsoever that would indicate that we’re even close to saturation,” he said.

You do not want to type seven letters into Google. That’s all I did. I typed: “a-r-e”. And then “j-e-w-s”. Since 2008, Google has attempted to predict what question you might be asking and offers you a choice. And this is what it did. It offered me a choice of potential questions it thought I might want to ask: “are jews a race?”, “are jews white?”, “are jews christians?”, and finally, “are jews evil?”\nAre Jews evil? It’s not a question I’ve ever thought of asking. I hadn’t gone looking for it. But there it was. I press enter. A page of results appears. This was Google’s question. And this was Google’s answer: Jews are evil. Because there, on my screen, was the proof: an entire page of results, nine out of 10 of which “confirm” this. The top result, from a site called Listovative, has the headline: “Top 10 Major Reasons Why People Hate Jews.” I click on it: “Jews today have taken over marketing, militia, medicinal, technological, media, industrial, cinema challenges etc and continue to face the worlds [sic] envy through unexplained success stories given their inglorious past and vermin like repression all over Europe.”\nGoogle is search. It’s the verb, to Google. It’s what we all do, all the time, whenever we want to know anything. We Google it. The site handles at least 63,000 searches a second, 5.5bn a day. Its mission as a company, the one-line overview that has informed the company since its foundation and is still the banner headline on its corporate website today, is to “organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”. It strives to give you the best, most relevant results. And in this instance the third-best, most relevant result to the search query “are Jews… ” is a link to an article from stormfront.org, a neo-Nazi website. The fifth is a YouTube video: “Why the Jews are Evil. Why we are against them.”\nThe sixth is from Yahoo Answers: “Why are Jews so evil?” The seventh result is: “Jews are demonic souls from a different world.” And the 10th is from jesus-is-saviour.com: “Judaism is Satanic!”\nThere’s one result in the 10 that offers a different point of view. It’s a link to a rather dense, scholarly book review from thetabletmag.com, a Jewish magazine, with the unfortunately misleading headline: “Why Literally Everybody In the World Hates Jews.”\nI feel like I’ve fallen down a wormhole, entered some parallel universe where black is white, and good is bad. Though later, I think that perhaps what I’ve actually done is scraped the topsoil off the surface of 2016 and found one of the underground springs that has been quietly nurturing it. It’s been there all the time, of course. Just a few keystrokes away… on our laptops, our tablets, our phones. This isn’t a secret Nazi cell lurking in the shadows. It’s hiding in plain sight.\nAre women… Google’s search results.\nStories about fake news on Facebook have dominated certain sections of the press for weeks following the American presidential election, but arguably this is even more powerful, more insidious. Frank Pasquale, professor of law at the University of Maryland, and one of the leading academic figures calling for tech companies to be more open and transparent, calls the results “very profound, very troubling”.\nHe came across a similar instance in 2006 when, “If you typed ‘Jew’ in Google, the first result was jewwatch.org. It was ‘look out for these awful Jews who are ruining your life’. And the Anti-Defamation League went after them and so they put an asterisk next to it which said: ‘These search results may be disturbing but this is an automated process.’ But what you’re showing – and I’m very glad you are documenting it and screenshotting it – is that despite the fact they have vastly researched this problem, it has gotten vastly worse.”\nAnd ordering of search results does influence people, says Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College, London, who has written at length on the impact of the big tech companies on our civic and political spheres. “There’s large-scale, statistically significant research into the impact of search results on political views. And the way in which you see the results and the types of results you see on the page necessarily has an impact on your perspective.” Fake news, he says, has simply “revealed a much bigger problem. These companies are so powerful and so committed to disruption. They thought they were disrupting politics but in a positive way. They hadn’t thought about the downsides. These tools offer remarkable empowerment, but there’s a dark side to it. It enables people to do very cynical, damaging things.”\nGoogle is knowledge. It’s where you go to find things out. And evil Jews are just the start of it. There are also evil women. I didn’t go looking for them either. This is what I type: “a-r-e w-o-m-e-n”. And Google offers me just two choices, the first of which is: “Are women evil?” I press return. Yes, they are. Every one of the 10 results “confirms” that they are, including the top one, from a site called sheddingoftheego.com, which is boxed out and highlighted: “Every woman has some degree of prostitute in her. Every woman has a little evil in her… Women don’t love men, they love what they can do for them. It is within reason to say women feel attraction but they cannot love men.”\nNext I type: “a-r-e m-u-s-l-i-m-s”. And Google suggests I should ask: “Are Muslims bad?” And here’s what I find out: yes, they are. That’s what the top result says and six of the others. Without typing anything else, simply putting the cursor in the search box, Google offers me two new searches and I go for the first, “Islam is bad for society”. In the next list of suggestions, I’m offered: “Islam must be destroyed.”\nThis is the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate\nDanny Sullivan\nJews are evil. Muslims need to be eradicated. And Hitler? Do you want to know about Hitler? Let’s Google it. “Was Hitler bad?” I type. And here’s Google’s top result: “10 Reasons Why Hitler Was One Of The Good Guys” I click on the link: “He never wanted to kill any Jews”; “he cared about conditions for Jews in the work camps”; “he implemented social and cultural reform.” Eight out of the other 10 search results agree: Hitler really wasn’t that bad.\nA few days later, I talk to Danny Sullivan, the founding editor of SearchEngineLand.com. He’s been recommended to me by several academics as one of the most knowledgeable experts on search. Am I just being naive, I ask him? Should I have known this was out there? “No, you’re not being naive,” he says. “This is awful. It’s horrible. It’s the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate. Google is doing a horrible, horrible job of delivering answers here. It can and should do better.”\nHe’s surprised too. “I thought they stopped offering autocomplete suggestions for religions in 2011.” And then he types “are women” into his own computer. “Good lord! That answer at the top. It’s a featured result. It’s called a “direct answer”. This is supposed to be indisputable. It’s Google’s highest endorsement.” That every women has some degree of prostitute in her? “Yes. This is Google’s algorithm going terribly wrong.”\nI contacted Google about its seemingly malfunctioning autocomplete suggestions and received the following response: “Our search results are a reflection of the content across the web. This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs – as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.”\nGoogle isn’t just a search engine, of course. Search was the foundation of the company but that was just the beginning. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, now has the greatest concentration of artificial intelligence experts in the world. It is expanding into healthcare, transportation, energy. It’s able to attract the world’s top computer scientists, physicists and engineers. It’s bought hundreds of start-ups, including Calico, whose stated mission is to “cure death” and DeepMind, which aims to “solve intelligence”.\nGoogle co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2002. Photograph: Michael Grecco\/Getty Images\nAnd 20 years ago it didn’t even exist. When Tony Blair became prime minister, it wasn’t possible to Google him: the search engine had yet to be invented. The company was only founded in 1998 and Facebook didn’t appear until 2004. Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are still only 43. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is 32. Everything they’ve done, the world they’ve remade, has been done in the blink of an eye.\nBut it seems the implications about the power and reach of these companies is only now seeping into the public consciousness. I ask Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights project at the New America Foundation, whether it was the recent furore over fake news that woke people up to the danger of ceding our rights as citizens to corporations. “It’s kind of weird right now,” she says, “because people are finally saying, ‘Gee, Facebook and Google really have a lot of power’ like it’s this big revelation. And it’s like, ‘D’oh.’”\nMacKinnon has a particular expertise in how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and bend it to their purposes. “China and Russia are a cautionary tale for us. I think what happens is that it goes back and forth. So during the Arab spring, it seemed like the good guys were further ahead. And now it seems like the bad guys are. Pro-democracy activists are using the internet more than ever but at the same time, the adversary has gotten so much more skilled.”\nLast week Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of communications at Elon University in North Carolina, published the first detailed research on how rightwing websites had spread their message. “I took a list of these fake news sites that was circulating, I had an initial list of 306 of them and I used a tool – like the one Google uses – to scrape them for links and then I mapped them. So I looked at where the links went – into YouTube and Facebook, and between each other, millions of them… and I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing.\n“They have created a web that is bleeding through on to our web. This isn’t a conspiracy. There isn’t one person who’s created this. It’s a vast system of hundreds of different sites that are using all the same tricks that all websites use. They’re sending out thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system.”\nHe found 23,000 pages and 1.3m hyperlinks. “And Facebook is just the amplification device. When you look at it in 3D, it actually looks like a virus. And Facebook was just one of the hosts for the virus that helps it spread faster. You can see the New York Times in there and the Washington Post and then you can see how there’s a vast, vast network surrounding them. The best way of describing it is as an ecosystem. This really goes way beyond individual sites or individual stories. What this map shows is the distribution network and you can see that it’s surrounding and actually choking the mainstream news ecosystem.”\nLike a cancer? “Like an organism that is growing and getting stronger all the time.”\nCharlie Beckett, a professor in the school of media and communications at LSE, tells me: “We’ve been arguing for some time now that plurality of news media is good. Diversity is good. Critiquing the mainstream media is good. But now… it’s gone wildly out of control. What Jonathan Albright’s research has shown is that this isn’t a byproduct of the internet. And it’s not even being done for commercial reasons. It’s motivated by ideology, by people who are quite deliberately trying to destabilise the internet.”\nA spatial map of the rightwing fake news ecosystem. Jonathan Albright, assistant professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, “scraped” 300 fake news sites (the dark shapes on this map) to reveal the 1.3m hyperlinks that connect them together and link them into the mainstream news ecosystem. Here, Albright shows it is a “vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system”. Photograph: Jonathan Albright\nAlbright’s map also provides a clue to understanding the Google search results I found. What these rightwing news sites have done, he explains, is what most commercial websites try to do. They try to find the tricks that will move them up Google’s PageRank system. They try and “game” the algorithm. And what his map shows is how well they’re doing that.\nThat’s what my searches are showing too. That the right has colonised the digital space around these subjects – Muslims, women, Jews, the Holocaust, black people – far more effectively than the liberal left.\n“It’s an information war,” says Albright. “That’s what I keep coming back to.”\nBut it’s where it goes from here that’s truly frightening. I ask him how it can be stopped. “I don’t know. I’m not sure it can be. It’s a network. It’s far more powerful than any one actor.”\nSo, it’s almost got a life of its own? “Yes, and it’s learning. Every day, it’s getting stronger.”\nThe more people who search for information about Jews, the more people will see links to hate sites, and the more they click on those links (very few people click on to the second page of results) the more traffic the sites will get, the more links they will accrue and the more authoritative they will appear. This is an entirely circular knowledge economy that has only one outcome: an amplification of the message. Jews are evil. Women are evil. Islam must be destroyed. Hitler was one of the good guys.\nFake news and a 400-year-old problem: we need to resolve the ‘post-truth’ crisis\nRead more\nAnd the constellation of websites that Albright found – a sort of shadow internet – has another function. More than just spreading rightwing ideology, they are being used to track and monitor and influence anyone who comes across their content. “I scraped the trackers on these sites and I was absolutely dumbfounded. Every time someone likes one of these posts on Facebook or visits one of these websites, the scripts are then following you around the web. And this enables data-mining and influencing companies like Cambridge Analytica to precisely target individuals, to follow them around the web, and to send them highly personalised political messages. This is a propaganda machine. It’s targeting people individually to recruit them to an idea. It’s a level of social engineering that I’ve never seen before. They’re capturing people and then keeping them on an emotional leash and never letting them go.”\nCambridge Analytica, an American-owned company based in London, was employed by both the Vote Leave campaign and the Trump campaign. Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, has made few public announcements since the Brexit referendum but he did say this: “If you want to make big improvements in communication, my advice is – hire physicists.”\nSteve Bannon, founder of Breitbart News and the newly appointed chief strategist to Trump, is on Cambridge Analytica’s board and it has emerged that the company is in talks to undertake political messaging work for the Trump administration. It claims to have built psychological profiles using 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters. It knows their quirks and nuances and daily habits and can target them individually.\n“They were using 40-50,000 different variants of ad every day that were continuously measuring responses and then adapting and evolving based on that response,” says Martin Moore of Kings College. Because they have so much data on individuals and they use such phenomenally powerful distribution networks, they allow campaigns to bypass a lot of existing laws.\n“It’s all done completely opaquely and they can spend as much money as they like on particular locations because you can focus on a five-mile radius or even a single demographic. Fake news is important but it’s only one part of it. These companies have found a way of transgressing 150 years of legislation that we’ve developed to make elections fair and open.”\nDid such micro-targeted propaganda – currently legal – swing the Brexit vote? We have no way of knowing. Did the same methods used by Cambridge Analytica help Trump to victory? Again, we have no way of knowing. This is all happening in complete darkness. We have no way of knowing how our personal data is being mined and used to influence us. We don’t realise that the Facebook page we are looking at, the Google page, the ads that we are seeing, the search results we are using, are all being personalised to us. We don’t see it because we have nothing to compare it to. And it is not being monitored or recorded. It is not being regulated. We are inside a machine and we simply have no way of seeing the controls. Most of the time, we don’t even realise that there are controls.\nFacebook and Google move to kick fake news sites off their ad networks\nRead more\nRebecca MacKinnon says that most of us consider the internet to be like “the air that we breathe and the water that we drink”. It surrounds us. We use it. And we don’t question it. “But this is not a natural landscape. Programmers and executives and editors and designers, they make this landscape. They are human beings and they all make choices.”\nBut we don’t know what choices they are making. Neither Google or Facebook make their algorithms public. Why did my Google search return nine out of 10 search results that claim Jews are evil? We don’t know and we have no way of knowing. Their systems are what Frank Pasquale describes as “black boxes”. He calls Google and Facebook “a terrifying duopoly of power” and has been leading a growing movement of academics who are calling for “algorithmic accountability”. “We need to have regular audits of these systems,” he says. “We need people in these companies to be accountable. In the US, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, every company has to have a spokesman you can reach. And this is what needs to happen. They need to respond to complaints about hate speech, about bias.”\nIs bias built into the system? Does it affect the kind of results that I was seeing? “There’s all sorts of bias about what counts as a legitimate source of information and how that’s weighted. There’s enormous commercial bias. And when you look at the personnel, they are young, white and perhaps Asian, but not black or Hispanic and they are overwhelmingly men. The worldview of young wealthy white men informs all these judgments.”\nLater, I speak to Robert Epstein, a research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioural Research and Technology, and the author of the study that Martin Moore told me about (and that Google has publicly criticised), showing how search-rank results affect voting patterns. On the other end of the phone, he repeats one of the searches I did. He types “do blacks…” into Google.\n“Look at that. I haven’t even hit a button and it’s automatically populated the page with answers to the query: ‘Do blacks commit more crimes?’ And look, I could have been going to ask all sorts of questions. ‘Do blacks excel at sports’, or anything. And it’s only given me two choices and these aren’t simply search-based or the most searched terms right now. Google used to use that but now they use an algorithm that looks at other things. Now, let me look at Bing and Yahoo. I’m on Yahoo and I have 10 suggestions, not one of which is ‘Do black people commit more crime?’\n“And people don’t question this. Google isn’t just offering a suggestion. This is a negative suggestion and we know that negative suggestions depending on lots of things can draw between five and 15 more clicks. And this all programmed. And it could be programmed differently.”\nWhat Epstein’s work has shown is that the contents of a page of search results can influence people’s views and opinions. The type and order of search rankings was shown to influence voters in India in double-blind trials. There were similar results relating to the search suggestions you are offered.\n“The general public are completely in the dark about very fundamental issues regarding online search and influence. We are talking about the most powerful mind-control machine ever invented in the history of the human race. And people don’t even notice it.”\nGood luck in making Google reveal its algorithm\nJohn Naughton\nRead more\nDamien Tambini, an associate professor at the London School of Economics, who focuses on media regulation, says that we lack any sort of framework to deal with the potential impact of these companies on the democratic process. “We have structures that deal with powerful media corporations. We have competition laws. But these companies are not being held responsible. There are no powers to get Google or Facebook to disclose anything. There’s an editorial function to Google and Facebook but it’s being done by sophisticated algorithms. They say it’s machines not editors. But that’s simply a mechanised editorial function.”\nAnd the companies, says John Naughton, the Observer columnist and a senior research fellow at Cambridge University, are terrified of acquiring editorial responsibilities they don’t want. “Though they can and regularly do tweak the results in all sorts of ways.”\nCertainly the results about Google on Google don’t seem entirely neutral. Google “Is Google racist?” and the featured result – the Google answer boxed out at the top of the page – is quite clear: no. It is not.\nGoogle and Facebook are thinking long term. They have the resources, money and ambition to do whatever they want\nJohn Naughton\nBut the enormity and complexity of having two global companies of a kind we have never seen before influencing so many areas of our lives is such, says Naughton, that “we don’t even have the mental apparatus to even know what the problems are”.\nAnd this is especially true of the future. Google and Facebook are at the forefront of AI. They are going to own the future. And the rest of us can barely start to frame the sorts of questions we ought to be asking. “Politicians don’t think long term. And corporations don’t think long term because they’re focused on the next quarterly results and that’s what makes Google and Facebook interesting and different. They are absolutely thinking long term. They have the resources, the money, and the ambition to do whatever they want.\n“They want to digitise every book in the world: they do it. They want to build a self-driving car: they do it. The fact that people are reading about these fake news stories and realising that this could have an effect on politics and elections, it’s like, ‘Which planet have you been living on?’ For Christ’s sake, this is obvious.”\n“The internet is among the few things that humans have built that they don’t understand.” It is “the largest experiment involving anarchy in history. Hundreds of millions of people are, each minute, creating and consuming an untold amount of digital content in an online world that is not truly bound by terrestrial laws.” The internet as a lawless anarchic state? A massive human experiment with no checks and balances and untold potential consequences? What kind of digital doom-mongerer would say such a thing? Step forward, Eric Schmidt – Google’s chairman. They are the first lines of the book, The New Digital Age, that he wrote with Jared Cohen.\nWe don’t understand it. It is not bound by terrestrial laws. And it’s in the hands of two massive, all-powerful corporations. It’s their experiment, not ours. The technology that was supposed to set us free may well have helped Trump to power, or covertly helped swing votes for Brexit. It has created a vast network of propaganda that has encroached like a cancer across the entire internet. This is a technology that has enabled the likes of Cambridge Analytica to create political messages uniquely tailored to you. They understand your emotional responses and how to trigger them. They know your likes, dislikes, where you live, what you eat, what makes you laugh, what makes you cry.\nAnd what next? Rebecca MacKinnon’s research has shown how authoritarian regimes reshape the internet for their own purposes. Is that what’s going to happen with Silicon Valley and Trump? As Martin Moore points out, the president-elect claimed that Apple chief executive Tim Cook called to congratulate him soon after his election victory. “And there will undoubtedly be be pressure on them to collaborate,” says Moore.\nJournalism is failing in the face of such change and is only going to fail further. New platforms have put a bomb under the financial model – advertising – resources are shrinking, traffic is increasingly dependent on them, and publishers have no access, no insight at all, into what these platforms are doing in their headquarters, their labs. And now they are moving beyond the digital world into the physical. The next frontiers are healthcare, transportation, energy. And just as Google is a near-monopoly for search, its ambition to own and control the physical infrastructure of our lives is what’s coming next. It already owns our data and with it our identity. What will it mean when it moves into all the other areas of our lives?\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: still only 32 years of age. Photograph: Mariana Bazo\/Reuters\n“At the moment, there’s a distance when you Google ‘Jews are’ and get ‘Jews are evil’,” says Julia Powles, a researcher at Cambridge on technology and law. “But when you move into the physical realm, and these concepts become part of the tools being deployed when you navigate around your city or influence how people are employed, I think that has really pernicious consequences.”\nPowles is shortly to publish a paper looking at DeepMind’s relationship with the NHS. “A year ago, 2 million Londoners’ NHS health records were handed over to DeepMind. And there was complete silence from politicians, from regulators, from anyone in a position of power. This is a company without any healthcare experience being given unprecedented access into the NHS and it took seven months to even know that they had the data. And that took investigative journalism to find it out.”\nThe headline was that DeepMind was going to work with the NHS to develop an app that would provide early warning for sufferers of kidney disease. And it is, but DeepMind’s ambitions – “to solve intelligence” – goes way beyond that. The entire history of 2 million NHS patients is, for artificial intelligence researchers, a treasure trove. And, their entry into the NHS – providing useful services in exchange for our personal data – is another massive step in their power and influence in every part of our lives.\nBecause the stage beyond search is prediction. Google wants to know what you want before you know yourself. “That’s the next stage,” says Martin Moore. “We talk about the omniscience of these tech giants, but that omniscience takes a huge step forward again if they are able to predict. And that’s where they want to go. To predict diseases in health. It’s really, really problematic.”\nFor the nearly 20 years that Google has been in existence, our view of the company has been inflected by the youth and liberal outlook of its founders. Ditto Facebook, whose mission, Zuckberg said, was not to be “a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission to make the world more open and connected.”\nThe more we argue with them, the more they know about us. It all feeds into a circular system\nJonathan Albright\nIt would be interesting to know how he thinks that’s working out. Donald Trump is connecting through exactly the same technology platforms that supposedly helped fuel the Arab spring; connecting to racists and xenophobes. And Facebook and Google are amplifying and spreading that message. And us too – the mainstream media. Our outrage is just another node on Jonathan Albright’s data map.\n“The more we argue with them, the more they know about us,” he says. “It all feeds into a circular system. What we’re seeing here is new era of network propaganda.”\nWe are all points on that map. And our complicity, our credulity, being consumers not concerned citizens, is an essential part of that process. And what happens next is down to us. “I would say that everybody has been really naive and we need to reset ourselves to a much more cynical place and proceed on that basis,” is Rebecca MacKinnon’s advice. “There is no doubt that where we are now is a very bad place. But it’s we as a society who have jointly created this problem. And if we want to get to a better place, when it comes to having an information ecosystem that serves human rights and democracy instead of destroying it, we have to share responsibility for that.”\nAre Jews evil? How do you want that question answered? This is our internet. Not Google’s. Not Facebook’s. Not rightwing propagandists.

Determined to use her skills to fight inequality, South African computer scientist Raesetje Sefala set to work to build algorithms flagging poverty hotspots - developing datasets she hopes will help target aid, new housing or clinics.\nFrom crop analysis to medical diagnostics, artificial intelligence (AI) is already used in essential tasks worldwide, but Sefala and a growing number of fellow African developers are pioneering it to tackle their continent's particular challenges.\nLocal knowledge is vital for designing AI-driven solutions that work, Sefala said.\n\"If you don't have people with diverse experiences doing the research, it's easy to interpret the data in ways that will marginalise others,\" the 26-year old said from her home in Johannesburg.\nAfrica is the world's youngest and fastest-growing continent, and tech experts say young, home-grown AI developers have a vital role to play in designing applications to address local problems.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\"For Africa to get out of poverty, it will take innovation and this can be revolutionary, because it's Africans doing things for Africa on their own,\" said Cina Lawson, Togo's minister of digital economy and transformation.\n\"We need to use cutting-edge solutions to our problems, because you don't solve problems in 2022 using methods of 20 years ago,\" Lawson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a video interview from the West African country.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nDigital rights groups warn about AI's use in surveillance and the risk of discrimination, but Sefala said it can also be used to \"serve the people behind the data points\".\nShe mapped out every suburb and township in South Africa and then combined this dataset with satellite data and machine learning algorithms to capture the growth of these neighbourhoods over time.\nShe soon realised the algorithms she had built only went so far because some townships - including where she grew up - were not being correctly predicted.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nBeing able to refine the algorithms based on her lived experience meant the data collected became more accurate.\n\"Those kinds of decisions determine who you alienate or include when you build your AI models,\" said Sefala, the first AI research fellow at the Distributed AI Research (DAIR)institute - a community-driven research group.\n'DELIVERING HELP'\nAs COVID-19 spread around the world in early 2020, government officials in Togo realised urgent action was needed to support informal workers who account for about 80% of the country's workforce, Lawson said.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\"If you decide that everybody stays home, it means that this particular person isn't going to eat that day, it's as simple as that,\" she said.\nIn 10 days, the government built a mobile payment platform - called Novissi - to distribute cash to the vulnerable.\nThe government paired up with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) think tank and the University of California, Berkeley, to build a poverty map of Togo using satellite imagery.\nUsing algorithms with the support of GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that uses AI to distribute cash transfers, the recipients earning less than $1.25 per day and living in the poorest districts were identified for a direct cash transfer.\n\"We texted them saying if you need financial help, please register,\" Lawson said, adding that beneficiaries' consent and data privacy had been prioritised.\nThe entire program reached 920,000 beneficiaries in need.\n\"Machine learning has the advantage of reaching so many people in a very short time and delivering help when people need it most,\" said Caroline Teti, a Kenya-based GiveDirectly director.\n'ZERO REPRESENTATION'\nAiming to boost discussion about AI in Africa, computer scientists Benjamin Rosman and Ulrich Paquet co-founded the Deep Learning Indaba - a week-long gathering that started in South Africa - together with other colleagues in 2017.\n\"You used to get to the top AI conferences and there was zero representation from Africa, both in terms of papers and people, so we're all about finding cost effective ways to build a community,\" Paquet said in a video call.\nIn 2019, 27 smaller Indabas - called IndabaX - were rolled out across the continent, with some events hosting as many as 300 participants.\nOne of these offshoots was IndabaX Uganda, where founder Bruno Ssekiwere said participants shared information on using AI for social issues such as improving agriculture and treating malaria.\nAnother outcome from the South African Indaba was Masakhane - an organisation that uses open-source, machine learning to translate African languages not typically found in online programmes such as Google Translate.\nOn their site, the founders speak about the South African philosophy of \"Ubuntu\" - a term generally meaning \"humanity\" - as part of their organisation's values.\n\"This philosophy calls for collaboration and participation and community,\" reads their site, a philosophy that Ssekiwere, Paquet and Rosman said has now become the driving value for AI research in Africa.\nINCLUSION\nNow that Sefala has built a dataset of South Africa's suburbs and townships, she plans to collaborate with domain experts and communities to refine it, deepen inequality research and improve the algorithms.\n\"Making datasets easily available opens the door for new mechanisms and techniques for policy-making around desegregation, housing, and access to economic opportunity,\" she said.\nAfrican AI leaders say building more complete datasets will also help tackle biases baked into algorithms.\n\"Imagine rolling out Novissi in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Ivory Coast ... then the algorithm will be trained with understanding poverty in West Africa,\" Lawson said.\n\"If there are ever ways to fight bias in tech, it's by increasing diverse datasets ... we need to contribute more,\" she said.\nBut contributing more will require increased funding for African projects and wider access to computer science education and technology in general, Sefala said.\nDespite such obstacles, Lawson said \"technology will be Africa's saviour\".\n\"Let's use what is cutting edge and apply it straight away or as a continent we will never get out of poverty,\" she said. \"It's really as simple as that.\"\nReporting by Kim Harrisberg @KimHarrisberg; Editing by Helen Popper.

The state's top court last year blocked the map as unlawfully biased against Democratic voters.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe legislators had asked the justices to embrace a once-marginal legal theory, called the \"independent state legislature\" doctrine, that would remove any role of state courts and state constitutions in regulating federal elections. Critics of the doctrine, including many legal scholars, Democrats and liberal voting rights advocates, have called it a threat to American democratic norms.\nThe doctrine is based in part on the U.S. Constitution's statement that the \"times, places and manner\" of federal elections \"shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.\"\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\"The Elections Clause does not insulate state legislatures from the ordinary exercise of state judicial review,\" Roberts wrote of that constitutional provision.\nThe ruling still puts the Supreme Court or other federal courts in a position to second-guess state courts in certain types of election-related cases.\nRoberts was joined by fellow conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett as well as the court's three liberal members. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented, saying the case should have been dismissed.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nManipulating electoral district boundaries to marginalize certain voters and increase the influence of others is called gerrymandering. Critics of the doctrine have said its application would let legislatures easily pass further voting restrictions or pursue extreme partisan gerrymandering. The Supreme Court in 2019 barred federal judges from curbing partisan gerrymandering.\nThe doctrine has gained ground among some Republican politicians, who have passed laws and restrictions in numerous states they have said are aimed at combating voter fraud. These efforts accelerated following Republican former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nAbha Khanna, an attorney for some of the map's challengers, hailed Tuesday's ruling as a \"resounding victory for free and fair elections in the United States.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court building is seen in Washington, U.S., April 6, 2023.

A replacement map was in effect for the November 2022 elections.\nThe state court's composition flipped in the November elections from a 4-3 Democratic majority to a 5-2 Republican majority. In April, it overruled its 2022 decision, concluding that state courts do not have the power to rein in electoral map drawing by politicians to entrench one party in power.\nTimothy Moore, the speaker of North Carolina's House of Representatives who defended the Republican-drawn map, said that \"fortunately the current Supreme Court of North Carolina has rectified bad precedent from the previous majority.\"\n\"We will continue to move forward with the redistricting process later this year,\" Moore added.\nElectoral districts are redrawn each decade to reflect population changes as measured by a national census, last taken in 2020. In most states, such redistricting is done by the party in power, which can lead to map manipulation for partisan gain.\nNumerous plaintiffs, including Democratic voters, sued after North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature passed its version of the congressional map in 2021.

It is harassment and blatant misinformation that has been perpetuated.”\nDespite multiple reviews, reports, advisory panels and peer-reviewed studies rejecting claims that its temperature record was biased or flawed, Gallant says the “harassment” of the bureau has continued.\nIn the latest challenge, the Australian newspaper – which over the years has elevated claims from sceptics and bloggers on to its pages – is calling for a “proper, expert appraisal” of temperature records after running claims that mercury thermometers occasionally used by the bureau were recording lower temperatures at one location than newer automatic probes in the same place.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nOne former executive, who for eight years was responsible for the bureau’s main climate record, says the constant criticism has affected the health of scientists over many years, who were diverted from real research to repeatedly answer the same questions.\nCory Bernardi, one of the early critics of the BoM’s use of homogenisation. Photograph: Mike Bowers\/The Guardian\nOne of the earliest formal attacks came in 2010, when the then Liberal senator Cory Bernardi joined sceptics to demand the National Audit Office investigate the internationally-recognised technique known as homogenisation, which aims to remove artificial changes in temperature readings such as if a weather station is moved or buildings are erected that could alter readings.\n‘Fever swamp’ of climate science denial\nA small band of sceptics have long claimed a conspiracy, without evidence, that the bureau deliberately used homogenisation in its centrepiece dataset of 112 weather stations – known as the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network – Surface Air Temperature (Acorn-Sat) – to make the heating of the continent’s climate appear worse.\nEvery minute the BoM spends on this nonsense is a minute lost to managing risk and protecting the community\nFormer bureau boss Rob Vertessy\nThat effort to engage the audit office failed, but the bureau established its own review with a panel of independent international experts.\nThat panel reported that “as the world’s first national-scale homogenised data set of daily temperatures” it had “a high level of confidence in the national temperature trends” from Acorn-Sat.\nAnother independent expert panel reported for three years from 2015 and again backed the bureau’s methods, despite “unsolicited submissions” which they said “do not provide evidence or offer a justification for contesting the overall need for homogenisation and the scientific integrity of the bureau’s climate records.”\nUndeterred, sceptics have continued, sending a barrage of questions to the bureau while publishing blogs that were echoed by multiple stories and opinion pieces in the Murdoch media.\nFormer bureau boss Rob Vertessy, who left the agency in 2016, has said the attacks were pushed by an organised “fever swamp” of climate science denial.\n“Every minute a BoM executive spends on this nonsense is a minute lost to managing risk and protecting the community. It is a real problem,” he told Guardian Australia.\nNeil Plummer worked at the bureau for 33 years, leaving in 2019, and between 2010 and 2018 was the senior executive responsible for Acorn-Sat.\nAustralia’s climate battle has moved on – leaving deniers behind\nMichael Mann\nRead more\n“The answers [from the reviews] should have been very clear,” he says. “There was always a close to zero chance that the bureau had deliberately introduced a warming trend.”\nThe warming trend in Australia is visible in the adjusted and unadjusted data, and Plummer says it also aligns with the warming seen in the ocean around the continent, and with “18 other independent data sets around the world, including from satellites looking at the lower atmosphere”.\nPlummer says from 2010 onwards, a constant stream of “distractions coming from critics” meant leading climate scientists under his charge were having to respond repeatedly to the same questions.\nResidents defend a property from a bushfire at Hillsville near Taree, 350km north of Sydney, in November 2019. Photograph: Peter Parks\/AFP\/Getty Images\n“The cost was high because we were diverting scientists to addressing these very, very specific questions which overall had very little public benefit.”\nPlummer says when the bureau was accused of conspiring to make warming seem worse, he thought it was initially “bizarre and laughable”.\n“But then we heard climate scientists in Australia and overseas were receiving death threats or getting hate messages and there were personal attacks on our own people. Then it gets serious and raised a big concern about where this was all going. Would we end up in some politicised inquiry that was potentially career-ending?\n“My biggest concern was for the health of the climate scientists. They did that work admirably and stuck with it but for a significant number it affected their health and wellbeing and their professional standing. They were concerned it was going to damage their careers.”\nDr Greg Ayers, a former director of the bureau and leading CSIRO atmospheric scientist, has written four peer-reviewed papers testing claims made by sceptics.\nSign up to Afternoon Update\nFree daily newsletter\nOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Mario Tama\/AP\nIn one paper, Ayers, who left the bureau 13 years ago, compared the Acorn-Sat warming trend with four other international data sets that use weather balloons, satellites and raw data from the bureau. In all cases, Ayers found a comparable warming trend.\nOne longstanding bureau critic is Dr Jennifer Marohasy of the rightwing Institute of Public Affairs – the Melbourne-based group that has been a central cog in attempts to deny or undermine human-caused climate change in the eyes of the public since the 1990s.\nFor several years, Marohasy has claimed the bureau’s practice of taking automatic measurements from the final second of each minute breached guidelines from the UN’s World Meteorological Organization, which recommends temperatures should be averaged over a minute.\nBut Ayers and the bureau say the response time of its automatic probes means the recorded measurement is effectively an average of the temperature over the previous 40 seconds to 80s.\nIn another study, Ayers examined if the bureau’s recording method could generate a bias towards higher temperatures.\nAyers took all the data recorded at two locations to see if taking extra readings across a minute made any difference to the temperatures recorded. While tiny differences were found, the study concluded the bureau’s method was “not at risk of bias”.\n‘[Critics] never put their findings into reputable peer-reviewed journals’\nMarohasy, and the Australian, have claimed the bureau’s methods contradict guidance from the WMO, despite previous studies arguing the contrary.\nDr Anthony Rea, a director at the WMO, says the organisation does not audit members but does produce guidelines “and members can implement these in different ways depending on their specific requirements”.\nAnthony Rea, a director at the WMO, says: ‘We all know there are multiple lines of evidence proving that global temperatures are rising, from satellites to ocean buoys to deep sea profilers. All evidence points in the same direction.’ Photograph: Brook Mitchell\/Getty Images\nHe says: “No measurement is perfect, the bureau’s temperature measurements included, but we all know there are multiple lines of evidence proving that global temperatures are rising, from satellites to ocean buoys to deep sea profilers. All evidence points in the same direction.”\nMarohasy says her own analysis of three years of Brisbane airport temperature data shows automatic thermometers record warmer temperatures than parallel mercury probes 41% of the time and are cooler 26% of the time. This, she argues, means “future new record hot days could be a consequence of the probe rather than global warming”.\nBut scientists and the bureau say it was never possible – and it was never claimed by them – that mercury probes recorded the exact same temperatures as automatic probes.\nThe bureau has analysed the same Brisbane data, finding the maximum daily temperatures recorded manually by the “liquid-in-glass” mercury probes were on average only 0.02C cooler than automatic probes across three years. For minimum daily temperatures, the manual probes were 0.02C warmer than the automatic probes.\nI don’t even know what [the sceptics] are trying to highlight\nDr Ailie Gallant\nA bureau statement said: “There is no significant systematic difference in maximum and minimum temperatures, or the [daily] temperature range, or the effective response time of measurement, observed using mercury thermometers compared with platinum resistance probes.”\nGallant says: “I don’t even know what [the sceptics] are trying to highlight. That there are differences in measurements? We know that already and we take that into account.\n“Some people might ask why can’t the temperature record be scrutinised? Scrutiny is part of the scientific process, but [critics] never put their findings into reputable peer-reviewed journals. The bureau has done this. Scientists have done this, and they all show the same thing.\n“It’s just someone’s opinion until it’s published. That’s why I would argue this is harassment. They need to put up or shut up.”\nThe Guardian sent questions to The Australian, but did not receive a response.\nIn an 11-page response to questions, Marohasy defended her claims and said she intended to publish responses to the work of Ayers and to publish details of her current work on mercury probes with her IPA colleague, Dr John Abbot.\nShe said it was true that she had “pursued this issue with the bureau and some members of its staff for close to a decade”, adding: “But if they had acknowledged the genuine issue and the public interest in sharing the data, in say, 2015, we could have moved on.”\n“There has been no harassment on our part,” she said. Because the bureau had initially refused to release the Brisbane data from mercury probes, leaving her and Abbot to resort to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to get the information, “the harassment, obstruction and misinformation has been by the bureau”.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of Digital map bias.

Through this system, it's the other way around.\"\nThe once-a-decade process of redistricting has long been a back-room affair in many states, with lawmakers carving out skewed, politically advantageous voting districts with the help of proprietary software that can sort voters down to the individual block.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nAs states begin the 2021 redistricting cycle, however, legislators face a powerful new check: a suite of freely accessible map-making tools that allow ordinary citizens to draw their own lines and evaluate those proposed by lawmakers for any partisan bias.\nAdvocacy groups say the new technologies are transforming their fight against gerrymandering, a tactic used by one political party to manipulate district lines to maintain power.

Control of the House - where the Democrats hold a narrow majority - could be decided simply through redistricting.

Other people just want to be listened to. Others just want to change things. We have seen over recent years much more polarisation in public debate, so it would be surprising if we, a body that is a receptacle for views of the general public, didn’t reflect that heightened debate.”\nBaxter is the man who ultimately sits as the top judge in what has inadvertently become a quasi-judicial arbitration system for culture war disputes. He said his team of 40 had seen an explosion of feedback during the last year, fuelled by Covid-19 and social media campaigns. Whereas in the 2019-20 financial year they received 34,545 complaints from members of the public about alleged breaches of the broadcasting code, during 2020-21 it had more than 145,000 complaints – and these figures exclude BBC content.\nHe said feedback increasingly touched on issues around racial bias. “You get people taking a viewpoint that there’s content that’s detrimental about racial minority. We also get people who make comments that could be characterised as ‘all lives matter’. That’s a reflection on the debates at a wider level.”\nAlthough Baxter is clear his role is to ignore the noise, favour freedom of expression, and ensure compliance with the high standards of the UK broadcasting code – 95% of complaints are quickly assessed and dismissed – the decisions produced by him and his team have wider cultural significance.\nLast summer his team declined to investigate 24,500 complaints about a Black Lives Matter-inspired dance performance by the group Diversity on the ITV talent show Britain’s Got Talent. Ofcom’s lengthy explanation of why the performance did not break any broadcast rules discussed societal issues such as anti-white racism and whether racism is an appropriate topic for children.\nThis case also showed that complaints are increasingly made by people who didn’t watch the programmes. Just 4% of the 24,500 complaints about the performance were made in the immediate aftermath of Britain’s Got Talent being aired. Instead, the majority followed news stories about the relatively small number of original complaints to Ofcom, which in turn prompted even more complaints, and in turn more news stories, producing a self-perpetuating media outrage cycle.\nThe Guardian has learned that, following this and similar incidents, Ofcom has decided to stop providing journalists with daily running totals of the complaints it has received about major shows, partly due to concerns about stoking such coverage and also due to the amount of staff work required.\nAlthough it’s easy to dismiss complainers as green ink letter writers, they can have real power over the operation of our media. Analysis by the Guardian has previously found that the BBC received more complaints from rightwingers than leftwingers during the last general election. Programme makers may be tempted to ignore topics which will leave them tied up in knots with lengthy investigations. In 2019 a single persistent complainant who objected to Munchetty’s comments about Donald Trump created a major BBC scandal and open rebellion among the BBC’s staff.\nIt also provides simplicity in a world of chaos. Compared with the largely unregulated online media, a complaint about a TV broadcast will ultimately result in a binary yes or no decision about whether it broke any rules.\nPeter Lunt, a professor of media and communication at the University of Leicester, said the rapidly increasing number of complaints pointed towards a clash of online and offline political media cultures. On the internet individuals get attention for their political arguments by shouting louder and asserting their opinions in ever stronger terms. By comparison, the BBC believes its duty is to give a balanced commentary of different views that are circulating.\nHe said the BBC’s complaints system – designed for people who take issue with specific programming decisions – had been appropriated for a different purpose by people who want to vent and express indignation. “The logic of the complaints system is not fit for purpose because it’s based on a consumer satisfaction model rather than a citizenship concern model.”\nHe said the record number of complaints about coverage of Prince Philip’s death obscured why they were complaining: “You could say they didn’t like it because they couldn’t watch the final of MasterChef. But if you look at the citizenship side, people were concerned about the blanket coverage. What was being questioned was something deeper – why did the BBC think they had to do that?\n“This was not just consumer dissatisfaction, it was an expression of currents of public opinion.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses the increase in complaints received by the BBC and the media regulator Ofcom, with a particular focus on issues related to racial bias.

{"num":58,"Time":null,"Title":"U.S. Supreme Court's Alabama voting map ruling maintains a dire status quo","Content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court’s unexpected decision on Thursday to uphold the basic provisions of the Voting Rights Act has been described in some corners as a move to strengthen democracy and a victory for Black voters, with some reports even casting certain justices as saviors of the seminal civil rights law.\nThe ruling actually preserves an already-dire status quo for minority voting rights established by the court itself. And it all but confirms the charges that Alabama reacted to its growing Black population with a brazen, public effort to exclude those residents from political power via racial gerrymandering.\nIt’s also worth inspecting what the opinion actually does, alongside what the justices decided not to do: The justices affirmed a lower court’s ruling that a Republican-backed congressional map diluted the voting power of Black residents in Alabama, and it ordered state officials to redraw the maps.\nThe ruling will presumably reinstate Black Alabamians’ rightful scope of electoral representation – but it does so after those voters were already subjected to the discriminatory maps during elections in May and November of last year. It also means another likely discriminatory map that was used in Louisiana after the court’s intervention might be similarly redrawn.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nAlabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour and a representative in the Alabama Attorney General's office did not immediately respond to a request for comments about the decision.\nMost observers expected the court’s conservatives to narrow Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which includes the law’s general prohibition against race discrimination in voting practices and procedures, but Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Brett Kavanaugh joined the court’s three liberals in declining to do so.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe decision reestablishes that the law only requires plaintiffs to show that election practices have biased effects, as opposed to proving that legislators intended to discriminate. And it firmly rejected the notion that the Constitution doesn’t allow any consideration of race -- including in terms of remedying past and present racial discrimination -- when drawing electoral maps.\nThose are meaningful developments, to be sure, but hardly a cause to celebrate, in my view. The opinion simply doesn’t do much to change the regressive path the court has taken on minority voting rights.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nFirst, the court didn’t strengthen the law in any sense. Indeed, Roberts goes to some length to point out that the ruling rests on a nearly 40-year-old interpretation of the 1965 Act and doesn’t disturb existing law.\nThat precedent, from a 1986 case called Thornburg v. Gingles created a three-part test to show that an electoral law or practice that has led to unequal opportunities based on race is outlawed under Section 2 of the Act.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nReport this ad\n“The heart of these cases is not about the law as it exists. It is about Alabama’s attempt to remake our [voting rights] jurisprudence anew,” Roberts said, referring to the state’s argument for a “color-blind” evaluation of voting discrimination claims.\nThat understanding “would require abandoning four decades of the Court’s” precedents, Robert wrote, adding that the approach Alabama was urging is impractical.\nNot only did the Alabama ruling not advance existing law, but the Supreme Court has virtually every other vital provision in the Voting Rights Act, and the Gingles standard it left in tact on Thursday is itself deeply flawed.\nRoberts’ majority opinion acknowledges that point — citing an amicus brief by law professors and political scientists which highlighted that the court’s Voting Rights Act decisions have caused most plaintiffs to lose their cases.\nLitigation under Section 2 “has rarely been successful” for discrimination plaintiffs, Roberts wrote, noting that “plaintiffs nationwide have apparently succeeded in fewer than ten” racial vote dilution lawsuits since 2010, out of 31 overall.\nThe number of wins is actually inflated, and many other potential plaintiffs with racial vote dilution claims simply don’t bother to file lawsuits, according to the brief. “Why is Section 2’s reach so limited? The essential answer is that this Court has already imposed a series of doctrinal constraints on the provision’s operation,” the professors wrote.\nIn fact, up until 2006 the court didn’t issue a full opinion holding that a redistricting plan diluted minority voting power under Section 2, despite critical amendments having being enacted in 1982, Richard Pildes wrote in a 2007 paper. Pildes is a professor at the New York University School of Law.\nThe Supreme Court stopped short of abrogating the basic anti-bias provision of one of the most successful pieces of civil rights legislation, but that can hardly be described as a victory for minority voting rights.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

{"num":70,"Time":"Wed 5 Jun 2019 11.00 CEST","Title":"Do mapping apps need a 'night-safe mode' for women?","Content":"G\net home safe!” are words carved in most women’s vocabulary. We usually say it in the evening, when it’s dark – to our friend leaving a house party, to our sister getting a bus home after a dinner, or a colleague going home after a late shift. And then, a short while later, we open WhatsApp to a new message that reads: “Did you get home safe?”\nIt may just be another part of how we bid farewell at the end of the night. But it’s also a reminder of how, when we’re alone in a town or city at night, our safety is no guarantee.\nWhile there’s much we can do to stay safe by taking sensible precautions, could our phones also help?\nApps that address traveller safety are not new. In the past, they’ve often focused on cities, and relied on crowd-sourcing information from users. Some apps send users push notifications to alert them of reported crimes that are close by. Others have asked users to submit personal experiences of verbal attacks or assaults.\nBut what’s been missing from the tech industry’s approach to safety is a focus on route-mapping catered to women.\nA part of this problem is clear: there are fewer women than men leading product and design decisions. And so as long as the industry is still mostly male-dominated, the issue of women’s safety is less likely at the forefront of the minds of those developing travel apps.\nAnd nowhere could this be more apparent than the most popular travel apps used by millions of people living in cities every day.\nGoogle Maps and CityMapper are apps which offer the quickest, most convenient route to a destination. However, neither app offers an option for safety, or “night” mode. This may seem like an unfair request, or too demanding of an ask. But CityMapper already offers a “rain safe” and “step-free” mode, even a “cold safe” mode. And when you consider both apps often offer routes to users that direct them down pitch-black paths at night, an option that at least considered street lighting wouldn’t go amiss.\nA greater focus on safer routes at night has been flagged by concerned users for years. Most recently, a woman tweeted her experience, saying CityMapper’s suggested route left her stranded, after she missed the last train home. Lil Patuck, who works in tech herself, said if CityMapper had told her it was the last train, she‘d have taken the bus, and would have avoided walking alone. The app then directed her through deserted roads and “dark, creepy alleyways” late at night.\nPauck tweeted: “Whoever leads, tech needs sensitive responsible design – ie rather than telling a user to ‘go catch this train’, also tell them: ‘It’s the last one – are you sure? Here’s a safe alternative.’”\nWhile CityMapper and Google Maps haven’t announced plans to introduce any form of “safe” or “night” mode for users, others in the tech space are trying to answer safety concerns for women.\nIn the US, Lexie Ernst and Jake Wayne founded the app Companion, which lets you enter a destination, and then add friends and family to monitor your journey home. The duo created the app for both men and women in mind, and while it doesn’t provide a safe route option, it does allow users to request help from those nearby, and be able to call 911 with one tap.\nAnd last year, Jillian Kowalchuk, 32, launched the app Safe & The City, aimed at women. The app rates routes based on practical elements, such as street safety and lighting, whether nearby businesses are open, and if crimes have been reported to the police in the area.\nKowalchuk has spoken about the challenges she faced in developing an app concerning women’s safety, and as a founder. “As a female founder I often find I am one of a few in the tech sector. I have found it a challenge. I was a bit naive about the ecosystem I was coming into – I had a few situations where I was sexually harassed by investors or developers.”\nKowalchuk is hoping to fill a void in the tech space, listening to women and building on their feedback.\nStill, while some women are addressing gender-specific safety concerns in the tech space, the launch of previous safety apps has shown us there’s still a need for women from different backgrounds and ethnicities to be behind the making of these apps, too.\nIn 2014, the app SketchFactor launched, allowing users to report having seen or experienced something, or seen someone, they deemed to be “sketchy” in a particular location, and add their rating, so users can then avoid those areas.\nThe app caused huge controversy in the US, as critics argued the term “sketchy” is a dog whistle for “minorities”, and what users interpreted as “sketchy” would encourage racial profiling. The two founders, who are white, denied their app would be used by other white people to avoid black neighbourhoods.\nIncluding reported crime incidents is one thing for tech founders to consider in their app. But asking users to rate the “trustworthiness” of the people around them, or of a neighbourhood – like the Safe & The City app encourages – is at risk of facing the same criticism SketchFactor faced.\nA safety app isn’t a sure-fire way to protect women from a possible attack or assault. And a “night mode” isn’t going to stop women from being followed or harassed. But to have these tools – and to have a more diverse pool of women behind the making of them – would still be useful. So the next time we tell a friend “get home safe” at the end of a night, we can be somewhat less worrisome.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses the need for mapping apps to have a 'night-safe mode' specifically aimed at ensuring women's safety when traveling alone at night.

Sometimes this information is easy to understand and put in context, but, at other times, it requires regulatory and technical knowledge to understand the information.\nA vast amount of information is publicly available through this \"environmental big data,\" and community groups are empowered more than ever to use that data to support environmental improvement, positive community investment, and better overall community health. With this backdrop, companies need to be thoughtful about how environmental data is managed, including the legal benefits and risks of disclosure.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nWhile environmental big data puts wind in the advocacy sails of citizens and community activists, it also offers companies an opportunity to strategically manage in-house data and information to thoughtfully and accurately reflect a company's environmental impacts.\nShareholders and other investors are closely analyzing publicly available data to assess company performance, and there is a heightened expectation that companies will take tangible steps to reduce environmental impacts from operations. This requires understanding local community demographics and impacts, as well as supply chain and downstream corporate impacts, particularly in light of the Environmental, Social, Governance (\"ESG\") movement. What that environmental data shows, including the inferences and conclusions that may be drawn from it, can help corporate leadership to proactively anticipate and mitigate potential liability, and identify areas of opportunity for investment.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe significance of this environmental big data is not lost on governmental agencies. The Biden administration has committed itself to making innovative use of big data, including demographic information, such as household income, hospital admission rates, and environmental emissions to support policy, funding and enforcement initiatives focused on communities that have been historically marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nFor the administration, big data is even coming from the sky, as EPA announced on Jan. 25, 2022, that it plans to enhance its air monitoring capacity using its ASPECT plane equipped with a suite of sensors and software.\nThe administration is also relying on existing and new databases to accomplish its goals, including:\n•EJSCREEN Database. One of the most prominent environmental databases is the EJSCREEN (Environmental Justice) Mapping Tool, run by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), which was first made publicly available in 2016. EJSCREEN presents data from other federal databases for 11 different environmental indicators focused on exposure and\/or proximity to pollutants, risk or hazards and six demographic indicators including income, race and education. Graphically, the data can be viewed as separate or overlapping layers. The EJSCREEN tool allows a user to see how different environmental burdens impact various communities. Notably, however, the mapping tool does not support analysis of the cumulative impact of those burdens on a specific community. EPA, in the Biden administration, has made a commitment to increase data monitoring, train staff on EJSCREEN, and facilitate data sharing and related enforcement across agencies.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n•ECHO Database. EPA's Enforcement and Compliance History Online (\"ECHO\") tool is publicly accessible and contains information related to regulated facilities' permit data, inspection\/compliance findings, environmental violations and enforcement actions. Notably, facility summaries on ECHO provide related EJSCREEN community data and demographic profiles.\n•Climate and Environmental Justice Screening Tool. The Biden administration has focused on leveraging existing data contained in EJSCREEN, ECHO and other federal databases with the development of a new geospatial tool called the Climate and Environmental Justice Screening Tool. The mapping tool will integrate broader data sets to better identify overall environmental and climate risks for communities that have been historically marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution. The tool, which was originally supposed to be rolled out last year, is still in development but is intended to facilitate various goals of the administration, including funding priorities and enforcement.\nState and local governments have also made a treasure trove of environmental and social data available. California's own mapping tool CalEnviroScreen, which EJSCREEN was modeled after, contains state data and, unlike its federal counterpart, provides a cumulative impact score for each census tract, making it easy to identify disadvantaged communities for investment opportunities and enhanced enforcement under state law.\nOther states have similar geospatial tools, including Colorado, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, North Carolina, and Virginia.\nSimilarly, community organizations and non-governmental organizations have created public repositories containing locally gathered or compiled information. These organizations train employees and volunteers to collect data, including water, air, and soil samples.\nThese databases can be important resources for various stakeholders, including companies, to direct resources, prioritize areas of concern, and spur regulatory action:\n•PurpleAir provides affordable air monitors for use by citizen scientists to collect real-time air quality data and share that data using a digital map accessible on the organization's website. This site has been widely used during the California wildfire season to track air quality.\n•Bloomwatch allows citizens to upload photos of possible harmful algal blooms with the goal of protecting recreational users and bringing compromised waters to regulators' attention.\n•Propublica provides an interactive map, which relies on existing EPA data, to identify areas with significant emissions and associated cancer risk, as calculated by the organization.\nCollectively, these databases are designed to be easy tools for users, whether corporate, government or individual, to understand practical implications of environmental big data and take informed action. It is worth noting that, for companies, big data can be used to inform corporate ESG goals and reporting. See \"ESG Trends: Improving and Standardizing Disclosure,\" Reuters Legal News.\nOverall, for any entity in today's data-saturated world, it is important to understand that navigating and leveraging big data are fundamental to achieving strategic goals.\nNadira Clarke, a partner at the firm, contributed to this article.\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

In most states, such redistricting is done by the party in power, which can lead to map manipulation for partisan gain. Voting rights litigation that could result in new maps of congressional districts is playing out in several states.\nThe Supreme Court in its 5-4 June ruling ordered state lawmakers to add a second House district with a Black majority - or close to it - in order to comply with the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting. Black voters tend to favor Democratic candidates.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nFollowing that ruling, the legislature adopted a plan that increased the portion of Black voters in a second House district from around 30% to 40%, still well below a majority. The three-judge panel on Tuesday ruled that the new map failed to remedy the Voting Rights Act violation present in the first map and directed a special master - an independent party appointed by a court - to draw a new, third version of the map ahead of next year's congressional elections.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe latest Republican-drawn map drew swift objections from Black voters and civil rights activists.

{"num":81,"Time":"Mon 29 Jul 2019 07.00 CEST","Title":"What is facial recognition - and how sinister is it?","Content":"What is facial recognition?\nFacial recognition technology has spread prodigiously. It’s there on Facebook, tagging photos from the class reunion, your cousin’s wedding and the office summer party. Google, Microsoft, Apple and others have built it into apps to compile albums of people who hang out together.\nIt verifies who you are at airports and is the latest biometric to unlock your mobile phone where facial recognition apps abound. Need to confirm your identity for a £1,000 bank transfer? Just look into the camera.\nNew applications crop up all the time. Want to know who’s at the door? A video doorbell with facial recognition will tell you, provided you’ve uploaded a photo of the person’s face. Other systems are used to spot missing persons and catch slackers who lie about the hours they spend in the office. Advertisers, of course, are in on the act. Thanks to facial recognition, billboards can now serve up ads based on an estimate of your sex, age and mood.\nThat sounds quite Big Brother. Is it a surveillance tool?\nSometimes, yes. China uses facial recognition for racial profiling and its tracking and control of the Uighur muslims has been roundly condemned as a shameful first for a government.Its cameras also spot and fine jaywalkers, verify students at school gates, and monitor their expressions in lessons to ensure they are paying attention.\nRussia has embraced the technology too. In Moscow, video cameras scan the streets for “people of interest” and plans have been mooted to equip the police with glasses that work the same way.\nThere have been reports that Israel is using facial recognition for covert tracking of Palestinians deep inside the West Bank. Meanwhile in Britain, the Metropolitan and South Wales police forces have trialled facial recognition to find people in football and rugby crowds, on city streets, and at commemorations and music festivals. Taylor Swift even installed the tech at a gig in California to weed out stalkers.\nShops are increasingly installing the technology to deter and catch thieves. Next year, it will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo.\nHow did it get everywhere?\nAdvances in three technical fields have played a major part: big data, deep convolutional neural networks and powerful graphics processing units or GPUs.\nThanks to Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, Google and others, the internet holds billions of photos of people’s faces which have been scraped together into massive image datasets. They are used to train deep neural networks, a mainstay of modern artificial intelligence, to detect and recognise faces. The computational grunt work is often done on GPUs, the superfast chips that are dedicated to graphics processing. But there is more to it than flashy new technology. Over the past decade in particular, facial recognition systems have been deployed all over the place, and the data gathered from them has helped companies hone their technology.\nHow does it work?\nFirst off, the computer has to learn what a face is. This can be done by training an algorithm, usually a deep neural network, on a vast number of photos that have faces in known positions. Each time the algorithm is presented with an image, it estimates where the face is. The network will be rubbish at first, like a drunk playing pin the tail on the donkey. But if this is done multiple times, the algorithm improves and eventually masters the art of spotting a face. This is the face detection step.\nNext up is the recognition part. This is done in various ways, but it’s common to use a second neural network. It is fed a series of face pictures and learns – over many rounds – how best to tell one from another. Some algorithms explicitly map the face, measuring the distances between the eyes, nose and mouth and so on. Others map the face using more abstract features. Either way, the network outputs a vector for each face – a string of numbers that uniquely identifies the person among all the others in the training set.\nIn live deployments, the software goes to work on video footage in real time. The computer scans frames of video usually captured at crowd pinch points, such as entrances to football stadiums. It first detects the faces in a frame, then churns out vectors for each one. The face vectors are then checked against those for people on a watchlist. Any matches that clear a preset threshold are then ranked and displayed. In the British police trials a typical threshold for a match was 60%, but the bar can be set higher to reduce false positives.\nIt’s not the only way the police use facial recognition. If a suspect has been picked up, officers can upload their mugshot and search CCTV footage to potentially trace the suspect’s movements back to the scene of a crime.\nHow accurate is it?\nThe best systems are impressive. Independent tests by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist) found that between 2014 and 2018 facial recognition systems got 20 times better at finding a match in a database of 12m portrait photos. The failure rate fell from 4% to 0.2% over the period, a massive gain in accuracy that was largely down to deep neural networks. Nist says the networks have driven “an industrial revolution” in facial recognition.\nBut such great performance depends on ideal conditions: where a crisp and clear mugshot of an unknown person is checked against a database of other high quality photos. In the real world, images can be blurred or poorly lit, people look away from the camera, or may have a scarf over their face, or be much older than in their reference photo. All tend to reduce the accuracy.\nThe technology has a terrible time with twins, the Nist tests found, with even the best algorithms muddling them up.\nWhat about bias?\nBias has long plagued facial recognition algorithms. The problem comes about when neural networks are trained on different numbers of faces from different groups of people. So if a system is trained on a million white male faces, but fewer women and people of colour, it will be less accurate for the latter groups. Less accuracy means more misidentifications and potentially more people being wrongly stopped and questioned.\nLast year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) found that Amazon’s Rekognition software wrongly identified 28 members of Congress as people who had previously been arrested. It disproportionately misidentified African-Americans and Latinos. Amazon said the ACLU had used the wrong settings.\nPolice trials have highlighted further shortcomings of facial recognition. A Cardiff University review of the South Wales trials found that the force’s NEC NeoFace system froze, lagged and crashed when the screen was full of people and performed worse on gloomy days and in the late afternoon because the cameras ramped up their light sensitivity, making footage more “noisy”.\nDuring 55 hours of deployment the system flagged up 2,900 potential matches of which 2,755 were false positives. The police made 18 arrests using the system, but the Cardiff report does not state whether any of the individuals were charged.\nThe Welsh trial highlighted another challenge for facial recognition: lambs. Not farmyard fugitives but people on the watchlist who happen look like plenty of other people. While scanning the crowds at Welsh rugby matches, the NeoFace system spotted one woman on the South Wales police watch list 10 times. None of them were her.\nWho has the technology?\nTech firms around the world are developing facial recognition but the US, Russia, China, Japan, Israel and Europe lead the way. Some nations have embraced the technology more readily than others.\nChina has millions of cameras connected to facial recognition software and Russia has declared hopes to expand its own surveillance networks. In Europe, as elsewhere, facial recognition has found its way into shops to spot thieves and into businesses to monitor staff and visitors, but live face recognition in public spaces is still mostly at trial stage.\nIn the US, the police typically use facial recognition to search CCTV footage for suspects rather than scanning live crowds. But it is becoming more pervasive. A 2016 report from Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology found that half of all Americans are in police facial recognition databases, meaning that algorithms pick suspects from virtual line-ups of 117 million mostly law-abiding citizens.\nWhat does the law say on it?\nNot much. In Britain there is no law that gives the police the power to use facial recognition and no government policy on its use. This has led to what Paul Wiles, the Biometrics commissioner, calls a chaotic situation with the police deciding for themselves where and when it is appropriate to use facial recognition and what happens to the images the cameras capture.\nThe campaign group, Liberty, has called for a complete ban on live facial recognition systems in public spaces, arguing that it destroys privacy and forces people to change their behaviour. The group has brought a judicial review against South Wales police over its use of the technology. Similar concerns were raised by the University of Essex in an independent review of the Metropolitan police force’s use of facial recognition. It found that people were wrongly stopped, and warned of “surveillance creep” where the technology ends up being used to track people who are not wanted by the courts. Live facial recognition, the report concluded, was likely to fall foul of human rights law.\nAnother area of contention is watchlists. Despite a 2012 high court ruling that retaining images of innocent people was unlawful, the police have steadily built up a custody database of 20 million people, many of whom have never been convicted of a crime. Nonetheless, images from the database, and others scraped from social media, are used to create watchlists for use in facial recognition systems. In the private sector, the situation is even murkier, with shops and businesses deciding who goes on secret watchlists, and sharing images with other firms.\nIn the US the situation is not much better. Only five states have laws that touch on the use of facial recognition by law enforcement. The patchwork of laws means that while the Seattle police force and San Francisco city have banned live facial recognition, the sheriff’s office in Maricopa County, Arizona, uploaded the photo and driver’s licence of every resident in Honduras to its facial recognition watchlist.\nWhat about other biometrics\nWhile facial recognition technology has drawn huge attention, the police and other organisations are looking carefully at new biometrics, beyond fingerprints and DNA, that uniquely identify people.\nSkin texture analysis is said to overcome problems with facial recognition caused by different expressions and partially covered faces by analysing the distance between skin pores. It has not been tested much, but developers claim it could be good enough to distinguish between twins.\nAnother biometric that interests the police, because it can be done at a distance without a person’s cooperation, is gait analysis. As the name suggests, the algorithms identify people by the unique style of their stride, reflecting differences in anatomy, genetics, social background, habits and personality.\nWith vein recognition, optical scanners are used to map blood vessels in the hand, finger or eye. Because our veins are buried beneath the skin, the scanners are considered hard to fool. Fujitsu’s PalmSecure system uses vein maps to monitor the to and fro of employees at various businesses.\nSpeaker recognition is already used by banks and the HMRC to confirm people’s identities and its use is spreading. Unlike speech recognition, which translates sounds to words, speaker recognition detects the unique acoustic patterns created by an individual’s vocal tract and their speech habits.\nWhat next?\nUbiquity, perhaps. The US firm, Vuzix, has teamed up with a Dubai firm, NNTC, to produce facial recognition smart glasses. The frames hold a tiny eight-megapixel camera which scans the faces of passers-by and alerts the wearer to any matches in a database of a million people. In Britain, Wireless CCTV is working on police body cameras that do much the same thing. A recent US patent goes further and describes a police bodycam that starts recording when the face of a suspect is spotted.\nMeanwhile, tech firms are improving their systems to work faster, with more faces, and with ever-more-difficult images, such as those taken in bad light or when people have their faces covered. Though still in its infancy, work is under way on algorithms that can identify people wearing masks and other disguises. To make recognition systems even more effective, face biometrics will be combined with others such as voice and gait, according to the Home Office’s 2018 Biometrics Strategy. Unsurprisingly, an arms race is afoot: researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have developed their own sunglasses to fool facial recognition: one male researcher who wore a pair was identified as Milla Jovovich.\nFurther reading\nOur Biometric Future: Facial Recognition Technology and the Culture of Surveillance Kelly A Gates\nFuture Crimes Marc Goodman\nPrivacy in the Face of Surveillance: Fourth Amendment Considerations for Facial Recognition Technology Naval Postgraduate School\nHandbook of Face Recognition Stan Z Li and Anil K Jain\nFace: A Visual Odyssey Jessica Helfand (published December)","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses facial recognition technology and its widespread use in various applications, including social media tagging, airport security, mobile phone unlocking, video doorbells, and advertising.

{"num":87,"Time":"Thu 8 Jun 2023 18.52 CEST","Title":"Alabama discriminated against Black voters, US supreme court rules","Content":"Alabama discriminated against Black voters when it drew its seven congressional districts last year, the supreme court has ruled, a decision that is a major victory for the Voting Rights Act (VRA).\nThe decision was 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the court’s three liberal justices in the opinion. Writing for the majority of the court, Roberts noted the court was rejecting Alabama’s effort to get it to rewrite its longstanding interpretation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race. The decision means that section 2 of the law, one of its last remaining powerful provisions, will remain intact.\n“The heart of these cases is not about the law as it exists. It is about Alabama’s attempt to remake our §2 jurisprudence anew,” Roberts wrote. “We find Alabama’s new approach to §2 compelling neither in theory nor in practice. We accordingly decline to recast our §2 case law as Alabama requests.”\nThe decision was an unexpected outcome from Roberts and the court, both of whom have significantly hollowed out the Voting Rights Act in recent years. As a young lawyer in the justice department in the 1980s, Roberts argued for narrowing the interpretation of section 2. The court has rarely sided with voting rights litigants who allege voting discrimination.\nThe decision in the case, Allen v Milligan, means that Alabama will have to draw its congressional map to include a second majority-Black district. Black voters currently comprise a majority of the voting age population in just one district, despite making up a quarter of the state’s population.\n“This decision is a crucial win against the continued onslaught of attacks on voting rights,” Deuel Ross, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “Alabama attempted to rewrite federal law by saying race had no place in redistricting. But because of the state’s sordid and well-documented history of racial discrimination, race must be used to remedy that past and ensure communities of color are not boxed out of the electoral process.”\nThe ruling also is a boon to similar cases in Louisiana, Texas and Georgia, where litigants currently are suing to require the drawing of additional majority-minority districts. “This precedent also lays a foundation for fair map decisions in our other Section 2 cases,” said Marina Jenkins, the executive director of the National Redistricting Foundation, a Democratic-aligned group that is involved in those cases.\nAlabama could have easily drawn a second majority-Black district, the challengers in the case argued. They offered several sample maps with possible configurations of how to do so. Last year, a three-judge panel unanimously agreed with that argument and ordered the state to do so. The panel, which included two judges appointed by Donald Trump, said the question of whether the state had violated the law was “not a close one”.\nNotably, the majority rejected an argument from Alabama that it should only be required to draw an additional majority-Black district if the plaintiffs could prove it was required without considering race. That theory would have made it extremely difficult for plaintiffs to show discrimination had occurred in redistricting against minority voters.\n“This court has long recognized – and as all members of this court today agree – the text of §2 establishes an effects test, not an intent test,” Kavanaugh wrote in a concurring opinion. “The effects test, as applied by Gingles to redistricting, requires in certain circumstances that courts account for the race of voters so as to prevent the cracking or packing – whether intentional or not – of large and geographically compact minority populations.”\nJoe Biden praised the court’s decision and said he and Vice-President Kamala Harris would continue to push Congress to restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. The US supreme court, in a 5-4 opinion authored by Roberts in 2013, gutted a key provision of the law that required states with a history of voting discrimination to get voting changes pre-cleared by the federal government before they went into effect.\n“The right to vote and have that vote counted is sacred and fundamental – it is the right from which all of our other rights spring. Key to that right is ensuring that voters pick their elected officials – not the other way around,” the president said in a statement. “Today’s decision confirms the basic principle that voting practices should not discriminate on account of race, but our work is not done.”\nMerrick Garland, the US attorney general, praised the decision in a statement.\n“Today’s decision rejects efforts to further erode fundamental voting rights protections, and preserves the principle that in the United States, all eligible voters must be able to exercise their constitutional right to vote free from discrimination based on their race,” he said. “The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, the right from which all other rights ultimately flow.”\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined at various parts by fellow conservative justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. The supreme court has long misinterpreted section 2, he wrote, restating his prior view that it does not even apply to redistricting cases. He also wrote that the majority opinion required too much consideration of race in drawing district lines and urged a more race-neutral approach.\n“As applied here, the amended §2 thus falls on the wrong side of ‘the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law’,” Thomas wrote. “It replaces the constitutional right against intentionally discriminatory districting with an amorphous race-based right to a ‘fair’ distribution of political power, a ‘right’ that cannot be implemented without requiring the very evils the constitution forbids.”\nAlito, writing separately in dissent, also said that the plaintiffs advocating for an additional majority-minority district “must show at the outset that such a district can be created without making race the predominant factor in its creation”.\n“Today’s decision unnecessarily sets the VRA on a perilous and unfortunate path,” he wrote.\nThe supreme court intervened in February 2022 on an emergency request and allowed Alabama’s maps to go into effect for the 2022 elections. Even though Alabama’s election was not until the end of May, the court said it was too close to the election to upend the map.\nAlabama had argued that the lower court had wrongly decided the case by taking race too much into account. The challengers in the case should have been required to show that they could draw a second majority-Black district without considering race at all, Edmund LaCour, the state’s solicitor general, said during oral argument last year.\nThe case was seen as a “textbook” example of the kind of discrimination in redistricting that section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was designed to prevent. The provision outlaws any voting practice that discriminates on the basis of race and litigants have frequently used it to challenge electoral maps that make it harder for minorities to elect the candidate of their choice. It was widely understood to be the most powerful remaining provision in the landmark civil rights law after the US supreme court’s 2013 decision in Shelby County v Holder. That decision blocked another part of the landmark civil rights law requiring states with a history of voting discrimination to get their changes approved by the federal government.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"Alabama discriminated against Black voters when it drew its seven congressional districts last year, as ruled by the US Supreme Court.

It is not, and has never been, a case of a few ‘bad apples’ within the Metropolitan police. It is rotten to the core.”\nOther forces fear the revelations about the Met will dent trust and confidence even though they are far away from London.

Everyone in every community will be asking are our police like that.”\nRishi Sunak declined in a BBC interview to say his young daughters could trust the police. “Of course we need the answer to that question to be yes,” the prime minister said. “Clearly at the moment trust in the police has been hugely damaged by the things that we’ve discovered over the past year.”\n00:02:44\nBraverman accuses Labour of 'crass political attacks' in debate over Met failings – video\nIn the Commons Braverman made clear her confidence in Rowley and said he needed time to make changes, while the Met commissioner opposed breaking up his force or changing its name. He told the BBC: “We can create chaos and an appearance of business and energy by doing some big structural thing.\n“Actually, it will just get in the way of getting under the surface and digging deep, lifting stones and dealing with what’s there and changing the culture.”\nKeir Starmer criticised the government’s “hands off approach” to delivering police reform and committed a Labour government under his leadership to introducing mandatory national rules for police forces on vetting.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about a clash between Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and Sir Mark Rowley, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.

It is a centrepiece of American democracy, playing a vital role for political representation in Washington. And its viability has never been under greater threat.\nThe Republican who dared to take on Trump – and how the party machine hit back\nRead more\nThe United States census, the measure of America’s population growth and its distribution – irrespective of immigration status – is set to take place next year under deeply contested circumstances.\nFor the first time, the census could include a question on respondents’ citizenship that, according to the bureau’s own research, will substantially reduce the number of people willing to participate. A study published last week estimated that the addition of the question could mean up to 4 million people – mostly people of color from immigrant minority communities – could go uncounted.\nIf such an undercount occurs the effects will be profound. It could allow for electorate boundaries throughout America to be redrawn, almost certainly favouring the Republican party. It could result in billions of dollars in federal funds being withheld from some of the most vulnerable communities in America.\nNow the supreme court is set to decide a case on the census, which, some say, will test the institutional biases of the highest court in the country.\n“Several key pillars of democracy are at stake in this case,” said Thomas Wolf, counsel for the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n“The census count is used to determine, among other things, how many seats in Congress each state gets and how large of a share of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding each state receives. So we’re talking not just about political representation, but in certain issues, people being able to educate their children and put food on the table.”\nThe saga involves allegations that senior administration officials have lied repeatedly, features key evidence released via a family dispute, and, last week, saw the intervention of Trump himself, who has sought to protect officials by exerting executive privilege over potentially critical documents.\nIts principal character is Trump’s commerce secretary, the 81-year-old financier Wilbur Ross, who oversees the US Census Bureau. Its bit-part players include some of America’s most infamous voter suppression architects, including the former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach and former White House strategist Steve Bannon.\nBut its origins appear to lie in a cache of documents, made public only last month, from the estate of a Republican strategist named Thomas Hofeller, known for his expertise in gerrymandering. Hofeller died in August, but left behind in his digital footprint were a series of documents revealing his work studying the political benefits to the Republican party should a citizenship question be added to the census.\nThe documents would never have seen the light of day were it not for his estranged daughter, Stephanie Hofeller, who discovered them after his death and took them to an anti-gerrymandering group in North Carolina.\nIn a piece of commissioned research focused on the state of Texas, Thomas Hofeller concluded that a count based only on citizenship, rather than the population as a whole, “would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites”.\nThe logic is simple: a citizen-only count draws political power away from Democratic-leaning Hispanic households, who would be less likely to be counted, thereby allowing for redistricting that favours Republicans.\nAccording to plaintiffs in the case before the supreme court, parts of Hofeller’s research are quoted verbatim in justice department documents later used to request the addition of the citizenship question.\nWilbur Ross, the 81-year-old commerce secretary who oversees the US Census Bureau. Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta\/AP\n“The Hofeller memo confirms what we’ve known all along but is alarming nonetheless: the census citizenship question was motivated by blatant rightwing partisanship,” said Vanita Gupta, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and former head of the justice department’s civil rights division under Obama.\n“The Trump administration has lied to Congress and the US supreme court about why it added the citizenship question,” Gupta added. “Republican political operatives plainly want to deny communities of color the healthcare, education and other services they need in order to consolidate GOP power and a whiter electorate.”\nRoss enters the picture a month after assuming his position in the Trump administration. Emails show that the commerce secretary was asked by Bannon to meet with Kobach in April 2017 to discuss the citizenship question.\nKobach had long lobbied the Trump campaign to alter the census question. The next month, Ross emailed staff in his department saying he was “mystified why nothing have [sic] been done” over adding the question. He had been cautioned by his department about the potential undercount that would result if such a question was asked.\nAccording to a timeline of events constructed by NPR, Ross pressed the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to formally request the question be added. The DoJ eventually made a formal request in December.\nThe timeline is complex, but critical to one of the central arguments before the supreme court: the charge that Ross broke the law as he lobbied for the addition. Lower courts have already found that Ross violated both the Census Act and the Administrative Procedures Act, first by lobbying the DoJ to request the change, and second by ignoring his own department’s research that showed it would lead to a significant undercount.\nDistrict judge Richard Seeborg of northern California described Ross’s behaviour as a “strong showing of bad faith” that involved a “cynical search to find some reason, any reason” to justify adding the question in his ruling against the government.\nRoss also faces allegations that he lied to Congress when he claimed the entire citizenship question was actually initiated by the DoJ (the commerce secretary has since changed his position in court filings).\nEven career bureaucrats, often averse to speaking politics, are appalled by Ross’s behaviour.\n“It’s clear to me that there is no rational justification for putting the citizenship question on the 2020 census,” said John Thompson, director of the US Census Bureau under President Obama. “There has to be some kind of political motivation behind it. There is no scientific justification.”\nSarah Sanders exits after two fraught years as Trump hails 'a very fine woman'\nRead more\nDespite the emphatic nature of the lower-court findings, onlookers remain deeply concerned that the now conservative-controlled supreme court will overturn the judgments. It is not clear the documents from Hofeller’s estate will be considered due to their late arrival in the case.\nFurther, during oral arguments in April, a number of the conservative judges seemed reticent to engage with the basic data science underpinning the case.\n“If the supreme court overturns,” Thompson said, “then what they’ve essentially done is politicise the federal statistical system for years to come. That’s because if a secretary of commerce can be arbitrary and capricious and do whatever he or she wants to do, that means that any secretary, Democrat or Republican could affect a variety of statistics; unemployment, GDP, you name it.\n“If there’s nothing that says they cannot be bound by having to perform a thoughtful process to do that, I’m afraid that they’ve opened the door to politicizing several statistical systems for years to come.”\nThe supreme court is expected to rule in late June, but its decision could come as early as this week.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about a controversy surrounding the inclusion of a citizenship question in the United States census.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\nCEO Tim Cook, who took over from late co-founder Steve Jobs last August, spearheaded the unveiling of new services -- such as in-house mapping, beefed-up Siri software, address-bar search on its Safari browser -- to help keep at bay Google and its fast-growing Android mobile platform.\nApple tweaked several features in its mobile operating system to try to enhance its ability to entice users to stay within its ecosystem. The upgrades marked a bolstering of Apple’s arsenal as it tries to keep its top-down applications and hardware environment ahead of competition from Android device makers such as Samsung Electronics and Motorola Mobility.\nBut the highlight was the debut of Apple’s in-house mapping service after years of development, a direct challenge to the same Google service that is one of the most popular functions on both Android smartphones and the iPhone.\nApple’s new mobile software -- the iOS6 -- will be available in the fall. It comes with a mapping system “built from the ground up,” said software chief Scott Forstall.\nIt will be replacing Google Maps, until now a pre-loaded app on the iPhone and iPad, with its own in-house map service, delivering a big blow to Google, which gets about half its mobile map traffic from Apple mobile devices.\nThe move signals how the friendship between the two tech giants -- former Google CEO Eric Schmidt once sat on Apple’s board -- has become a bitter rivalry shaping the evolution of the mobile industry. Late co-founder Jobs was famously quoted as saying he was willing to go “thermonuclear” on the search leader, after it decided to position Android against the iPhone.\nNow Apple will do its utmost to reduce its reliance on Google, said Colin Gillis, analyst with BGC Partners.\n“What happens if one day Google decides to not provide Apple with maps,” said Gillis. “You can’t have that kind of dependency on a competitor.”\nApple’s map service comes with three-dimensional images of cities called “Flyover” along with real-time traffic updates and also turn-by-turn navigation, the last a feature that Google has in Android devices but had not made available in Apple devices.\nAnd Siri, the innovative voice-activated iPhone search-feature users have criticized as faulty and inadequate, will now also be available on iPads and recites a larger database of answers, especially sports, restaurants and movies.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nFACTBOX: Maps, Macs and mobile dominate Apple conference\nSiri is also integrated into the new mapping service so users can ask for step-by-step directions.\nWhile Apple is late to the game with turn-by-turn directions, Forrester analyst Charles Golvin said that Apple’s new service featured various nice touches, demonstrating Apple’s ability to take an experience offered by rivals and “go even further.”\nHe also cited a new app for iPhone and iPads called Passbook that organizes a user’s electronic airline tickets, movie tickets and restaurant loyalty cards. The app is a “harbinger of them doing much, much more,” said Golvin, pointing to the electronic payment and mobile commerce market.\nFinally, executives said Apple has integrated No. 1 social network Facebook deeper into the operating system, allowing Siri-users to post photos with voice commands.\nShares in Apple ended Monday down 1.6 percent at $571.17 after climbing in early trade, repeating a typical pattern where investors buy up the stock in anticipation of news, then cash out.\nTHE EDGE\nLong lines marked the beginning of the week-long annual Worldwide Developers’ Conference, where Apple developers rub shoulders with employees, test the latest products and software, and connect with peers. Apple kicked off proceedings by touting its hardware, its biggest edge over Google.\nThe consumer device giant introduced an all-new addition to its MacBook Pro lineup, Apple’s highest-end laptops. At 0.7 inches and weighing under 4.5 pounds, the new MacBook Pro ranks among the thinnest laptops in the market and will hit store shelves months before many Microsoft Windows-equipped “Ultrabooks.” They will employ the “retina” displays that have won strong positive reviews for the new iPad, but start at $2,199.\nAlong with the introduction of the new MacBook Pro, Apple also updated it current Mac lineup including the MacBook Air.\nMarketing chief Phil Schiller outlined how the redesigned MacBook Air notebooks will be about $100 cheaper on average than predecessors, but sport quicker Intel Corp processors, potentially eating into territory staked out by Hewlett-Packard, Dell Inc and other PC makers.\nSlideshow ( 9 images )\nAnalysts have speculated that the company will begin aggressively competing on price, gradually shrinking the premium its Macs carry in general.\nMore than ever, Apple finds itself in a pitched battle with Google: in smartphones, cloud computing, and a never-ending competition to attract the best software developers. That is crucial as Apple looks to draw users deeper into its applications ecosystem.\nCook told the audience that customers have downloaded more than 30 billion Apple apps so far, choosing from more than 650,000 apps -- the largest library in the industry.\nBattling in many arenas, the rivals employ different weapons. Apple’s vise-like grip on its ecosystem - with the closely managed app store and seamless integration with hardware - stands in stark contrast to Google’s free-for-all approach.\nThe open system approach, reminiscent of Microsoft Corp’s hugely successful strategy of creating standard-setting software that runs on a variety of hardware, has allowed Android to capture the market lead in smartphones, albeit with nothing close to Apple’s profit margins.\nAndroid has also helped create several potent hardware rivals to Apple. Samsung Electronics’ Android-driven Galaxy SIII is drawing favorable comparisons to iPhone and Amazon.com Inc’s cheaper Kindle Fire is challenging Apple in tablets and digital content.\nThe move - years in the making - to replace Google Maps is a dramatic example of how the rivalry between the companies has been evolving.\nGoogle has invested huge sums in mapping technology over the years, and about half its mobile map traffic now comes from iPhones and iPads. Among other things, the traffic from those devices reveals valuable location data that helps improve the mapping service and provides features like real-time traffic reports.\nReporting by Poornima Gupta and Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the JSON-format response based on the provided news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to the topic of digital maps, but it primarily discusses Apple's announcement of its own mapping service to challenge Google Maps.

{"num":100,"Time":"July 28, 2023","Title":"Alabama's redrawn voting map could put Supreme Court to the test, again","Content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court could be facing a moment of truth as to whether it is viewed as a neutral check on political power or a partisan institution that mostly enables conservative policies.\nLast Friday, Alabama’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a new congressional district map that appears to openly defy an order issued by the Supreme Court just six weeks ago.\nThe justices on June 8 affirmed a decision by a lower court panel holding that Alabama’s previous map likely discriminated against Black voters.\nBlack voters constitute a majority in just one of Alabama’s seven congressional districts, although they account for about 27% of the state’s population, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Voting in the state has been starkly racially polarized.\nThe district court judges said in their January 2022 opinion that the \"record before us has not only once, but twice, established that the Plan substantially likely\" discriminates against Black voters.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe justices affirmed the lower court last month, ordering lawmakers to redraw the map to include either an additional majority-Black district or an additional district where Black voters have a more equitable opportunity at the ballot box.\nInstead, Alabama Republicans on July 21 passed a map that includes an additional district that doesn’t come close to a Black majority, and actually reduced the Black voting-age population in the lone existing Black-majority district.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nBlack voters now constitute a slim 50.65% majority in District 7, lowered from 55.6%; while the new District 2 is only 39.93% Black, according to the state's submissions in the suit.\nDemocrats have said a Black population around 40% could have an opportunity to elect their preferred candidates in urban counties – where white voters are more likely to support the same candidates as minority groups – but not in the rural areas that make up the 2nd District, according to a July 19 report in the Alabama Reflector, a nonprofit news organization.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe district court will consider objections from the plaintiffs, including the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, on Aug. 14. Alabama can appeal to the justices, again, if the lower court upholds its previous findings.\nRedistricting experts, civil rights advocates and legal observers seem to agree that Alabama flouted the Supreme Court’s orders. Kareem Crayton, senior director for the voting program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, told me the move seems transgressive.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\nloading\n“A generous read would be that they were mistaken or are just not good at reading the law,” but it seems more likely Republicans are “intentionally trying not to comply or simply defying” the Supreme Court, Crayton said.\nLeaders in the Alabama House and Senate didn’t respond to requests for comment. Dorman Walker, an attorney representing the redistricting committee, told me he couldn’t discuss active litigation.\nAlabama Republicans are hanging their hats, at least ostensibly, on a five-word clause and another key word in the district court’s 225-page decision that threw out the previous map: The remedial plan must include two districts where Black voters are either a majority or “something quite close to it,” that gives them an \"opportunity\" to elect candidates of their choice, the lower court said in 2022.\nLawmakers spent most of the recent redistricting sessions arguing over what the judges meant by “quite close,” and “opportunity.”\n“The question is, what is the opportunity there?” Republican Senator Steve Livingston, co-chair of the redistricting committee, said after the latest map was approved, according to the Alabama Reflector report.\nTo my mind, the concept of “opportunity” may be truly nebulous in other contexts, but the district court's meticulous opinion made clear what it meant in this case.\n“When we use the phrase ‘Black-opportunity,’ we mean a district in which a ‘meaningful number’ of non-Black voters often ‘join[] a politically cohesive Black community to elect’ the Black-preferred candidate,” the court wrote in its 2022 opinion.\nMoreover, the court's “quite close” language specifically cited sections in the plaintiffs’ submissions that elaborate on the concept of a “realistic opportunity” to elect: It cannot exist where racial polarization means Black-preferred candidates usually lose, for example.\nDemocrats and redistricting experts have said the notion that 39.3% (compared with a white population that apparently makes up 50.86% of the district) approaches a majority or delivers realistic opportunities is flabbergasting.\nCrayton said that Alabama lawmakers appear to be \"testing the Supreme Court's resolve.\"\nIndeed, Democrats have said that a second Supreme Court review is precisely the goal – and Republicans leading the effort have admitted as much.\n“The Supreme Court ruling was 5-4, so there's just one judge that needed to see something different,” Alabama House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter said after the map’s passage. Ledbetter added that a Republican U.S. Senator who called him during redistricting had expressed “surprise” that the justices ruled against Alabama in June, “given the court’s conservative tilt,” NBC News reported July 21.\nLedbetter didn’t respond to my questions.\nThat background could potentially put the Supreme Court in a position where it needs to defend its own authority, in effect.\nIt also means that a ruling for Alabama could be viewed by many as a sort of final confirmation that the court is, or has become, a partisan institution.\nThe Supreme Court's public information office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nAfter all, it was the conservative justices highly unusual intervention in the suit in February 2022 that put on hold the lower court's injunction ordering the state's Republican-led legislature to redraw the map. That original map, favoring Republicans, was used in the 2022 midterm elections.\nAnd now, Alabama is circling back with a map that arguably dilutes Black residents' voting power even worse.\nMoreover, as it stands, a majority of Americans -- 53% -- now think the justices rule mainly based on their politics, following a spate of major rulings that enabled conservative policy-making on affirmative action, LGBTQ rights and more, according to a recent poll. And the court is viewed favorably by just 44% of Americans, including just 28% of Democrats, according to a June Reuters\/Ipsos poll.\nFor the sake of its own plummeting reputation, the court simply cannot countenance Alabama Republicans’ apparent intransigence.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

{"num":106,"Time":"Mon 17 Nov 2003 10.43 CET","Title":"Inside the mind of a racist: scans may reveal brain's hidden centres of prejudice","Content":"American scientists have developed a brain scan that they say can detect people harbouring racial prejudice. While looking at a brain region known to control thoughts and behaviour, the researchers found surges of activity in racially biased white people who were shown photographs of black faces, which they say are down to suppressed prejudice.\nThe research has already provoked controversy, with some experts arguing the study's conclusions are misplaced. At its most far-reaching, the study raises the possibility that the minds of people, including police recruits, could be screened for racist attitudes. The scientist who led the research admits she was stunned by the results. \"I was shocked. I couldn't believe we got this correspondence with the brain activity,\" said Professor Jennifer Richeson, a neuroscientist at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.\nProf Richeson said the brain activity arises because the volunteers are concentrating on not doing or saying anything offensive. This inner struggle tires the brain so much, she said, that prejudiced white people who interacted with black people would find it difficult to concentrate afterwards. \"If they had an interaction that was hard to negotiate and then went back to work, they might not be able to focus on the task they're doing because they're exhausted,\" Prof Richeson said.\nTo conduct the research, her team first asked 30 white students to sit an implicit association test (IAT), in which they associated white or black names with positive or negative words. The test is contentious, but it is widely used as a convenient measure of unconscious or automatic racial bias. The students were not told what the test was about. They then briefly met a black or white person before being asked to complete a difficult mental task. Two weeks later the same students were asked to help in an unrelated experiment, in which they were handed pictures of the faces of black or white people while having their brains scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) equipment.\nDifficult\nThe scientists found a strong link between a volunteer's IAT score and activity in a region of their brain called the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Those with the highest levels of brain activity also performed the worst in the difficult mental task. \"The people are working hard to negotiate the interaction and then they're spent. It's almost like depleting a muscle: if you work it out too much then you can't lift any more weight,\" Prof Richeson said.\nOthers say it is dangerous to interpret the results that way. \"That's exactly the kind of inference we're arguing it would be unfortunate to draw at this point,\" said Professor Bill Gehring, a psychologist at the University of Michigan. \"There just isn't enough known about what this task is actually showing.\"\nThe controversial study is published today in the journal Nature Neuroscience, which also discusses it in an editorial as well as publishing an accompanying article trying to explain the context. \"This study is likely to be widely discussed, so it is important to emphasise that it is not about biological determinants of racial prejudice,\" the editorial says. \"Although it describes neural correlates of implicit bias, it says nothing about the source of this bias; even more importantly it says nothing about the relationship between implicit bias and actual behaviour towards people of other races.\"\nTrevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, welcomed the research, but said using brain scans as a test for racism would not be useful. \"We spend far too much time worried about trying to detect racism in people rather than circumscribing the behaviour which leads to bias,\" he said. \"There are people who have racist attitudes who are perfectly fair and even-handed in the ways they treat people, and there are people who would think of themselves as committed anti-racists who consistently show bias in the way they behave.\"\nProf Gehring, who helped to write the journal's accompanying article, disputes some of the study's conclusions: \"These are very important empirical findings concerning the mental processes that go on when people interact with someone of a different race, but what those findings mean is not clarified yet. You have to be very careful about how you interpret them.\" He said IAT scores are not necessarily an accurate measure of an individual's racial bias, and it is inevitable that the study volunteers would have realised what the researchers were looking for.\n\"Clearly at some point everyone realises it must be about their racial bias and they feel they're being assessed. That is an additional factor that must be taken into account.\" Others say brain activity like that seen in the study could indicate more than just racial prejudice. \"The effect the authors describe is really a subset of a much more general phenomenon, that of social distraction,\" says Professor Bob Turner, of University College London. \"Consider the difficulty of remaining focused on a serious topic of discussion when one's interlocutor is a young, curvaceous blonde with a very low-cut dress.\" He said that comparison studies are needed with less politically loaded social distractions.\nThe research marks an increasing trend in neuroscience of using brain imaging equipment to do more than merely map what part of the brain is responsible for various processes, and instead study social issues and even attempt to predict behaviour (see panel). But such work remains controversial, because it is very difficult to pin down exactly what the images reveal.\n\"You have to keep in mind just how flexible and adaptive the human brain is,\" said Prof Gehring. \"To try and take these things and say you can screen people for one thing or another and predict their behaviour is making a leap that goes way beyond where science is at right now.\"\nAnother issue is how closely what happens in a laboratory reflects real life. \"It's hard because there are so many other factors in a complex social environment,\" said Prof Richeson. \"Even if we can predict what people do in the lab, we still might not be able to predict what they do in the street or at work. You might not behave in the same way if it's your boss.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses a brain scan developed by American scientists that can detect racial prejudice in racially biased white individuals.

The research suggests that the brain activity stems from an inner struggle not to express offensive thoughts or behavior, which can lead to mental exhaustion. However, it is worth noting that the study does not establish a direct link between implicit bias detected by brain scans and actual behavior towards people of other races.

{"num":99,"Time":"Fri 7 Sep 2018 16.09 CEST","Title":"Imprisoned by algorithms: the dark side of California ending cash bail","Content":"Amber-Rose Howard nearly lost everything when she was thrown in jail as a teenager.\nThe California high schooler was a straight-A student who had offers from more than a dozen universities when she was arrested for a serious charge in 2004. After she spent two weeks behind bars, her family raised money for bail, and she slowly got her life back on track. While her case, a first-time offense, moved through the courts, she finished her classes and enrolled in college.\nUnder a new California law passed last week, however, the same arrest would have played out differently. That’s because an algorithm would have determined her fate – and probably imprisoned her indefinitely.\nCalifornia made international headlines after it became the first US state to fully eliminate cash bail, abolishing the practice that has long allowed wealthy criminal defendants to buy their freedom pre-trial while the poor languish in jail for minor charges. The legislation was celebrated by liberals for ending a cruel and unconstitutional system, but some activist groups that originally supported the bill ultimately urged governor Jerry Brown not to sign it.\nWe're all in a lot of danger\nAmber-Rose Howard\nThe law replaces the cash bail system with “risk assessment” tools in which an algorithm would weigh factors about a person to help determine whether they should be released. Critics say it gives local authorities wide discretion to decide what is considered “high risk”, makes it easy for prosecutors and judges to keep people in jail, and expands the use of technology that could intensify racial biases.\nSome fear it would enable an increase in pre-trial incarceration.\n“This will be totally devastating,” said Howard, a 32-year-old organizer who said she supported the end of the bail system, but opposed the legislation. “These risk assessment tools are likely going to classify our people as a risk … We’re all in a lot of danger.”\nThere is bipartisan agreement that cash bail is a fundamentally flawed model that has fueled mass incarceration and created two tiers of justice – forcing low-income defendants to spend months or longer behind bars without a conviction while losing their jobs, homes and families. They’re often pressured into guilty pleas.\nThere is little consensus, however, about the best replacement. The California law broadly paves the way for “preventive detention”, which critics say encourages pre-trial detention as a default in a number of scenarios and gives courts far-reaching authority to determine someone is a “public safety” threat and should be jailed.\nGovernor makes California first state to eliminate bail\nRead more\n“This makes it your burden from jail to prove that you’re entitled to freedom, a fundamental constitutional right,” said Chesa Boudin, a deputy public defender in San Francisco.\nThe assemblyman Rob Bonta, co-author of the legislation, said in an interview that critics were misinterpreting the legislation and cited estimates that 120,000 more people would be released per year under the new model: “The whole idea of this bill is to make sure people aren’t detained unnecessarily.”\nThe law also calls for an assessment algorithm to create an individual “risk score” that supposedly reveals the likelihood of re-arrest or failure to appear in court if released. Software would in effect compare the individual with people with similar profiles, which means using data from a criminal justice system that has documented discrimination at every step – including racial biases in police stops, searches and arrests.\nThe most sophisticated algorithm would still “replicate” those biases, said Natasha Minsker of the ACLU, which revoked its support of the bill. “At worst, it’s going to amplify those biases.”\nJayda Rasberry described her experience in jail: ‘I just felt like I didn’t matter, and my life was over.’ Photograph: Courtesy Jayda Rasberry\nPeople with arrest records, who may live in communities of color that are over-policed, could be deemed “high risk” and jailed as a result.\n“We are replacing money bail with an even more harmful system of profiling,” said Ivette Alé, an organizer with Californians United for a Responsible Budget (Curb), a reform group that opposed the bill.\nThere is no evidence suggesting that these kinds of algorithms have produced positive changes when implemented, said Megan T Stevenson, a George Mason University professor who studied risk assessment in Kentucky. After the state mandated use of the tools in 2011, racial disparities in pre-trial detention worsened over time – with an increase in the rate of white defendants being released, but no change for black defendants.\nCalifornia’s law also sets the stage for the detention of people who would be scored as “low risk” if they are accused of a serious crime. When Howard was arrested in high school 14 years ago, for example, she had no record, was accomplished in academics and sports, and had family support on the outside. Even if pre-trial release would provide the best outcome, the system today would probably detain her simply due to the allegations.\n“It’s a nightmare to even think about,” said Howard, who is also a Curb organizer, noting that she would have likely faced a long prison sentence if she had to fight her case while incarcerated. “It would’ve definitely destroyed my life.”\nInstead, she negotiated a deal that allowed her to stay in school and avoid prison time.\nUnder the new measure, more young defendants could have the same experience as Jayda Rasberry, another Los Angeles reform activist who also faced a serious charge at age 18 – and was detained pre-trial because she couldn’t afford bail.\n“When you’re inside of jail, it’s guilty until proven innocent,” said Rasberry, who eventually signed a plea deal and spent six years in state prison. “I just felt like I didn’t matter, and my life was over.”\nPre-trial detention sent Rasberry on a path to a prison system where inmates like her didn’t always survive, the 31-year-old said, noting she lost friends behind bars. “I’m blessed to still be here. I’m functional, but I’m not okay.”\nInstead of bail, she added, “there needs to be a system in place that helps us instead of hurts us”.\nHoward suggested the state should implement “needs assessments” instead of risk assessments, shifting the focus to rehabilitation and services.\nThe new system should also do more to give people meaningful due process when prosecutors seek to detain them, instead of giving courts “machinery to increase incarceration”, said John Raphling of the Human Rights Watch.\nSenator Bob Hertzberg, co-author of the law, said there would be reviews to ensure the algorithms weren’t biased and noted that the risk assessments were just one tool in determining detention.\nEliminating bail was the “first step” of reform, he added. “We are going to make any and all adjustments to the system to continue to make sure that it’s fair.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": {\n\"Title\": \"Imprisoned by algorithms: the dark side of California ending cash bail\",\n\"Summary\": \"The news is about California ending cash bail and replacing it with algorithm-based risk assessments.

However, after a court decision late last year, for the first time since 2012, the university’s students will be voting in a general election under the umbrella of a single district.\nThe newly minted sixth district, which includes all of A&T as well as the largely Black cities of Winston-Salem and Greensboro, is one of two North Carolina congressional seats likely to flip in favor of Democrats in the election. In the other – the state’s second district – Republican incumbent representative George Holding announced after the 2019 redistricting that he would not be seeking reelection.\nCobb, who is 19 and studying political science, cast her vote on the first day of early voting at a polling station on campus. The station itself was another fight – last fall, dozens of A&T students packed the county’s board of elections meetings to lobby for a voting site at the university, a request that was eventually granted.\nThese forms of suppression, intentional or not, made voting feel even more important, Cobb said.\n“As African Americans we pride ourselves in voting, because that’s what our ancestors fought for,” she said. “It’s something that I will never forget.”\nMore than 37,000 people aged 18-29 have already voted in the sixth district, nearly twice the tally recorded in 2016. Statewide, of the 3.3m votes cast, 12% have come from Cobb’s age group, up more than a point over 2016.\nAs African Americans we pride ourselves in voting, because that’s what our ancestors fought for\nJonezie Cobb\nRachel Weber, the North Carolina press secretary for voting advocacy group NextGen America, said she believes the uptick can be explained by young people feeling the effects of the political world on their day-to-day lives more than ever.\n“We have lived through four years of an administration that has attacked the issues near and dear to our hearts, whether it be racial justice or affordable healthcare,” Weber said. “Politics are closer to young people right now.”\nStudents at A&T rallying against racially biased districting and maps “that don’t represent us and where we live” is a prime example of the youth activism and political engagement endemic in the current election, she added.\nA&T has a long history of organizing around politics and racial justice: the Greensboro Four – the group of Black activists whose sit-ins in 1960 at a local department store helped further the civil rights movement – were all students at the university.\nBut in the past year, gerrymandering has been added to the list of seemingly evergreen conversation topics on campus that include economic inequality, criminal justice reform and systemic racism, said Derick Smith, a political science lecturer at the university.\n“[Students] became personally aware and highly agitated that they were being targeted by this particular suppression method,” Smith said. “They felt like diluting their voice and their vote was criminal.”\nThe 2016 move to split the campus came after Republican legislators were forced to remake North Carolina’s congressional maps after a US supreme court ruling deemed the previous ones unconstitutionally gerrymandered.\nAn aerial view of the part of North Carolina A&T University that was divided by the boundary line between districts six and 13. Photograph: Charles Mostoller\/Reuters\nLegislators freely admitted, however, that they would draw the new maps intending to consolidate and water down certain voting blocs, including the state’s roughly 1.5 million Black registered voters.\n“We want to make clear that we, to the extent, are going to use political data in drawing this map, it is to gain partisan advantage on the map,” the Republican legislator David Lewis said at the time. “I want that criteria to be clearly stated and understood.”\nThose maps were likely “extreme partisan gerrymanders” a panel of North Carolina judges found last year, forcing legislators again back to the drawing board. The current maps were finally approved by judges in December.\nSmith said he’s already seen impacts from the redistricting. Congressional candidates have been spotted around campus and in the community, something that rarely happened when the area was a surefire Republican stronghold.\nBut there is still work to do, he added. Following the 2020 census, the state will have to once again come up with new congressional and legislative districts. To avoid racism and partisan bias, Smith said, the state should look to models such as California and Colorado, which have shifted the responsibility for district line-drawing from politicians to citizens or independent bodies.\n“The citizens should have a greater role in drawing these maps as they affect their lives,” Smith said. “It shouldn’t be a spoils system for the party that wins an election – in a Democracy, they shouldn’t be picking their voters.”\nWithout any sort of protections in place, A&T is just one of many communities across the US that will continue to not receive fair and equal political representation, he added.\n“There’s no way the fate of Black voters should be left up to partisan design, because we’re going to lose every time,” Smith said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about the impact of Republican redistricting efforts on North Carolina A&T State University, the largest historically black university in the nation.

Joint drills with Russia – during which a flotilla sailed near Alaska this weekend – have also heightened concern over military coordination between Beijing and Moscow.\nOn Saturday, China’s coastguard directed water cannon at a Philippine coastguard resupply vessels en route to the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, which Beijing also claims. Philippine military personnel are living onboard a grounded former warship, the Sierra Madre, deliberately scuttled at the Shoal in 1999 to reinforce Manila’s claims. China’s coastguard also used water cannon against a Philippine supply crew in November 2021.\nThe Philippine coastguard has accused the Chinese crew of illegal conduct and dangerous manoeuvres, and its government has summoned the Chinese ambassador to lodge a diplomatic protest. Its foreign ministry said it was unable to reach Beijing counterparts during the incident.\nThe US, EU, France, Japan and Australia were among nations to voice support for the Philippines and concern over China’s actions. Washington also reaffirmed its commitment to obligations under a mutual defence treaty, to defend the Philippines if its public vessels and forces come under armed attack.\nBlake Herzinger, a research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre, said there was “significant escalatory potential” in the Philippine holdings of the South China Sea. “Beijing’s risky behaviour in the region has the potential to draw the two powers into conflict even without intending to do so,” Herzinger said.\nWhat activity would trigger the treaty, and how close the weekend’s incident came, remains unclear, said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in east Asia at King’s College London. Both sides have released footage of the confrontation. The Philippine coastguard spokesperson, Jay Taryela, also released photos purporting to show boats from China’s maritime militia assisting the interception of the Philippines supply mission.\nBut Patalano said the US was sending Beijing a message that it considered activity in disputed areas such as the Shoal as covered by the treaty.\n“If these things continue to escalate there will be a serious conversation with the US and Philippines on how to cooperate so the Philippines remain firmly in control of the situation as much as possible.”\nBeijing says its coastguard was “professional and restrained” in having “lawfully stopped” two Philippine vessels which it accused of violating Chinese sovereignty.\nUnder the administration of its president, Bongbong Marcos, who succeeded Rodrigo Duterte in June 2022, the Philippines has strengthened its ties and increased cooperation with the US, particularly in pushing back on China’s territorial claims.\nAmanda Hsiao, senior China analyst with the Crisis Group, said Beijing had traditionally sought to draw a line between Philippine transportations of humanitarian supplies and of construction equipment to the Shoal. Statements suggested it was blaming this incident on the Philippines for transporting the latter.\n“This is unlikely to be the primary motivation,” she said on Twitter. “The use of a more forceful (though not new) tactic is likely more tied to Beijing’s concerns with the Marcos administration’s US tilt and more forward-leaning South China Sea policy than the specifics of the resupply.”\nChina’s claim of sovereignty over about 90% of the South China Sea was found by the Hague in 2016 to have no legal basis, but Beijing continues to ignore that ruling and has boosted its presence in the region, in particular through its coastguard.\n“China has created a coastguard with a mission to expand Chinese control in the South China Sea. This is all based on a warped historical narrative that bears little relation to the evidence,” said Bill Hayton, the author of The South China Sea: The Struggle for Power in Asia.\nCombined with the growing cooperation between Washington and Manila in pushing back on China, “this is setting up a cycle of action and reaction that is becoming more dangerous”, said Hayton.\nReactions were still escalating on Tuesday. China’s foreign ministry repeated calls for the Philippines to immediately remove the Sierra Madre from the Shoal and “restore it to its unoccupied state”.\nIn reply, a senior Philippine national security council official said they would never abandon their post, and would do “whatever is necessary” to resupply it.\nAt the same time China’s coastguard was challenging Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, its navy was conducting joint drills with Russia off the coast of Alaska. The exercise raised some concern about the growing cooperation between Beijing and Moscow, whose leaders declared a “limitless” partnership in 2021, but did not draw the same opprobrious reaction from the US as the Philippine incident.\nAvailable information suggests the 11 Chinese and Russian warships were in the US’s exclusive economic zone, where the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) says foreign military activity is legal as long as it doesn’t intrude into territorial waters.\nThe US deployed four US Navy destroyers to the area, but government and military statements did not suggest the presence was a threat. Alaska senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, however, described the activity as an “incursion” and called for increased military funding for their region.\n“Reacting by calling this a threat, or an incursion, is playing into Beijing’s hands in particular, as it commonly labels legal US maritime activity in the same way when objecting to it,” said Herzinger, from the Sydney-based United States Studies Centre.\nThe US government frequently conducts freedom of navigation exercises, including in places like the Taiwan strait and South China Sea, to reassert the rights under Unclos.\nHowever, Herzinger added: “The US has long been the only power capable of projecting significant combat power far from its shores without much fear of similar operations being conducted near its own homeland – these kinds of operations are intended to shake the foundation of that long-held assumption of relative insulation.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"There is a territorial dispute between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, which is at a high risk of escalating into a conflict involving the two superpowers.

Rifugio Torino, popular with skiers and hikers, is reachable from Courmayeur by the Skyway, a cable car completed in 2015 that links the Italian town with Pointe Helbronner, a 3,462-metre mountain on the frontier between the two countries.\nDi Maio was pushed to intervene after a deputy with the small far-right party Brothers of Italy raised questions in parliament over concerns that the French were trying to monopolise the holiday destination.\nMont Blanc melting glacier yields Indian newspapers from 1966 plane crash\nRead more\nThe French measures include a ban on any kind of vehicle and on taking pets to the area.

In 2015, the mayor of Chamonix, Eric Fournier, ordered Alpine guides to close off access to the Gigante glacier on the Italian side.

The party’s leader, Giorgia Meloni, wrote on Twitter: “Brothers of Italy denounced the unacceptable French invasion of Mont Blanc. France continues to violate our borders. We cannot tolerate yet another attack on Italy.”\nMatteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, also waded into the debate, saying: “We just need national borders to be respected on Mont Blanc.”\nDi Maio caused a diplomatic row with France in early 2019 after travelling to Paris to meet leaders of the “yellow vest’ movement.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"Italy has reignited a dispute with France over Mont Blanc border rights.

{"num":6,"Time":"SEPTEMBER 21, 2017","Title":"Iraqis track abandoned homes with digital tools","Content":"By Chris Arsenault, Thomson Reuters Foundation\nTORONTO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In camps across northern Iraq, people forced from their homes by Islamic State militants are using their phones to track what is happening to their properties, according to researchers who say returning home is crucial for building a safe future in the war-torn nation.\nMore than three million Iraqis have been driven from their homes, land and farms, according to the United Nations, many of them by armed groups like Islamic State (IS).\nAs pro-government forces intensify the fight against IS, clearing militants from much of Mosul and other cities they once held, displaced people are hoping to return home soon.\nBefore leaving the camps, they are keeping a close eye on Facebook and digital messaging services to better understand what they will be returning to or who might be occupying their homes, said Nadia Siddiqui from Social Inquiry, a research group based in northern Iraq.\nWith conflicting land claims and weak property rights in parts of Iraq due to years of violence, establishing who rightfully owns what is crucial for reducing violence and building social trust, Siddiqui said.\nDigital tools are helping establish ownership by allowing them to build dossiers of what belongs to them with photographic evidence, title deeds and other data which could be used in court to prove their claims.\n“In the long-term, land and property issues are some of the root causes (of strife),” Siddiqui told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Erbil, Iraq.\nDisputes over property exacerbate communal or religious tensions, she said, and lingering issues over unclear ownership can fester for generations, making it difficult to build the economy and move past a history of violence.\n“People remember these kinds of things,” Siddiqui said of land disputes.\nClearing up ownership conflicts and creating arbitration processes for competing land claims can help ease social tensions, she said.\nEVIDENCE\nMore than 60 percent of displaced people use digital tools like Facebook, camera phones and messaging apps to actively monitor the status of their properties, according to a July survey in Erbil supported by Social Inquiry.\nThe average household of displaced people has three mobile phones, the small survey said, meaning tools to collect data on properties are accessible even to those who fled their lands in the dead of night.\nThirty two percent of displaced people surveyed share information about the status of their properties on social media.\n“What is so exciting about the process is that people have this evidence already on their phones or on their Facebook page,” said Emily Frank, an anthropologist turned marketing executive in Montreal, Canada, who has monitored property rights in countries facing conflict.\nMany people, however, do not realize these digital documents and photos of the land where they once lived can be used as evidence in court or a property restitution process once it is safe enough to return home, said Frank.\nAlong with helping individuals claim their homes from armed groups or others who have been occupying them, photos, videos and other digital data become increasingly powerful as more displaced people collect them, she said.\n“If more people can submit evidence, it becomes more widely corroborated,” Frank told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It will be a more just and transparent process.”\nDOMINO EFFECT\nJon Unruh, a professor at McGill University in Montreal who studies land rights, has watched the process happen in Iraq first hand.\nUnruh interviewed a 76-year-old man in Erbil who, after fleeing an IS-controlled area, asked a relative still living near his home to walk around the property and take pictures to see who was living inside.\nIS and its supporters had occupied homes in the area, and the militant group even issued its own property title deeds, so the displaced man used digital tools and family networks to try and gather information about his home to claim it upon return.\nThis kind of data could be presented before a government arbitration panel or via a transitional justice plan from the U.N. or a similar international agency when the man attempts to reclaim his property, Unruh said.\nIraqi government officials working on property restitution could not be reached for comment.\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Iraq, a U.N.-linked body working with the government on property restitution for refugees, was unavailable for comment.\nOfficials in Kurdistan, the northern semi-autonomous region of Iraq of which Erbil is the capital, are planning a referendum vote on independence for Sept. 25.\nThe move, opposed by Iraq’s central government, could complicate efforts for displaced people living in the region to claim properties in other parts of Iraq once it is safe enough to leave camps in the Kurdish region.\nIt is unclear what moves Iraq’s government will make on property rights in areas once controlled by IS based on digital data, Unruh said.\nBut officials in the capital Baghdad who he met recently understand the importance of property rights in reducing violence.\n“The Iraqi government is most concerned people returning home to ISIS-held areas are going to default to armed kin to resolve their property disputes,” Unruh told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“That returnee who finds their property destroyed moves into someone else’s house. When that person returns there is a conflict… It creates a domino effect.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses the use of digital tools by displaced Iraqis to track the status of their properties, which is crucial for them as they hope to return home after being forced out by groups like Islamic State (IS).

Individual plot numbers will also be linked to bank records and the national ID Aadhaar numbers, they said.\nOfficials have billed the programme as a way to tackle corruption and land disputes, but critics warned of many potential pitfalls - from outdated land registry records to flaws in the Aadhaar database.\nLinking land records to Aadhaar requires “extreme caution”, said Kanchi Kohli, a senior researcher at the Centre for Policy and Research think-tank, citing frequent cases of mismatched IDs, or a lack of registration in the system.\n“It may further complicate existing tensions in creating and maintaining land records, and gets particularly exclusionary when land is being used seasonally by pastoral communities or common use for forest produce or fishing,” she added.\nThe land ID scheme is part of a push to digitalise India’s land records that began in 2008 and was scheduled to be completed by the end of March this year. It will now be extended to 2024, authorities said.\nLand department officials told lawmakers digitalising land records was “a game changer in reducing corruption” as well as land disputes, saying it empowered ordinary people by allowing them to access information online.\nAbout 70% of land in developing nations is undocumented, leaving more than a quarter of the world’s population vulnerable to disputes, evictions and encroachment, according to the Washington-based land rights nonprofit Cadasta Foundation.\nWhile documenting land data can lead to greater efficiency in land administration and increased prosperity, authorities may not be consulting communities, failing to secure data, or using it to evict vulnerable people, human rights groups say.\nSome Indian states have not surveyed their land in more than a century, and experts have questioned the logic of digitalising existing records, and raised concerns over data access and privacy as records are made accessible online.\nPranab Choudhury, convener at the Center for Land Governance think-tank, said the digital ID scheme was potentially beneficial but could become ineffective “and even highly contested” if it was based on outdated records.\n“Many plots have been subdivided since the last survey, yet remain as one plot in cadastral maps. Subdivisions are often not recorded to avoid transaction cost, so ULPIN should be implemented only after a complete resurvey,” he said.\nIn addition, women, Dalits and indigenous people who are often prevented from owning land risk being shut out, he added.\n\"Implementing ULPIN hurriedly, without addressing legacy issues can seriously undermine citizen trust and may lead to more disputes. The poor and other disadvantaged groups may be further alienated and excluded,\" he added. (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Helen Popper.

{"num":2,"Time":"FEBRUARY 16, 2018","Title":"African startups bet on blockchain to tackle land fraud","Content":"By Kevin Mwanza, Henry Wilkins, Thomson Reuters Foundation\nNAIROBI\/ACCRA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On a recent Saturday afternoon, Joseph Njuguna received a worrying call. Without his permission, someone was excavating a small piece of land he had bought six years ago.\nWhen he reached the site he found an excavator digging up soil, and two yellow Tata trucks waiting to ferry it away.\nNjuguna stopped them, but that did not prevent the “new landowner” from claiming he had legal title to the plot in Utawala, about 26 km (16 miles) east of Kenya’s capital Nairobi.\n“I asked for the title and he couldn’t produce it. But he still claimed the plot was his,” Njuguna told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nCases of double ownership of land are common in Kenya, where cartels collude with officials to create parallel titles for parcels of land they want to acquire illegally, experts said.\nBut that could change if a new crop of African startups succeeds in using blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, to create foolproof digital land registries.\nGovernments and businesses around the world are exploring ways to store data, such as contracts and assets, in blockchains - which are ledgers of digital transactions - amid rapidly growing investor interest.\nCountries including Honduras, Georgia and Rwanda have signed deals to build blockchain-based land-titling systems, where information is stored in immutable digital registries and cross-checked by a network of computer users.\nBROADER UPTAKE\nLand records in most African countries date back to colonial times, and the ownership of most holdings is unclear especially where it has been held communally, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization said.\nResolving disputes is often a lengthy process, with Kenya’s under-staffed 27 land and environment courts relying on incomplete paperwork from registries, lawyers said.\nBlockchain would help by making all land records publicly available online and eliminating multiple titles for the same piece of land, said Peter Tole, head of Land Layby Group, a Nairobi-based real estate firm.\nThe company plans to launch a private land registry in Kenya this month to help clients, mostly diaspora investors, buy property safely.\nThe registry will be powered by a cryptocurrency-like unit called a ‘harambee token’. It rewards users for adding correct entries to the blockchain and penalizes them for erroneous ones.\nUnder the system, the first person to register a piece of land correctly is rewarded with 100 harambee tokens, the second person gets 80 tokens, the third 50, and the fourth earns 35.\nA wrong entry means they lose those tokens, which at present only have nominal value.\n“With blockchain you don’t really need to trust the other party,” Tole said, adding he hopes to expand to Tanzania, Ethiopia, Ghana and Papua New Guinea later this year.\n“The system itself is trust.”\nAlthough Kenya’s lands ministry has sole responsibility for issuing titles, Tole said the new registry would complement state records, making them easier to verify and more reliable.\n“I see most African governments adopting this (blockchain) technology that will revolutionize land registries,” Tole said.\nHowever, it is not clear that governments will permit the technology. Tole said the key challenge facing Land Layby Group and others was getting support from governments and state agencies to make blockchain-based registries available to all.\nKenya’s central bank, for instance, has repeatedly said it did not support any form of cryptocurrency use in the country.\n“We expect some friction with the authorities because they may not really accept the functionalities of the harambee token,” Tole said.\nBRIBES\nAnti-graft watchdog Transparency International has long ranked the land ministry as one of Kenya’s most corrupt institutions, where people have to pay bribes for services.\nCorrupt cartels often make entire files disappear so that they can illegally acquire and transfer lucrative plots, from public forests to school playgrounds, campaigners say.\nThe lands ministry is digitizing its 57 paper-based land registries but progress is slow with only a third of registries digitized by November, according to local media.\nAround two-thirds of Kenya’s land is customarily owned by communities without formal title deeds, making it easy for corrupt individuals to sell or lease the land without the communities’ knowledge.\n“If blockchain can help secure their farming livelihoods, then it’s welcomed,” said Clement Lenachuru, a commissioner at Kenya’s National Land Commission, an independent government body set up in 2012 to manage public land.\nMAPPING A NATION\nIn Ghana, more than 80 percent of landowners lack title 60 years after independence, according to its land commission. Most land is held customarily with oral agreements between subsistence farmers and land-owning chiefs.\nGhanaian startup Bitland is using the distributed digital ledger to boost the integrity of land records.\n“We’re looking to map the whole of Ghana,” said Narigamba Mwinsuubo, Bitland’s founder.\nThree-year old Bitland, which plans to enter Nigeria and Kenya this year, has been helping farmers register their previously customary land online.\nAs customary land rights are agreed verbally, Bitland’s surveyors interview farmers, their neighbors and chiefs to agree on each parcel’s boundaries.\n“Once we’re able to register these ... banks will grant loans and mortgages to families,” Mwinsuubo said.\nBack in Kenya, Njuguna said he was forced to rely on a lower-technology solution. The day after he saw off the excavator, he fenced off his 0.25 acre (0.1 hectare) plot and placed a sign warning that “Trespassers will be prosecuted”.\n“I was shocked that someone decided to construct on my land without permission,” the 56-year-old said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about the use of blockchain technology to tackle land fraud in Africa.

Otherwise these systems can further marginalise and disenfranchise people without digital access,” she said.\nAbout 70% of land in the developing world is undocumented, leaving more than a quarter of the world’s population vulnerable to conflict, evictions and encroachment, Cadasta estimates.\nWith digitization comes an increased burden on such people to prove their ownership and safeguard their land, said Usha Ramanathan, an independent legal researcher who has studied India’s digital identification system.\n“For the government, digitisation makes it easier to administer and go to market. But what is the use of an open registry for poor communities and small and marginalised farmers who cannot access it?” she said.\nIndia also does not yet have a personal data protection law, and it is unclear who will control the data and who has access to it, she said.\n“Bringing in technology does not change the equation on the ground - people still have very differential access to technology,” she said.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.

But a protracted refusal by the province and the federal government to make good on the agreement forced the nations to spend more than two decades battling for compensation.\n“Honouring Treaty 8 is a key part of our work to advance reconciliation … and reconnect these five Nations with their land,” said the British Columbia premier, David Eby, at the news conference. “By settling these treaty land entitlement specific claims, we’re restoring the rightful amount of land that was promised under the treaty and all the benefits that should have flowed at the time to those Nations.”\nEby said the settlement with Treaty 8 nations marks a “huge milestone” on the “long road to reconciliation” and prevents further protracted and costly court battles.\nLandmark deals give Indigenous key role in Canada resource projects\nRead more\nIn 2021, the British Columbia supreme court sided with Blueberry River after a multi-year legal fight, finding the province had violated the nation’s treaty rights by allowing fossil-fuel development in the region, which had prevented the nation from being able to live off the land.\nThat court decision culminated in a January agreement with the province that would see new protections for wildlife, a halt to logging in old-growth forests, new compensation for the community and limits on how much land resource companies can disturb. The provincial government has also agreed to establish a C$200m restoration fund to support “healing” of the land from years of industrial disturbance.\n“It’s been a long road for my people,” Chief Judy Desjarlais of the Blueberry River said on Saturday, as her community celebrated their latest win to reclaim the lands and compensation owed to them.\nThe province said it will transfer 109,385 acres of crown land under the settlement to the 3,300 people living within the five First Nations.\nAs part of the initial treaty, Indigenous nations were promised 160 acres of land per person to allow for traditional harvesting and to benefit from economic opportunities.\nOntario says ‘colonization’ costs mean it does not owe First Nations billions\nRead more\nThe Saulteau First Nations chief councillor, Justin Napoleon, said that never happened. Instead, the provincial government allowed settlers on their lands over the years without consultation, prompting the nation’s Elders to decide to fight back, he said.\n“It’s because of this unjustness that our elders set out to correct this wrongdoing,” he said. “They approached the government expecting that they would honour their word, but doors were shut in their face.”\nThe federal government said it would contribute C$800m to the nations as compensation.\n“It’s not a windfall, it’s not free money,” said the federal Indigenous services minister, Marc Miller, adding that by not upholding its obligations as a treaty partner, the government had “broken” its promises.\n“It’s a bill that’s not been paid for 100 years.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"Canada has agreed to pay C$800m (US$600m) to settle a land claims dispute with five First Nations.

Now, however, the so-called “whisky war”, which was never really a conflict at all, has finally been resolved with the formal division of a tiny barren Arctic island between Canada and Denmark.\nSitting in the Kennedy Channel of Nares Strait between the north-western coast of the semi-autonomous Danish territory of Greenland and Canada’s Ellesmere Island, the uninhabited half-mile-square Hans Island has no mineral resources nor much else of interest unless you are a visiting seabird.\nShaped like a muffin and surrounded by cliffs, it was for centuries an Inuit hunting ground. Crucially, however, it has been at the centre of a long-running border dispute between Canada and Denmark – via Greenland’s home rule government – with Copenhagen claiming that geological evidence points to Hans Island being part of Greenland – a claim rejected by Ottawa.\nAerial view of Hans Island. Photograph: Gallo Images\/Getty Images\nCanada and Denmark agreed in 1973 to create a border through Nares Strait, halfway between Greenland and Canada. But they were unable to agree which country would have sovereignty over Hans Island, which lies about 680 miles (1,100km) south of the north pole. In the end they decided to work out the question of ownership later.\nThat prompted largely good-natured advocacy between the two parties, including adverts posted on Google promoting their claims, and flag-raising stunts.\nThe “whisky war” reference came about after Denmark’s minister of Greenland affairs raised a Danish flag on the island in 1984, buried a bottle of Danish schnapps at the base of the flagpole and left a note saying: “Welcome to the Danish island.”\nCanadians planted their own flag and left a bottle of Canadian whisky. Since then, the countries have in turns hoisted their flags and left bottles of various spirits in tit-for-tat moves.\nIn 2002, Nana Flensburg was part of a Danish military crew that stood on the cliff to perform a flag-raising ceremony. The Politiken newspaper on Tuesday quoted her as saying in her diary that “among the stones in the cairns were lots of bottles, glasses, etc with documents that informed about previous visits to the island”.\nAt the height of the rivalry, both sides took to buying ads on Google to make their claim after Denmark said it would send a letter of protest over a visit in 2005 by Canada’s then defence minister, Bill Graham.\nGraham stated Canada had always owned the island, prompting Denmark to respond: “Hans Island is our island.” Some Canadians in turn proposed a boycott of Danish pastries, in an echo of the way some Americans rejected “french fries” when France declined to join coalition forces in Iraq.\nNow the friction is being brought to an end with the two countries agreeing to divide the tiny island between them under an agreement to be signed later on Tuesday.\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n“It sends a clear signal that it is possible to resolve border disputes … in a pragmatic and peaceful way, where the all parties become winners,” said the Danish foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod.

Photograph: Godfreeman Kaptigau\nBut the Garara people who now live along the coastline have also laid claim to the island.\n“If you look at old maps, the land didn’t exist back then,” says deputy provincial administrator Joe Mokada. “And so, when warring tribes fought over land, this land wasn’t there to be fought over.\n“But, in recent years, the island was formed, vegetation started growing there and people feel entitled to the land but we have to determine who, if anyone, it belongs to. It’s a strange phenomenon, in which, while other parts of the Pacific, they are losing land to rising sea waters – we are instead gaining land.”\n‘Our generation will feel the full brunt of climate change’\nThe formation of the island is yet to be studied. Locals say that the government and environmental experts have not visited the area to investigate.\nHowever, the community believes the island formed as wind and waves repeatedly deposited sediment – potentially pollution from a local palm oil factory – parallel to the shoreline, similar to the formation of a barrier island.\nA fisherman holds the black sand for which Kikiri beach is famous. Photograph: Godfreeman Kaptigau\n“Since the late 80s, when the oil palm factory commenced production, we have seen pollution in our ocean that came down from the Bangoho River [mouth]. We noticed the coral started dying and the fish population decreased,” says Seboda.\n“We especially noticed a drastic change after Cyclone Guba devastated [the province of] Oro in 2007. Coastal villages from Binjefada to Garara [along the Gona coast] were destroyed. But while these villages were destroyed, this island started forming.”\nSchneider Yasi, a private geologist for Kingston Resources who has reviewed maps of the area, thinks the island is likely to have been formed by sediment deposits.\n“It may have been a reef system that was eventually engulfed by the delta’s continuous sedimentation,” he said.\nThe dispute over the new island has also disrupted plans by local marine association Kikiri Local Marine Management Area (KLMMA), formed by youth from the area, to protect and sustainably manage marine resources in the area.\nThe association began planting mangroves around the island to protect the surrounding wetlands and ecosystems, with future plans to turn the island into an ecotourism attraction. However, their plans were abruptly halted by local village elders.\nElijah Yapuri, coordinator of the Kikiri Local Marine Management Area, says older generations should stop fighting over whom the land belongs to. Photograph: Godfreeman Kaptigau\n“The older generation won’t be around to feel the worsening effects of climate change, yet they are the ones putting a halt to our plans, just to argue over whose land it is,” says Elijah Yapuri from Banumo village and a member of the association.\n“Our generation will feel the full brunt of climate change and are already seeing it with our corals dying, villages going under and so we are pushing to continue efforts to protect these resources for future. But they don’t see it that way.”\n‘Nowhere else to go’\nThe effects of the climate crisis are evident in Oro province and have intensified the dispute over this new land, as villages are destroyed by cyclones, or submerged by king tides, and food sources, like fish, become more scarce.\nLocal fishermen say they have to go some miles out into the ocean to fish because the water around the coast is too warm for fish and other sea creatures.\n“Years ago, fish was abundant in this area,” Seboda says. “We used to simply throw our nets out and fetch tons of fish, and a variety of them too.\nA fisherman stands upon the stump of a coconut tree ravaged by rising tides. Fish are not as abundant in the coast’s waters as in the past. Photograph: Godfreeman Kaptigau\n“But now the water is too hot for them and the coral reefs near land have died so they have migrated further out into the ocean, away from the land, so we have to travel further out there on our canoes to fish. I worry that one day we won’t have any fish in the ocean.”\nThe villages that lined the once thriving coastline are now few and far between. A few tall, sturdy coconut trees are all that is left of the villages destroyed when Cyclone Guba hit in 2007. Oro was particularly badly affected and 149 people were killed.\nWaususu, once a populous village, is now regularly inundated with water. Places where houses used to stand are now covered in mangroves and swamp.\n“We are standing where the centre of the village used to be,” Seboda says, as he stands knee-deep in a lagoon. “Because of the cyclone and the sea levels rising, the people had to flee inland and settle where they could, because all land here is customary land.”\nAt high tide the water comes all the way in to this village, which is why homes are built on stilts. Photograph: Godfreeman Kaptigau\n“When it’s high tide, the water comes all the way in, and we walk around with the water all the way to our ankles, that’s why our houses are built high above on long, wooden stilts,” one villager, Mary, says.\n“There is no beach when the tide is high. The water rises over the beach which forces people passing by to come through our village to avoid the water.\n“We are used to it now.

Both countries claimed a 175,000 sq km (67,567 sq mile) zone, about half the size of Germany, situated north of Russia's Kola Peninsula and the Norwegian coast. The treaty divides the disputed area equally between the two countries.\nThe dispute flared up in the 1970s and was initially about fish. But the area is now thought to be not only rich in fishing but also in oil and gas, with proven petroleum reserves on both the Russia and Norwegian sides.\nRussia's president, Dmitry Medvedev, and Norway's prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, signed the treaty today in the Russian city of Murmansk, north of the Arctic circle and not far from the Norwegian border.\nWith the five Arctic powers - Russia, the US, Canada, Denmark and Norway - scrambling to file territorial claims over the Arctic, Medvedev hailed the agreement as a \"constructive\" model of how rival Arctic nations should settle their differences. He also warned Nato not to \"exacerbate\" its presence in the region.\n\"This is a practical illustration of the principle that all disputes in the Arctic must be tackled by the Arctic nations themselves by way of talks and on the basis of international law,\" a Kremlin source told the Russian news agency Interfax.\nUnder existing rules states have exclusive economic rights up to 200 miles from their shores. But they can claim even more if they can demonstrate that their continental shelf extends beyond this limit. In 2007 Russia planted a flag at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean in support of its claim that it was entitled to a much bigger chunk of the Arctic.\nThe gesture triggered a series of furious counter-claims by Canada and Denmark that their territory is continuous with the Lomonosov ridge, an underwater ridge in the Arctic Ocean. The competition is driven by estimates that the Arctic could hold 13% of the world's remaining oil deposits and 30% of its gas reserves, not to mention precious metals.\nToday one Arctic expert said climate change would make the extraction of oil and gas from the Arctic much easier. \"In the future it will be more acceptable. It [extraction] isn't so difficult,\" Professor Anatoly Kolodkin, the president of the International Maritime Law Association told the Guardian.\nKolodkin denied accusations that Russia was trying to \"grab\" Arctic territory and said the Kremlin was a signatory to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which decides all Arctic claims. \"As Mr [Vladimir] Putin emphasised we are not going to take something unilaterally. We will only act in accordance with international procedures,\" he said.\nTwo years ago Russia's security council identified the Arctic as an important \"strategic resource\" to be exploited – but also said its ecological system should be preserved.

{"num":13,"Time":"Mon 25 Sep 2023 08.00 CEST","Title":"‘We defended our right to the land’: Brazil’s Indigenous people hail supreme court victory","Content":"“W\ne are not defenders of nature; we are nature defending itself.” These words from Yoko Kopacã, the 72-year-old leader of the Indigenous communities settling the Ibirama-Laklãnõ region in Santa Catarina, in southern Brazil, sum up the longstanding hope for justice in their struggle for land. For more than 100 years, the Xokleng people have waited for the Brazilian state to recognise their rights.\nOn 21 September they prevailed – and their victory in the federal supreme court will reshape the way the state approaches Indigenous land rights in Brazil.\nYoko Kopacã, one of the leading figures in the struggle of the Xokleng people to reclaim their land\nUntil the court’s decision, by nine justices out of 11, Indigenous people had to prove they occupied or contested the territory they claimed before 5 October 1988, the day Brazil’s federal constitution came into force. This was seen as unfair by campaigners, as many Indigenous people are nomadic or had been forcibly removed by miners or farmers, and disputes tended to be settled in favour of the landowners. However, the supreme court rejected the notion of a “time limit” on Indigenous people’s claims to ancestral land, and said the essential element must be how Indigenous people occupy and derive their livelihood from the land.\nThe legal argument of the “marco temporal”, or time limit, was first used in 2009 in a case related to the Raposa Serra do Sol reserve in the Amazon, and was an attempt by agribusiness lobbyists to curb the boundary of Indigenous lands, despite opposition from environmentalists.\nIn the same year, the Santa Catarina state government, through its Environmental Institute, evicted the Xokleng people, claiming they were illegally occupying two conservation areas, the Serra da Abelha and the Sassafrás biological reserve. The Xokleng appealed against the decision, and that’s when they came up against the time limit argument, which the state of Santa Catarina used to justify the eviction.\nNduzi Gakran looks out over the Hercílio River, which flows into the Itajaí-Açu in the municipality of Ibirama\nThe case eventually reached the supreme court, whose recent verdict dismissed the time limit thesis, ending years of legal wrangling and giving the Xokleng a pivotal victory against the local state government. The case is important because in 2019, the supreme court decided that its decision would set a precendent, so the Ibirama-Laklãnõ verdict will have widespread implications for all land boundary disputes in Brazil, and Indigenous communities throughout the country are celebrating the ruling.\nYet this decision will hardly eliminate the tensions surrounding Brazil’s land conflicts, which have doggedly persisted despite rulings in the capital, Brasília. Even if they have prevailed in the supreme court, the Xokleng leaders that the Guardian met remain anxious about attacks by non-Indigenous tenants. Farmers also express worries over potential conflicts.\nFrictions emerge when Indigenous ranchers and farmers live in the same region. The Ibirama-Laklãnõ land encompasses Alto Vale do Itajaí region, including Doutor Pedrinho, Itaiópolis, José Boiteux and Vitor Meireles municipalities. It is home to about 2,000 Indigenous people, primarily Xokleng but also Guarani and Kaingang.\nA deforested area within the Ibirama-Laklãnõ Indigenous land. Loggers clear the ground to plant pine and eucalyptus trees\nThe conflict over the Xokleng land has endured for more than a century. The contested 37,000 hectares (91,500 acres) had been first established in 1914 by the then Indian Protection Service (SPI), which later became Funai, the National Indigenous People Foundation. However, the Santa Catarina authorities did not respect the agreement and a substantial portion of the land was taken without Indigenous consent.\nThe Xokleng retreated to an area of about 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres). But a Funai study, including historical, anthropological, cartographic and environmental elements, has concluded that the traditional land use stands at nearly three times the current occupied area, more akin to the original 37,000 hectares. Funai used the study to support the Xokleng in their legal appeal.\nAccording to Nduzi Gakran, a Xokleng president of Brazil’s first Indigenous environmental NGO, the dwellings occupy the 14,000-hectare segment: the surrounding area supports the community’s subsistence through traditional gathering, hunting and fishing.\nThe pinhão, or pine nut of the araucaria tree, is collected for food or to be replanted. Seedlings will be planted out in the forest and Nduzi Gakran checks the progress of one he put in the ground earlier\nNduzi Gakran and other Xokleng people patrol the forest of the Ibirama-Laklãnõ Indigenous lands\nAt the boundary of the 37,000-hectare area, marked by the remains of an imbuia tree, Xokleng people would previously set up a temporary camp for the pinhão harvest – the fruit of the araucaria trees that grow extensively in the region. Gakran says: “They put pressure on us in our region to intimidate our leaders and criminalise us … We have protected nature for millennia.\nI’m in this fight for the memory of my parents and grandparents who were killed in Santa Catarina\nYoko Kopacã, community elder\n“I’m astonished because the Environmental Institute sued Xokleng. We defended our right, which is simply the right to the land. The map established the 37,000-hectare area; it just needed to be respected. Yet nobody respected it,” he adds.\nIn response to the state government’s claim to the territory, members of the community such as elder Yoko Kopacã and her family set up camp at the site to symbolise resistance and the fight for their land. Kopacã says: “I honour my ancestors; that’s why I’m in this fight, for the memory of my parents and grandparents who were killed and suffered from the Indigenous genocide in Santa Catarina.”\nYoko Kopacã: ‘I honour my ancestors; that’s why I’m in this fight’\nVomble Camelem, chief of the nine remaining Indigenous villages in the territory, believes their ancestors, many of whom were victims of indiscriminate killings, spiritually sustain their struggle. He says their people might not endure today without reverence for those who have gone before.\n“We had this land where Indigenous people roamed; I hunted a lot with my father in these areas. Even with the 37,000 hectares, we will have limits, whereas Indigenous people of that time had none. The time limit should not be applied to us but to non-Indigenous people who invaded Brazil,” Camelem says.\nLong history of persecution\nThe enduring conflict against white settlers in the region is rooted in the history of violence and land disputes over generations. Research by anthropologist Sílvio Coelho dos Santos in his book Os Índios Xokleng, Memória Visual, reveals that an encounter between the Xokleng and white settlers in 1914 led to the establishment of a sort of “meeting point” by the Indian Protection Service.\nThe initiative aimed to establish peaceful relations, as the Xokleng had suffered at the hands of “bugreiros”, white mercenaries who hunted Indigenous people – “bugres”, meaning savages – so their land could be claimed by settlers.\nPictures and artefacts in the Xokleng cultural space, in Aldeia Bugio, on the Ibirama-Laklãnõ Indigenous land\nIn evidence gathered during the 1970s, a bugreiro told Dos Santos that they used to cut off the ears of Indigenous people as proof of their kills to the colonisers.\nEunice Kerexu, secretary of Indigenous environmental and territorial rights at the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, said before the supreme court’s verdict: “The Xokleng people currently face the grim prospect of extinction due to the relentless extermination attempts that have unfolded over history. The notoriety of the ‘bugreiros’ is a regrettable but undeniable reality in Santa Catarina. These Indigenous-people hunters were paid based on the number of ears they delivered to their masters.”\nGapé Gakran, in a traditional headdress, with her daughter Zágtxo, 14 months, at the Traíra waterfall, in the Ibirama-Laklãnõ Indigenous land\nAs well as the loss of their kin and the land conflicts, the Xokleng also had to contend with a dam being built in the 1970s which flooded part of their territory and affected their way of life. Despite the upheaval, the Xokleng maintained a settlement in the area as a form of resistance against eviction claims by the Santa Catarina Environmental Institute.\nIndigenous land claims\nFunai has not yet assessed the potential consequences of the “time limit” judgment but says there are approximately 490 Indigenous land claims. A defendant in the supreme court case, Funai had said before the verdict: “The time limit argument disregards the lengthy history of dispossession and violence against Indigenous peoples, leading to their expulsion from their ancestral lands. That contradicts Indigenous rights enshrined in the Brazilian federal constitution and international treaties ratified by the Brazilian state.”\nRafael Modesto, legal adviser to the Indigenous Missionary Council and lawyer for the Xokleng community, argues that there are no more obstacles to the Indigenous people’s right to occupy their ancestral environment.\nPiles of cut pine and eucalyptus; a deforested and burnt area within the Ibirama-Laklãnõ Indigenous land, where some plantations have been established; the North Dam, which displaced the Xokleng people from their first village\nHowever, non-Indigenous groups, including farmers, landowners and timber companies, still colonise the 37,000-hectare area. The Guardian saw several sections of deforested land with piles of cut-down trees. Instead of the araucaria tree, important to Indigenous people for its pine nuts and its role in the Atlantic Forest ecosystem, there are eucalyptus and pine plantations, which cater to the paper, pulp, and furniture industries and are considered “green deserts” by rights organisations.\nAccording to farmer Francisco Jeremias, representing farmers within the disputed territory, the lands they occupy have deeds and were legitimately sold by the state government of Santa Catarina. Jeremias says: “We have consistently respected the restricted area of 14,000 hectares. My ancestors and grandparents also upheld this boundary; some sections belong to the Indigenous people, while others belong to the farmers. All the farmers bought and hold acts to these lands, some dating back 121 years.”\nAccording to Salesiano Durigon, the farmers’ lawyer, the removal of the “time limit” doctrine will affect 550 families in Santa Catarina.\nYoko Kopacã under the canopy of an araucaria tree.

Nissan cut its full-year net profit forecast by a fifth to $4bn (£2.5bn), reflecting its dependence on a market that accounts for more than a quarter of sales. The scale of the boycott was revealed by October sales figures, which showed that Nissan and its Chinese joint venture sold 64,300 vehicles – a decline of 41% on the same month last year. Toyota and Honda reported Chinese sales slumps of 49% and 41% respectively in September.\nAs well as cutting its full-year profit forecast, Nissan trimmed annual sales forecasts as it estimated that sales in China will come in at 1.175m vehicles in 2012, 175,000 fewer than it thought previously. That helped to put a dent in global forecasts, with Nissan predicting sales of 5.08m vehicles in the year to March 2013, down from its former forecast of 5.35m. Nissan said, however, that there had been signs of a revival in China.\n\"We are gradually seeing signs of recovery [in China],\" said Nissan's chief operating officer, Toshiyuki Shiga. \"Customers are gradually coming back to dealerships.\"\nGermany's BMW said ongoing Chinese demand for luxury vehicles – also a boon for UK carmakers such as Bentley – helped to overcome a weak European performance in the third quarter from July to September. Overall sales rose by 13.7% to a record €18.8bn (£15bn), while net profit rose 16% to €1.3bn. Chinese sales rose by 40% to nearly 80,000 units, overshadowing an anaemic European performance that saw a 2.6% increase in sales, with southern Europe dragging down performance. Even BMW's home market disappointed, as German sales fell by 0.5%.\nMark Fulthorpe, analyst at IHS Automotive, said non-Japanese car makers were benefiting from the Senkaku dispute. \"Who is likely to win if people are walking away from Nissan, Toyota and Honda? It will have significant benefits for German manufacturers and [Korean car makers] Hyundai and Kia.\"\nChina aside, BMW warned of an \"increasingly uncertain market environment\" with the final three months of the year posing difficulties for an industry \"likely to be confronted with adverse business conditions\". With the eurozone area expected to post flat economic growth next year, hopes of a concerted revival in the European car market are slim. In September, European car sales fell for the 12th consecutive month, with Spain posting a 36.8% fall in sales, exceeded only by Greece, with a fall of 48.5%.\nUK car sales in October, published on Tuesday, showed that the domestic market was outperforming the continent. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new car registrations rose 12% compared with October last year to more than 151,000 units. So far this year, the UK car market has grown 5%. The top three sellers in October were the Ford Fiesta, followed by the Vauxhall Corsa in second place and the Ford Focus.\nHowever, a manufacturing expert at Deloitte, David Raistrick, said car makers were preregistering cars - a practice that can flatter monthly sales figures - and 2013 is likely to be a tougher year for the UK market. \"Can the UK defy gravity?

The dispute over the islands, known as the Diaoyu in China, has hit bilateral trade and sent diplomatic relations to their lowest point for decades.\nBeijing began its attempt to broaden the territorial dispute earlier this month when the communist party newspaper, the People's Daily, ran an article in which two Chinese academics challenged Japan's sovereignty over the Ryukyu chain of islands, which includes Okinawa.\nLuo Yuan, a two-star general in the People's Liberation Army, raised the territorial stakes again this week, saying the Ryukyus had started paying tribute to China in 1372, half a millennium before they were seized by Japan.\n\"Let's for now not discuss whether [the Ryukyus] belong to China, they were certainly China's tributary state,\" Luo said in an interview with China News Service. \"I am not saying all former tributary states belong to China, but we can say with certainty that the Ryukyus do not belong to Japan,\" he added, in comments translated by the South China Morning Post.\nThe potential for more diplomatic clashes over territory comes amid fresh criticism of Japan's attitude towards its wartime conduct in China and the Korean peninsula.\nBeijing reacted angrily after the outspoken nationalist mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, said this week that Japan's forced recruitment of Asian women to work in military brothels before and during the second world war had been necessary to maintain discipline among soldiers.\n\"We are appalled and indignant about the Japanese politician's comments boldly challenging humanity and historical justice,\" Hong Lei, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters.\n\"The way they treat the past will determine the way Japan walks toward the future. On what choice Japan will make, its Asian neighbours and the international community will wait and see.\"\nOn Wednesday Hashimoto attempted to clarify his remarks, saying he had not sought to justify the use of so-called comfort women, but was questioning why Japan had been singled out for criticism given that other countries had, he said, operated similar schemes.\nOkinawa, an island of more than 1 million people, hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops stationed in Japan.\nWashington and Tokyo have agreed to reduce Washington's military footprint on Okinawa, but the island is seen as key to the US's ability to respond quickly to maritime provocations by the increasingly robust Chinese navy, as well as a crisis on the Korean peninsula.\nIn their People's Daily article, Li Guoqiang and Zhang Haipeng, prominent academics at the government-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Japan's annexation of the Ryukyu kingdom in 1879 amounted to an invasion, and that the sovereignty issue remained open to question.\nThey pointed out that the kingdom had previously been a Chinese vassal state, adding that the ruling Qing dynasty had been too weak to resist Japan's advance.\n\"Hanging in the balance of history, the unresolved problem of the Ryukyus has finally arrived at the time for reconsideration,\" they wrote.\nIn a later article for the paper's sister publication, the Global Times, Li said: \"Not only is Japan obliterating the truth about the Ryukyu issue, but it is doubling its aggressiveness and making provocations over the Diaoyu issue. Therefore it is necessary to revisit the Ryukyu issue.\"\nChina's foreign ministry dismissed Japanese protests over the article.\nHua Chunying, a ministry spokeswoman, told reporters that China \"does not accept Japan's representations or protests\". She said the article reflected renewed interest in the islands in the light of Japan's provocative actions over the Senkakus.\nJapan's government effectively nationalised three of the disputed islets after buying them from their private owners last year, sparking violent protests across China and forcing the temporary closure of Japanese businesses in the country.\nOkinawa, scene of one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific war, was controlled by the US until it was returned to Japan on 15 May 1972.\nThe continued presence of US troops and military hardware is a constant source of tension with the civilian population, who complain about crimes by soldiers, noise pollution and the potential for accidents involving aircraft.\nAnalysts said China was mistaken if it believed that provoking Japan over Okinawa would add momentum to its claims to the Senkaku islands. \"If China's goal is to hold talks with Japan over the Senkakus, articles like these are counterproductive,\" M Taylor Fravel, a Chinese foreign policy expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Associated Press.\n\"As a result, Japan has an even stronger incentive now to stand firm with China and not hold talks.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"China is escalating its territorial dispute with Japan by challenging Tokyo's sovereignty over the island of Okinawa.

{"num":31,"Time":"Tue 12 Jul 2016 19.21 CEST","Title":"Beijing rejects tribunal's ruling in South China Sea case","Content":"China has said it will not accept a ruling against it in a key international legal case over strategic reefs and atolls that Beijing claims would give it control over disputed waters of the South China Sea.\nThe judgment by an international tribunal in The Hague came down overwhelmingly in favour of claims by the Philippines and is likely to increase global diplomatic pressure on Beijing to scale back military expansion in the area. By depriving certain outcrops of territorial-generating status, the ruling from the permanent court of arbitration effectively punches holes in China’s all-encompassing “nine-dash” line that stretches deep into the South China Sea.\nThe Chinese president, Xi Jinping, said China’s “territorial sovereignty and marine rights” in the seas would not be affected by the ruling, which declared large areas of the sea to be neutral international waters or the exclusive economic zones of other countries. He insisted China was still “committed to resolving disputes” with its neighbours.\nChinese state media reacted angrily to the verdict. Xinhua, the country’s official news agency, hit out at what it described as an “ill-founded” ruling that was “naturally null and void”. The Communist party mouthpiece newspaper the People’s Daily said in an editorial that the tribunal had ignored “basic truths” and “trampled” on international laws and norms.\n“The Chinese government and the Chinese people firmly oppose [the ruling] and will neither acknowledge it nor accept it,” it added.\nThe Philippine foreign affairs secretary, Perfecto Yasay Jr, said the country welcomed the ruling and called for “restraint and sobriety”. The US State Department called on both parties to comply with their obligations, according to a statement from spokesman John Kirby.\nThe ruling makes grim reading for Beijing and contains a series of criticisms of China’s actions and claims. The tribunal declared that “although Chinese navigators and fishermen, as well as those of other states, had historically made use of the islands in the South China Sea, there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or their resources.\n“The tribunal concluded that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling within the ‘nine-dash line’.”\nNone of the fiercely disputed Spratly Islands, the UN body found, were “capable of generating extended maritime zones … [and] having found that none of the features claimed by China was capable of generating an exclusive economic zone, the tribunal found that it could — without delimiting a boundary — declare that certain sea areas are within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, because those areas are not overlapped by any possible entitlement of China.”\nThe tribunal found that China had violated the Philippines’ sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone by interfering with Philippine fishing and petroleum exploration, constructing artificial islands and failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from fishing in the zone. At Scarborough Shoal, where it said fishermen from the Philippines and China had traditional fishing rights, it said China had restricted these rights. It added that China had created a serious risk of collision when its patrol boats had physically obstructed Philippine fishing vessels.\nSouth China Sea dispute: what you need to know about The Hague court ruling\nRead more\nThe tribunal also condemned China’s land reclamation projects and its construction of artificial islands at seven features in the Spratly Islands, concluding that it had caused “severe harm to the coral reef environment and violated its obligation to preserve and protect fragile ecosystems and the habitat of depleted, threatened, or endangered species”.\nLand reclamation “was incompatible with the obligations on a state during dispute resolution proceedings”, it added, since it involved causing “irreparable harm to the marine environment”, building a “large artificial island in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone”, and destroying “evidence of the natural condition of features in the South China Sea that formed part of the parties’ dispute”.\nPaul Reichler, of the law firm Foley Hoag LLP, who who coordinated the Philippines’ legal team, said: “The tribunal’s ruling not only benefits the Philippines, it also benefits other states bordering the South China Sea like Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. If China’s nine-dash line is invalid as to the Philippines, it is equally invalid to those states and, indeed, the rest of the international community.”\nImage from a US Navy surveillance aircraft purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief reef in the disputed Spratly islands. Photograph: HANDOUT\/Reuters\nBeijing claims 90% of the South China Sea, a maritime region believed to hold a wealth of untapped oil and gas reserves and through which roughly $4.5tn of ship-borne trade passes every year. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also contest China’s claims to islands and reef systems closer to their territory than Beijing’s.\nChina says it follows a historical precedent set by the “nine-dash line” that Beijing drew in 1947 following the surrender of Japan. The line has been included in subsequent maps issued under Communist rule.\nSporadic violence between Chinese vessels and those of south-east Asia militaries have broken out in recent decades and the verdict, the first international legal decision on the issue, could have unpredictable consequences.\nAshley Townshend, a scholar at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre, said the tribunal’s decision to disqualify China’s “nine-dash” claim on the basis of historic rights was “a huge setback for Beijing”. China had stirred up so much nationalism over the South China Sea issue that it would now have to respond in some way.\n'We won't have to live in fear anymore': readers on the South China Sea ruling\nRead more\n“In terms of China’s domestic politics [the ruling] is unacceptable to the regime and unfortunately the regime will perceive that the Chinese people view that as unacceptable,” Townshend predicted.\n“So there will be huge pressures on Beijing to respond, to save face, to demonstrate with more than just words that it doesn’t abide by and doesn’t credit the ruling with any legal validity and will not adhere to it and will defend its ‘sovereign space’ in the South China Sea.”\nTownshend said he did not expect Beijing to lash out militarily but believed further military drills in the South China Sea were possible as well as the establishment of an air defence identification zone somewhere over the region.\nXu Liping, a pro-Beijing scholar from China’s National Institute of International Strategy, told the Guardian he believed the ruling was “biased and unfair”, “absolutely terrible” and “a joke”.\nThe nationalistic Global Times tabloid attacked the ruling in an English language editorial on Tuesday night as “more radical and shameless than many people had ever expected”, saying it had “brazenly violated China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights.”\nThe newspaper, which is controlled by the Communist party and sometimes reflects its thinking, also warned of a military escalation. “If the US and Japan use [the ruling] to pile military and political pressure on Beijing, Chinese people will firmly support our government to launch a tit-for-tat counterpunch,” it said. “We trust Chinese law enforcement and military forces have been well-prepared.”\nThe case at the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague, the UN-appointed tribunal that adjudicates in international disputes over maritime territory, has been running since 2013. Philippe Sands QC, who represented the Philippines in the hearing, said: “This is the most significant international legal case for almost the past 20 years since the Pinochet judgment.”\nThe judgment does not allocate any of the outcrops or islands to rival countries but instead indicates which maritime features are capable under international law of generating territorial rights over surrounding seas.\nLast year, US officials claimed the Chinese had built up an extra 800 hectares (2,000 acres) on their occupied outposts across the South China Sea over the previous 18 months. The main focus of activity has been on Mischief Reef, where satellite images reveal the island is growing bigger, and is surrounded by fleets of dredgers and tankers.\nChina has previously stated that it “will neither accept nor participate in the arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines”. The tribunal ruled, however, that China’s refusal to participate did not deprive the court of jurisdiction.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about a tribunal's ruling in the South China Sea case.

The act was described at the time by India’s ministry as restoring the area on both sides to the “pre-standoff period”.\nThe dispute centres along the line of actual control (LAC), which divides areas of physical control, rather than territorial claims, and separates Chinese-held and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India’s eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. It is broken into parts where Nepal and Bhutan border China.\nAccording to India, the control line is 2,167 miles (3,488km) long, while China says it is considerably shorter.\nTensions over the disputed section of border in the Himalayas exploded in June 2020, when at least 24 soldiers died during violent clashes. Indian authorities said 20 of its soldiers had died, while Beijing confirmed just four Chinese deaths. It was the deadliest event between the two nuclear powers in 50 years. After the clashes, in which soldiers fought with sticks and rocks in hand-to-hand combat, the two countries stationed hundreds of thousands of soldiers backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets along the LAC.\nAmid claims of continuing encroachment by the Chinese military, top military leaders from both sides have since met 16 times to negotiate and there have been several disengagements.

All kinds of digital objects - including images, videos, music and text - can be bought and sold as NFTs.\nIn a statement to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Nemus said it had “requested and received formal approval from FUNAI (Brazil’s indigenous affairs agency) to navigate along the Seruini River”, which is the traditional access route to the region where the land underlying the NFTs is located.\nA promotional video issued on July 20 by Nemus shows Silvio Antonio de Souza, a man from the indigenous Apurina community, going to the local notary’s office and allegedly changing the name of the land claimed by the company to “Non-Fungible Territory”, in a play on the NFT acronym.\nAntonio de Souza could not be reached for comment but his son told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that his father was not given a copy of the document.\nNormally, changing the name of the area would require consensus among the whole community, said Daniel Lima of the Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI), a Brazilian non-profit group.\nLAND DISPUTES\nNemus says it owns 41,000 hectares (101,313 acres) of forest in the Amazon. On its official website, the company provides a digital map app.nemus.earth\/map of an area in the municipality of Pauini, in the state of Amazonas - one of its plots that have already been divided into hundreds of squares, each one equivalent to an NFT.\nBut Melquisedeque Lopes Soaris Apurina, a local indigenous leader, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the NFT company’s claim to the land was illegitimate.\n“(Nemus) said they would buy the land and give it to us. But we already lived there - our veterans, grandfathers, great grandfathers all died there,” he said.\n“They say they want to buy the land to preserve the forest. But we are preservers, we have been here for a long time and it was never deforested.”\nApurina leaders say the land sits in an area that has been going through a government process since 2012 that could lead to its official recognition as territory of the Apurina people.\nCIMI worked with community members to alert Brazilian prosecutors to the NFT situation, according to Lima.\nAccording to official maps from the state of Amazonas consulted by CIMI and another green group, IPAM Amazonia, the territory is classified as a public forest - although such maps do not always log private ownership.\nIn a phone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation from the U.S. state of Florida, Nemus founder Flavio de Meira Penna denied claims by CIMI that the land is public property.\n“I do not know where this came from - it (the land) is private; it belonged to a family from Sao Paulo for more than 40 years,” Penna said, adding that the family had owned a nut plantation in the area.\nThis information concurs with the statement from Nemus, which noted that the territory “is not in any Indigenous Land or Reservation” and is “duly registered in the Public Notary of Pauini”.\nLand ownership is a constant source of disputes in the Brazilian Amazon. The Brazilian Constitution guarantees indigenous communities the right to traditional territories.\nBut parts of the forest have been historically transferred to non-indigenous private owners.\nThe Amazon is also plagued by a centuries-long practice of illegal privatization through land seizures - some of which have been retroactively recognized by the government as legal.\nGREEN BLOCKCHAIN\nNemus is part of a growing constellation of cryptocurrency companies that say they want to leverage blockchain technology to help preserve nature and fight climate change.\nOther efforts include turning carbon offsets into digital tokens, initiatives to log forest preservation programs on blockchain digital ledgers, and projects to create crypto-based financial derivatives to fund green projects.\nIn a March interview with Reuters here, Penna said he hoped to raise up to $5 million to buy another two million hectares of land already under negotiation in Pauini.\nBuyers of the Nemus NFTs - which cover plots ranging from a quarter of a hectare to 81 hectares, and cost as little as $250 - said they expected their money to go towards preserving the rainforest.\nBhavesh Bati, a solar energy entrepreneur who recently bought an NFT from Nemus, said it had “always been my dream to buy rainforest lands and keep it aside fully protected”.\n“In Nemus, I saw that I can buy a parcel and with my little money I can help with conservation efforts there on the ground,” he added.\nJohn Reed Stark, a former head of the Office of Internet Enforcement at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that people who buy NFTs rarely understand what they are purchasing, which could lead to them being misled.\n\"I am not surprised by the fact that someone would use the hook (that) you are helping the rainforest to sell an NFT,\" he said.

In the newly created buffer zones, neither side will be allowed to patrol their troops.\nNevertheless, local Indian residents, elected representatives of the region and former Indian military officers who have served along the disputed border in Ladakh are claiming that the new “buffer zones” have been established in areas previously under Indian control.\nTensions remain high as hopes dashed for breakthrough in China and India stalemate\nRead more\nMeanwhile, they allege Chinese troop positions remain either in contested areas or much inside the Indian territory.\n“Our army is vacating areas which were not disputed at all, while Chinese troops are stationed in the areas traditionally patrolled by India,” said Konchok Stanzin, an elected councillor from the region.\nStanzin claimed that India had already given up territory to China during a 2021 agreement to withdraw from contested areas around Ladakh’s Lake Pangong. “We raised similar concerns in earlier disengagement, like in the Pangong Tso area where our army again lost a huge area,” he said.\nMany people in the local area spoke of concerns not only for their security but the consequences the loss of land to Chinese troops was having on their livelihoods. “We are losing massive pastures, which we would use as grazing land,” said Stanzin, who belongs, like most of the people in the area, to the tribal Changpa cattle herders community. Their main sources of living have been cashmere wool-producing Changra goats.\n“Earlier, our concern was about Chinese incursions only but now the situation is more worrying as our government is giving up our land happily,” he said. “If India’s approach remains the same, we are going to lose more land.”\nIndia’s main opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Narendra Modi’s government of “giving 1,000 sq km [390 sq miles] of territory to China without a fight”.\nThe recent withdrawal consensus was reached last week, during the 16th round of bilateral talks between leading Indian and Chinese military commanders. The two sides claimed to have agreed to disengage from respective sides in the area of Gogra-Hot Springs in a move “conducive to the peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.\nTashi Chhepal, a retired Indian army captain who served in Gogra-Hot Springs area around 1997, said that the areas now declared “buffer zones”, where neither Indian or Chinese troops will be positioned, had previously been patrolled by Indian troops.\n“We would patrol these areas where Chinese posts are now located, leave aside the buffer zones, which are clearly in our territory,” said Chhepal. “Ideally, the Chinese should also have moved behind their patrolling area, but that does not seem to be the case.”\nThe pullback of troops has been the second disengagement act since August 2021, when troops “ceased forward deployments” and dismantled infrastructure in another area in the region where tensions escalated in June 2020, when at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers died during the deadliest clashes between the two nuclear powers in 50 years.\nAfter the violent altercation, in which soldiers fought with sticks and rocks in hand-to-hand combat, the two countries stationed hundreds of thousands of soldiers backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets along the disputed border, militarising the region like never before.\nAfter the 2020 clash, tensions soared to extraordinary levels, with deployment of 200,000 troops on both sides of the frontier in this inhospitable high-altitude terrain, where the temperature drops as low as -40C (-40F) in winters. There was also unprecedented artillery and infrastructure buildup on both sides of the 2,100-mile border, including when China invaded India in 1962.\nAs a result, relations between India and China have remained icy. On Friday, Modi and President Xi Jinping of China were present at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, the first time they had met since the clashes, but no handshakes or meetings were held between the two leaders.\nIndia’s military leaders called the disengagement a positive step that decreased the chances of a physical confrontation between the rival troops, who have been positioned almost nose-to-nose at certain points. In the area recently declared a buffer zone, China was reported to have built a temporary army base that has since been taken down.\n“The idea of buffer zones is to disengage so that troops are not face to face with each other and problems do not occur,” said Deepender Singh Hooda, the Indian army’s former head of northern command, which also includes the Ladakh region. “For example, in some areas tanks were within 100 metres of each other.”\nThe negotiations appear to be part of efforts by the Modi government to defuse the tensions along the border in order to portray the idea that India has been successful in dealing with an increasingly hostile China.\nNevertheless, Hooda was among those who said India had still been unable to get China to withdraw from the most strategically important border regions, including the Depsang and Demchok areas of Ladakh “where the Chinese are preventing Indian troops from patrolling a very large number of places”.\nThe area, home to a huge buildup of Chinese troops, is tactically important to India because of its proximity to India’s Daulat Beg Oldi military airbase and Shiachen glacier, the world’s highest battlefield, where India’s nemesis, Pakistan, has a strategic presence.\n“That is the area where the biggest problem is,” said Hooda.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about the Indian government being accused of ceding land in the Himalayas to China.

{"num":50,"Time":"July 5, 2023","Title":"China's rare earths dominance in focus after it limits germanium and gallium exports ","Content":"July 5 (Reuters) - China said on Monday it will impose export restrictions on gallium and germanium products used in computer chips and other components to protect national security interests.\nThe decision, widely seen as retaliation for U.S. curbs on sales of technologies to China, raised concerns that China might eventually limit exports of other materials, notably rare earths, whose production China dominates.\nIn 2010, China restricted exports of rare earths to Japan following a territorial dispute, sending prices soaring and Japan scrambling to find alternative sources. Beijing said the curbs were based on environmental concerns.\nBelow are some facts about rare earths, about China's dominance of the sector, and what countries are doing to ease their dependence on China for the materials.\nWHAT ARE RARE EARTHS AND HOW ARE THEY USED?\nRare earths are a group of 17 elements used in products from lasers and military equipment to magnets found in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and consumer electronics such as iPhones.\nThe 17 elements are: lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium.\nHOW DOMINANT IS CHINA IN THE RARE EARTHS SUPPLY CHAIN?\nMining: China accounted for 70% of world mine production of rare earths in 2022, followed by the United States, Australia, Myanmar and Thailand, United States Geological Survey (USGS) data shows.\nProcessing: China is home to at least 85% of the world's capacity to process rare earth ores into material manufacturers can use, according to research firm Adamas Intelligence in 2019.\nExports: Chinese exports of rare earths have declined. The country exported 20,987 metric tonnes in the first five months of 2023, down 4.4% year-on-year, Chinese customs data showed.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nChina exported 48,728 metric tonnes of rare earths in 2022, down 0.4% year-on-year.\nThe United States sources most of its rare earth imports from China, but that dependence has eased to 74% between 2018 and 2021, from 80% during 2014 to 2017.\nWHICH COUNTRIES HAVE THE MOST RARE EARTHS RESERVES?\nChina is estimated to have 44 million metric tonnes of rare earth oxide (ROE) equivalent in reserves, or 34% of the world total, USGS data showed.\nVietnam, Russia and Brazil are estimated to have just over 20 million metric tonnes each, while India has 6.9 million, Australia has 4.2 million and the United States has 2.3 million metric tonnes.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nReuters Graphics\nWHAT HAPPENED IN 2010?\nIn 2010, China withheld exports of rare earth to Japan during a row over disputed islands. Beijing then curbed global exports of rare earths, saying it was trying to curtail pollution and preserve resources.\nJapan, the European Union and the United States successfully challenged China's action in a case at the World Trade Organization.\nThe episode led Japan, which had relied on China for virtually all of its rare earths, to find alternative suppliers to ease its reliance on China. It invested in Australian producer Lynas (LYC.AX) and had reduced the share of its imports of rare earths from China to 58% by 2018.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nWHY IS IT HARD FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO RAMP UP PRODUCTION?\nRare earths are relatively abundant but occur in low concentrations and are usually found mixed together with one another, or with radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium.\nThe chemical properties of rare earths make them difficult to separate from surrounding materials, and processing generates toxic waste.\nLax environmental standards enabled China to build its dominance in rare earths in recent decades as Western producers left the industry.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nWHAT ARE OTHER COUNTRIES DOING TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON CHINA?\nWestern countries have ramped up support to boost domestic production of critical minerals including rare earths.\nAustralia, Canada, the European Union and the United States have set out policies and support packages for their critical minerals sectors.\nLas Vegas-based MP Materials (MP.N) mines rare earth oxides at the Mountain Pass mine in California, but ships them to China for processing into neodymium and other rare earth metals, as there is no final processing in the United States.\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA.O) is moving away from rare earths in future models to mitigate environmental and supply risks, as the rare earth industry struggles to meet demand.\nCHINA QUOTA\nChina raised its full-year mining quota for rare earths for the fifth consecutive year in 2022 to 210,000 metric tonnes, up 25% from a year earlier.\nThe quota system, usually issued in two batches a year, was put in place in response to China's longstanding problems with illegal mining.\nQuotas for mining in the first batch of this year also increased.\nReporting by Mai Nguyen in Hanoi; Additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne and Dominique Patton in Beijing; Editing by Tony Munroe and Barbara Lewis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAcquire Licensing Rights\n, opens new tab\nMai Nguyen\nThomson Reuters\nMai reports on the nonferrous metals markets in Asia.

{"num":47,"Time":"Fri 29 Sep 2023 03.57 CEST","Title":"‘Risk of miscalculation’ rises in South China Sea as Beijing ramps up aggressive tactics","Content":"I\nn shaky camera footage, a member of the Philippine coast guard can be seen dipping below the waters of South China Sea, ready to carry out the instructions of the country’s president. “Just cut it off,” says a voice in the background and the coast guard, posing as a fisher in a snorkel, proceeds to hack away at a piece of rope.\nThe video, taken on Monday near the fiercely contested Scarborough Shoal, shows the Philippines’ mission to remove what it described as a hazardous floating barrier installed by China’s coast guard. It had been erected to cut off access to Philippine boats, the Philippine coast guard alleged, accusing their counterparts of violating international law. China has defended its actions as “professional and restrained”.\nThe episode was the latest in an intensifying dispute over the South China Sea – a row that, were it to escalate, could bring the US, a Philippine ally, into confrontation with its rival, China.\nManila has, over the past year, repeatedly accused Beijing of dangerous and aggressive tactics in the South China Sea, including allegations that China directed a military-grade laser at a Philippine vessel and that it aimed water cannon at Philippine boats as they travelled within their country’s exclusive economic zone.\n“The risk [of] miscalculation is getting higher because of China’s escalation,” says Jay L Batongbacal, a lawyer and professor at the University of the Philippines.\nBeijing has rejected the notion that it is an aggressor and has said it supports dialogue with the Philippines. Last month, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, accused the US of provoking conflict between Beijing and Manila, saying it had “disrupted the peace and tranquillity of the South China Sea, to serve the United States’ own geopolitical strategy”.\nEfforts to dislodge a ‘legal reality’\nThe dispute over the South China Sea is long-running and delicate. China claims the South China Sea almost in its entirety, maintaining it has historic claims to the reefs and rocks that dot the waters – although a UN tribunal found this to be without legal basis. China has repeatedly and publicly rejected The Hague’s ruling. The Philippines, as well as Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have competing claims.\nPhilippe Sands KC, who acted as a lawyer for the Philippines in the 2016 tribunal case, said the award was final. “No amount of political, diplomatic or economic effort is going to dislodge that legal reality,” he said.\nHe added that it was “fair to conclude that the efforts to build up maritime features [such as the floating barrier near the Scarborough Shoal], sovereignty over which is disputed, is problematic under international law”.\nThe US is not a claimant in the South China Sea dispute but considers the waters, which are one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, to be key to its national interests. It also counts the Philippines as its oldest treaty ally in Asia.\nThe South China Sea is highly important for the Philippines – both due to its rich supply of fish and its oil and natural gas reserves, which are increasingly significant as Manila faces a looming energy crisis.\nPhilippine fishermen on wooden boats sail past a Chinese coast guard ship near the Chinese-controlled Scarborough Shoal. Photograph: Ted Aljibe\/AFP\/Getty Images\nFor China, the sea has both importance for political legitimacy domestically, for its energy resources and strategic importance, say analysts, and is considered a key part of its defence. China “aspires to create a security buffer” around its coastline, says Batongbacal.\nThe South China Sea is also believed to be the bastion of China’s sea-based nuclear deterrent, says Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. China bases most of its nuclear ballistic missile submarines in Hainan Island, he said. “It is where China will be able to project what we call second-strike capability against its potential adversaries, such as the US [and] India.”\nThe South China Sea is important to Beijing for wider defensive reasons, Koh added. “In the event of a conflict over Taiwan, the South China Sea is the southern flank that China has to secure.”\nLast month, China released a new map that featured a 10-dash line, rather than the typical nine-dash, including democratically governed Taiwan as part of its territory.\nOver the past decade, China has bolstered its presence in the South China Sea by constructing and fortifying artificial islands. According to the US, these have been equipped with various facilities, including anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment and fighter jets.\nChina has denied that it is militarising the waters, saying it supports peace and stability.\nWhether Beijing has further plans to build artificial features is unclear, says Raymond M Powell, a fellow at Stanford University’s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation in the US. China has not yet developed Scarborough Shoal, which it seized in 2012. “What we’ve seen happen instead is they just have this much greater presence campaign by using the existing artificial features, especially the ports, to forward-project their forces, especially their maritime militia and their coast guard,” said Powell. Vessels instead swarm key features, or are tethered, to create “a floating outpost”, he added.\nResearch by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, found the China coast guard’s presence was “more robust than ever” in 2022 and that it maintained near-daily patrols at key features across sea.\nA looming dilemma for Manila\nUnder the president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who came to power in June 2022, the Philippines has taken a firmer stance against China than the previous government, publicly denouncing and sharing footage of alleged aggression by China. This year has been an inflection point, said Powell, adding that the Philippines was actively publicising so-called “grey zone” activities by China – actions that are coercive but that fall below the threshold for warfare.\nDoing so could help build greater willingness domestically to invest in defence and had helped build greater international support, he added. Earlier this year the Philippines expanded US access to its military bases and has deepened ties with others including Japan and Australia.\nThe Philippines now faces a looming dilemma over how to sustain its presence at Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, where a rusting second world war ship, which was deliberately grounded there in the late 1990s, serves as a base for a small number of Philippine troops.\nIt’s feared that attempts to build or replace the base would provoke a response from China, which also claims the site, but that the structure cannot survive in its current condition indefinitely.\nUS support has so far been limited to “intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions” when the Philippines has rotation and reprovisioning missions, said Aaron Jed Rabena, a research fellow at Asia-Pacific Pathways to Progress, a Manila-based thinktank. It is unclear whether this would be stepped up.\nAfter its mission to remove the barrier blocking access to Scarbarough Shoal this week, Philippine coastguard spokesperson Cdr Jay Tarriela told CNN Philippines that the country was “going to consistently carry out whatever is necessary for us to maintain our presence”.\nKoh said he believed it unlikely China would soften its stance. “But there will come a time when those grey zone tactics and the successes that came with it in the past, will run [their] course. And then the question will be what will be next for China?”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about the intensifying dispute over the South China Sea, particularly near the Scarborough Shoal.

Then, in 1895, they gave up the island to Japan after losing the first Sino Japanese war.\nChina took the island again in 1945 after Japan lost World War Two.\nBut a civil war erupted in mainland China between nationalist government forces led by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong's Communist Party.\nThe communists won in 1949 and took control in Beijing.\nChiang Kai-shek and what was left of the nationalist party - known as the Kuomintang - fled to Taiwan, where they ruled for the next several decades.\nChina points to this history to say that Taiwan was originally a Chinese province. But the Taiwanese point to the same history to argue that they were never part of the modern Chinese state that was first formed after the revolution in 1911 - or the People's Republic of China that was established under Mao in 1949.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nChiang Kai-shek led the Kuomintang after fleeing to Taiwan\nThe Kuomintang has been one of Taiwan's most prominent political parties ever since - ruling the island for a significant part of its history.\nCurrently, only 13 countries (plus the Vatican) recognise Taiwan as a sovereign country.\nChina exerts considerable diplomatic pressure on other countries not to recognise Taiwan, or to do anything which implies recognition.\nCan Taiwan defend itself?\nChina could attempt to bring about \"reunification\" by non-military means such as strengthening economic ties.\nBut in any military confrontation, China's armed forces would dwarf those of Taiwan.\nChina spends more than any country except the US on defence and could draw on a huge range of capabilities, from naval power to missile technology, aircraft and cyber attacks.\nMuch of China's military power is focused elsewhere but, in overall terms of active duty personnel for example, there is a huge imbalance between the two sides.\nIn an open conflict, some Western experts predict that Taiwan could at best aim to slow a Chinese attack, try to prevent a shore landing by Chinese amphibious forces, and mount guerrilla strikes while waiting for outside help.\nThat help could come from the US which sells arms to Taiwan.\nUntil now, Washington's policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" has meant the US has been deliberately unclear about whether or how it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack.\nDiplomatically, the US currently sticks to the \"One-China\" policy, which recognises only one Chinese government - in Beijing - and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan.\nBut in May last year, US President Joe Biden appeared to harden Washington's position.\nAsked whether the US would defend Taiwan militarily, Mr Biden replied: \"Yes.\"\nThe White House insisted that Washington had not changed its position.\nIs the situation getting worse?\nRelations between Taiwan and China deteriorated sharply following a visit to the island by the then US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in August 2022.\nBeijing condemned Ms Pelosi's visit as \"extremely dangerous\".\nChina launched a series of military exercises, including the firing of ballistic missiles, focused on six danger zones around Taiwan, three of which overlapped the island's territorial waters.\nTaiwan said the move, which forced ships and planes to find routes around those areas, violated its sovereignty and amounted to a blockade.\nTensions between China and Taiwan had already been increasing.\nIn 2021, China appeared to ramp up pressure by sending military aircraft into Taiwan's Air Defence Zone, a self-declared area where foreign aircraft are identified, monitored, and controlled in the interests of national security.\nThe numbers of aircraft reported peaked in October 2021 at 56 incursions in a single day, with Taiwan's defence minister saying relations were the worst they had been for 40 years.\nSince then there have been 22 days with more than 20 incursions reported.\nTaiwan made data on plane incursions public in 2020.\nChina's coastguard claims it has the legal authority to stop and inspect shipping in the area around Taiwan.\nOn Wednesday, it said \"on-site inspections\" on some vessels would commence.\nTaiwan has objected to the move and has instructed Taiwanese vessels not to co-operate with attempts to board and inspect them.\nWhy is Taiwan important for the rest of the world?\nTaiwan's economy is hugely important.\nMuch of the world's everyday electronic equipment - from phones to laptops, watches and games consoles - is powered by computer chips made in Taiwan.\nBy one measure, a single Taiwanese company - the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC - has over half of the world's market.\nTSMC is a so-called \"foundry\" - a company which makes chips designed by consumer and military customers. It is a vast industry, worth almost $100bn (£73bn) in 2021.\nA Chinese takeover in Taiwan could give Beijing some control over one of the world's most important industries.\nAre the Taiwanese people worried?\nDespite the recent tensions between China and Taiwan, research suggests that many Taiwanese people are relatively untroubled.\nIn October 2021 the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation asked people whether they thought that there would, eventually, be war with China.\nAlmost two thirds (64.3%) replied that they did not.\nSeparate research indicates that most people in Taiwan identify as Taiwanese - embracing a distinctly different identity.\nSurveys conducted by the National Chengchi University since the early 1990s indicate that the proportion of people who identify as Chinese, or both Chinese and Taiwanese, has fallen and that most people consider themselves as Taiwanese.\nThis article was amended in July 2022 to provide more historical background about Taiwan's status.\nYou may also be interested in...\nWhy China could win the new global arms race\nRelated Topics\nTaiwan","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"China has sent warships, including an aircraft carrier, into the seas around Taiwan.

No one has been arrested, a police spokesman said.\nWatchdog groups said police were questioning land activists about the possibility the killings could have resulted from an internal conflict within their movement. The groups rejected that idea and accused landowners of paying gunmen to shoot the activists.\nCarlos Calazans, head of the Minas Gerais branch of the federal department of land reform, known as Incra, said police were looking into the land dispute as a possible motive.\n\"It's definitely one of the theories for the motive behind this barbarous crime,\" he said. \"I've no doubt these activists were summarily executed. But police have to follow all leads until they find the truth.\"\nCalazans said the killed couple approached Incra last year seeking support in various land conflicts in the region, including the one with the mill owners. He said Incra tried to get the owners and activists to agree on the issue a few weeks ago, but the effort was unsuccessful.\nKillings over land in Brazil are common, and people rarely face trial for the crimes.\nThe watchdog group Catholic Land Pastoral says more than 1,150 rural activists have been murdered in Brazil over the past 20 years. The killings are mostly carried out by gunmen hired by loggers, ranchers and farmers to silence protests over illegal logging and land rights, it says. Most of the killings happen in the Amazon region.\nFewer than 100 cases have gone to court since 1988, Catholic Land Pastoral says. About 80 of the hired gunmen have been convicted, while 15 of the men who hired them were found guilty, and only one is currently in prison.\nAccording to Incra, those killed on Saturday were Clestina Leonor Sales Nunes, 48; Milton Santos Nunes da Silva, 52; and Valdir Dias Ferreira, 39.\nThe girl was apparently the only witness to the killings, which were carried out along a highway near the camp, about 25 miles (40km) south-east of Uberlandia. She told police a car cut off the one she was riding in with the victims, forcing it to stop. Either one or two gunmen then opened fire.\nA statement on the Catholic Land Pastoral's website described the three victims as state leaders of the Landless Liberation Movement, one of several rural activist groups that invade land and set up camp, living on what they say is unproductive ground.\nBrazil's agrarian reform laws allow the government to seize fallow farmland and distribute it to landless farmers. Nearly 50% of arable land belongs to 1% of the population, according to the government's statistics agency.\nThe latest killings come just before the month that landless worker movements typically step up invasions of what they say is unused land.

Tensions flared in 2014 when China installed exploratory oil rigs in the vicinity.\nThe situation is more complicated in the Spratlys, which Beijing calls the Nansha islands.\nThe archipelago consists of 100 smalls islands and reefs of which 45 are occupied by China, Malaysia, Vietnam or the Philippines.\nAll of the islands are claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam, while parts of them are claimed by the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.\nChina is actually relatively late to the party when it comes to occupying territory in the Spratly archipelago, starting its occupation of reefs and islands in the area in the 1980s.\nTaiwan first occupied an island in the Spratlys after World War II, and the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia followed suit, and all have built outposts and airstrips on their claimed territory, according to Mira Rapp-Hooper, a Senior Fellow in Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS).\nREAD: Washington ‘not provoking’ China\nWhat’s China been building?\nSatellite imagery from 30 March, 7 August 2014 and 30 January 2015 shows the extent of Chinese progress in building an island at Gaven Reefs in the Spratly Islands.\nIn early 2014, China quietly began massive dredging operations centering on the seven reefs it controls in the Spratly Islands – Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef, Mischief Reef, Cuarteron Reef, Gaven Reef and Hughes Reef.\nAccording to the U.S., China has reclaimed 3,000 acres since the beginning of 2014.\nVietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan have also reclaimed land in the South China Sea, but their land grab – the U.S. says approximately 100 acres over 45 years – is dwarfed by China’s massive, recent buildup.\nIn September 2015, during his trip to Washington, President Xi Jinping said China wouldn’t “militarize” the islands but is building three airstrips that analysts believe will be able to accommodate bombers, according to satellite images analyzed by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\nChina has had a military presence on Woody Island, in the Paracels, for half a century and in February deployed surface-to-air missiles and fighter jets on the island.\nThe Philippines, which lies geographically closest to the Spratlys, has troops stationed in the area, as do other claimants. There are no indigenous inhabitants.\nHow has the U.S. responded?\nThe U.S. government takes no position on the territorial disputes in the South China Sea but it has called for an immediate end to land reclamation.\nIt also sails and flies its assets in the vicinity of the reclaimed islands, citing international law and freedom of movement.\nIn May 2015, it flew over man-made islands in the Spratlys with a CNN crew on board, triggering repeated warnings from the Chinese navy.\nIn October, it sent a warship, the USS Lassen, to within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef. It conducted a similar Freedom of Navigation (FON) operation in January 2016.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nHigh stakes surveillance over the South China Sea\n03:47 - Source: CNN\n“We will fly, sail and operate anywhere in the world that international law allows,” a U.S. defense official told CNN in October.\n“U.S. Freedom of Navigation operations are global in scope and executed against a wide range of excessive maritime claims, irrespective of the coastal state advancing the excessive claim,” the official added.\nWhat’s China’s stance?\nChina says both the Paracels and the Spratlys are an “integral part” of its territory, offering up maps that date back to the early 20th century.\nIt defends its right to build both civil and defensive facilities on the islands it controls.\nVIDEO\nSouth China Sea territorial dispute\nBeijing also says it upholds the right of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea but Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned in March 2016 that this didn’t equal the “freedom to run amok.”\nChina says its control over the disputed waters is justified because it was the first to discover them.\n“China was the earliest to explore, name, develop and administer various South China Sea islands. Our ancestors worked diligently here for generations,” Wang said.\n“History will prove who is the visitor and who is the genuine host.”\nWhat does international law say?\nInternational maritime law doesn’t accord 12 nautical miles of “territorial waters” to artificial islands – only natural features visible at high tide.\nNor does reclaimed land qualify for a 200 nautical mile “exclusive economic zone (EEZ),” which gives a country special rights such as over exploration of the sea bed and fishing.\nBefore China’s frenzy of land reclamation, both Subi and Mischief reefs were submerged at high tide, while a sandbar was visible at high tide at Fiery Cross Reef.\nIn 2013, the Philippines filed a case with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, seeking a ruling on its right to exploit the South China Sea waters within the exclusive economic zone of the islands and reefs it occupies in the South China Sea.\nOn July 12, 2016, the court found in favor of the Philippines and said that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights over the region.\nWhat’s at stake here?\nA key route for shipping, $5 trillion in ship-borne trade is thought to pass through the waters annually.\nThe area is also thought to be rich in natural resources and some areas, particularly around the Malaysian coast and off Vietnam have proven oil and gas fields with billions of barrels of oil and gas equivalent.\nThe dispute is central to China’s position within the region and globally and it attaches huge importance to maintaining control over islands that it claims as its “indisputable sovereign territories.”\nThe current posturing in the area has led to heightened tensions between the world’s preeminent military powers, and in May 2015 former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell told CNN that the confrontation indicates there is “absolutely” a risk of the U.S. and China going to war sometime in the future.\nCNN’s Steven Jiang in Beijing and Euan McKirdy in Hong Kong contributed to this report","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": {\n\"Title\": \"Showdown in the South China Sea: How did we get here?\",\n\"Summary\": \"Tensions have ratcheted up in the South China Sea due to territorial disputes among multiple countries, with China's claims causing significant tensions.

REUTERS\/Yves Herman\nThe criticism came at the first meeting of EU ministers to discuss the plan, which was presented by the Commission last month and entails a 3 percent levy on the digital revenues of large multinational corporations such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.\nBig Web companies are accused by the Commission and some EU states of paying too little tax in Europe, exploiting an outdated system that has allowed them to shift profits to low-tax countries.\nMinisters from smaller nations, including Luxembourg and Malta, opposed the plan at a ministerial meeting in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, arguing that an overhaul of digital taxation should be done globally and involve a long-term solution.\nGerman Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who took office last month, avoided taking a clear line on the issue, in what could be seen as a partial shift from Berlin’s initial open support for a turnover tax.\nHe told a news conference making digital companies pay more taxes was a “moral question” that needed to be addressed. But he refrained from clarifying how to tackle the issue and did not take the floor during the ministerial debate on the matter.\nEuropean officials said Berlin fears several German companies could be hit by the tax, and that international partners may respond with retaliatory tax measures that could damage German exporters.\nSome 200 companies would fall within the scope of the new tax, European officials said, estimating additional annual revenues of about 5 billion euros ($6 billion) at EU level.\n“ILLUSION”\nThe commission said a long-term, global solution based on a new method to calculate tax rights was the preferred option, but it would take a long time to be approved.\nIt pushed in the meantime for a temporary, shorter-term option that would quickly recoup part of the tax revenues lost by EU states to digital giants.\nIt has proposed a temporary levy on corporate turnover, which would be a major shift from existing rules, whereby companies are charged on their profits and pay no tax if they report losses.\nThe move was necessary because it would be an “illusion” to think a deal could be reached soon at global level, EU Tax Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said at the end of the meeting.\nThe EU initiative also seeks to prevent diverging measures in member states that could weaken the single market. But in the absence of a deal, some states are moving alone.\nSpain, which backs the commission’s plans along with larger EU members such as Italy and France, said on Saturday it would introduce its own levy on digital companies.\n“The idea is to introduce it as soon as possible and for it to take effect from 2019 onwards,” Economy Minister Ramon Escolano told a news conference in Sofia.\n“From the perspective of fairness and social justice, it doesn’t make sense that taxes should be leveled solely on the old economy,” he said.\nAsked whether a turnover tax was inconsistent with global practices, Angel Gurria, head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the body that coordinates tax policies among rich countries worldwide, said the issue should not be addressed hastily.\nGurria, who attended the EU meeting, said work for a global reform, which would include the United States, Japan and China, was already under way.\nHe said the OECD was ready to speed up its work, possibly advancing to next year the adoption of a blueprint that is currently due in 2020.\nAdditional reporting by Peter Maushagen in Sofia and Inmaculada Sanz in Barcelona; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Helen Popper\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about a European Commission plan to tax the digital turnover of large companies, which drew skepticism from the global rule-setting body on tax matters and some EU states.

Surya Subedi, professor of international law at Leeds University, said all the communities he had met raised the issue of misconduct by concession companies or their subcontractors, as did written submissions.\n\"In some cases the authorities have held the companies to account for their actions,\" Subedi said in a preliminary assessment after a recent eight-day visit. \"One example is the shooting incident at the TTY concession in Kratie province this year. However, in many cases, there remains impunity for violations committed by the companies.\"\nSubedi, who visited concession areas in the provinces of Ratanakiri, Kratie and Stung Treng, urged the Cambodian government to: act with more transparency when granting and managing economic and other land concessions; oversee companies involved with concessions more closely; and make the process more inclusive for affected individuals and communities.\nMore than 400,000 Cambodians have been affected by land \"grabs\" and evictions since 2003, according to the Cambodian league for the promotion and defence of human rights (Licadho), which works in 12 provinces across half the country. Last year there was a big increase in land disputes, the group said, with an additional 11,000 families affected.\nLand ownership was abolished under the communist reign of the Khmer Rouge (1974-79), leaving millions of Cambodians without title deeds and therefore vulnerable to domestic and foreign land grabs, as well as agriculture, mining and real estate projects.\nIn January, 300 families were dispersed without warning from the downtown slum of Borei Keila in the capital, Phnom Penh. Last year, the World Bank froze its loans to Cambodia over the forced removal of 10,000 residents of Boeung Kak lake, who were moved to build luxury flats and high-end shops for the development firm, Shukaku, owned by a senator from the ruling People's party.\nSubedi, voicing concern at the levels of protests linked to land disputes, called for dialogue. \"Some forms of protest, for example road blockages by communities, greatly impact on other individuals who have no involvement in the dispute,\" he said. \"People have a right to protest, but I urge all involved – communities, authorities and companies – to do their utmost to avoid violent protests. Dialogue is key.\"\nSubedi said he was struck by repeated calls for attention to be paid to environmental degradation caused by the alleged mismanagement of land under concession, unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, and the sheer size of forest cover affected by land concessions. He said the claims deserve immediate attention from the authorities.\nThe UN special rapporteur welcomed the decision to postpone the granting of new economic land concessions, announced by the Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen on 7 May, and called for a review of all existing concessions with a view to protecting the interests of communities.\n\"This is a good step in the right direction. As ever, the focus must be on the implementation of this new regulation,\" he said. \"It is clear that all Cambodians want to see economic development flourish, but this development should always be conducted in a sustainable manner, creating the least negative impact on communities as possible, whilst upholding the human rights of the individuals involved.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about land disputes in Cambodia, particularly related to companies' actions in seizing land, confiscating livestock, and destroying homes and property.

However, there remains impunity for violations committed by companies in many cases. Subedi called on the Cambodian government to act with more transparency when granting and managing economic and other land concessions, oversee companies involved more closely, and make the process more inclusive for affected individuals and communities. The news also highlights that over 400,000 Cambodians have been affected by land grabs and evictions since 2003, with an increase in land disputes reported in the past year.

{"num":58,"Time":"JANUARY 23, 2020","Title":"Central bank digital currencies: Moving towards reality?","Content":"By Tom Wilson\nLONDON (Reuters) - Central banks are looking at creating their own digital currencies - a stark contrast to the ethos of cryptocurrencies that seek to subvert mainstream authority over money.\nBitcoin (virtual currency) coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, France, May 27, 2015. British authorities have come out in support of digital currencies in the name of promoting financial innovation, while proposing that regulations should be drawn up to prevent their use in crime. But it is technophiles who are leading the drive to make London a real-world hub for trade in web-based \"cryptocurrencies\", of which bitcoin is the original and still most popular. Picture taken May 27, 2015. REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier\nAs Facebook’s efforts to launch its Libra cryptocurrency pour fuel onto debates over who will control money in the future, major economies have started to examine how so-called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could become reality.\nHere are some key questions on the rise of central bank digital currencies and their progress in entering the mainstream.\nARE CBDCs DIFFERENT TO CRYPTOCURRENCIES?\nYes - and fundamentally so.\nCBDCs are traditional money, but in digital form; issued and governed by a country’s central bank. By contrast, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are produced by solving complex maths puzzles, and governed by disparate online communities instead of a centralised body.\nThe common denominator is that both cryptocurrencies and CBDCs, to a varying degree, are based on blockchain technology, a digital ledger that allows transactions to be recorded and accessed in real time by multiple parties.\nWhile some retailers accept bitcoin as a form of payment, cryptocurrencies are not recognised as legal tender - which CBDCs, by definition, would be.\nAnd unlike central bank money, both traditional and digital, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined entirely by the market, and not influenced by factors such as monetary policy or trade surpluses.\nAND WHAT ABOUT ELECTRONIC CASH?\nThe rise of technology like contactless debit cards has made it easier for consumers and businesses to use electronic cash, or e-money, to pay for goods and services.\nBut this also differs to CBDCs.\nElectronic cash, defined by the Bank for International Settlements as a store of value for making payments to retailers or between devices, is usually held at banks or on pre-paid cards or digital wallets such as PayPal.\nCBDCs would not merely be a representation of physical money, as is the case with electronic cash, but a complete replacement for notes and coins.\nSO WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF CBDCs?\nCentral banks think CBDCs could make payments systems, which are often time-consuming and costly, more efficient, reducing transfer and settlement times and thus stoking economic growth.\nSome central banks think CBDCs could also counter the rise of cryptocurrencies issued by the private sector such as Libra, planned for launch in June 2020.\nBitcoin and other virtual currencies, hampered by wild volatility, have presented few realistic threats to central bank control over money. But central bankers fret that Libra could reach billions and quickly erode sovereignty over monetary policy.\nCBDCs, they think, could address problems like inefficient payments that cryptocurrencies seek to solve, while maintaining state control over money.\nIn an era of negative interest rates, CBDCs are also seen as offering a tool to encourage businesses and people to spend money and invest, the argument goes, as they could be used to charge households and businesses to hold cash.\nARE CBDCs CLOSE TO BECOMING REALITY?\nIncreasingly so - though most CBDC projects are still in very early or conceptual stages.\nA growing number of central banks are likely to issue their own digital currencies in the next few years, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has found. Most of those launching pilot schemes are from emerging markets. [L4N29R45W]\nAmong major economies, China is closest to becoming the first to introduce a CBDC. While details of its project to build a digital renminbi are scarce, it will be powered in part by blockchain technology and will initially be issued to commercial banks and other financial institutions.\nThe central banks of Britain, the euro zone, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland said on Tuesday they will share experiences in a group assisted by the BIS as they examine the case for issuing CBDCs.\nARE MOST MAJOR CENTRAL BANKS SUPPORTIVE?\nCaution and scepticism exists in many quarters.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, was notably absent from collaboration with the initiative by the European and Japanese central banks to look at CBDCs.\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell said in November the bank was monitoring the digital currency debate but not actively considering its own amid a host of legal, regulatory and operational questions.\nOthers, such as the Bank of Japan, have warned that uncertainties over the impact of CBDCs on commercial banking must be addressed. The BOJ has also scotched the idea that CBDCs could boost the effectiveness of negative interest rate policies.\nReporting by Tom Wilson; Editing by Pravin Char and Susan Fenton\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their progress in entering the mainstream.

{"num":61,"Time":"Tue 11 Apr 2023 08.00 CEST","Title":"‘Everywhere is broken’: how land grabs in Cambodia are demolishing lives","Content":"S\nitting on the veranda of a stilted house, a group of Cambodian fishers drink tea and sort crabs into buckets as they discuss when they might have to leave their homes. In 2020, Boeng Thom Angkep, a finger-shaped lake tucked below the forested hills of Ream national park on Cambodia’s south-western coast, was granted to an elite family to develop.\nAfter nearly two decades of peaceful existence, hundreds of lakeshore residents now face eviction. Weekly the authorities cross the rickety footbridges that link the stilt houses to the shore to take photos and warn that demolition could start at any time.\n“I don’t want to leave my home for even one day or they might come destroy it,” says 42-year-old Khun Dina. “We’re like small birds in a cage. They can smack us down whenever.”\nKhut Chantreal boards his fishing boat on Boeng Thom Angkep. The fishers’ homes and livelihoods are under threat from development\nTheirs is not an isolated situation. A wave of tourism and housing projects is transforming the coast of Preah Sihanouk province. Signs of development are everywhere: Along the curve of Ream Bay, trucks dump sand into the Gulf of Thailand for a multibillion-dollar megaproject called the Bay of Lights, 934 hectares (2,300 acres) to include luxury homes, a beach club, go-kart track, and a reverse bungee jump.\nA few kilometres north, excavators dig up a hillside where signs advertise a new gated community overlooking the bay. To the south, cranes loom over the edge of the national park where tourist resorts are being built.\nKnown for its seaside capital, Sihanoukville, and islands with white-sand beaches, the province drew international attention when a Chinese-fuelled casino boom started in 2013. By 2019, Sihanoukville’s streets were lined with hotels, casinos and restaurants and drew more visitors than Angkor Wat.\nSaracen Bay on the relatively undeveloped Koh Rong Sanloem\nA ban affecting gambling was announced in August 2019, and half the city’s casinos shut down. Together with the economic fallout from the Covid pandemic, Sihanoukville was left with empty buildings and abandoned construction projects.\nEven the surrounding countryside is dotted with half-finished projects and there were reports of criminal syndicates moving in with global cyberscam operations and human trafficking.\nNow the government is working on a new masterplan for Preah Sihanouk, wooing wealthy tourists and diversifying the once casino-heavy economy. Officials have been vague about the details, but the provincial deputy governor Long Dimanche explained in February that the goal was to make the province one of Cambodia’s main development hubs. “This economic stimulus and investment in the tourism industry is the starting point,” he said.\nBillboards advertising the Bay of Lights development, one of many large-scale projects in Preah Sihanouk province\nBut residents say they are paying the price, facing sudden evictions, seizure of farmland and the loss of prime fishing areas. They say authorities rarely explain land giveaways, which are frequently linked to well-connected people, according to more than a dozen interviews around the province.\nPhnom Penh-based human rights organisation Licadho has investigated the evictions of 787 Preah Sihanouk families between 2017 and 2022, a fraction of the true number, a spokesperson said.\nEverywhere is broken. They’re demolishing the resorts right in front of me, and we have no way to fight back\nSin Pisey, massage therapist\nOn the tourist island of Koh Rong Sanloem, piles of rubble, stacked-up mattresses and tangled electrical cords litter half of Saracen Bay beach after about 10 resorts and businesses were demolished in February. A few still stand daubed with red paint and eviction notices.\nWhen people began settling the island a decade ago, it had no electricity or running water. Even today, the island remains sleepy and idyllic beyond the string of beach bungalows and Khmer-style wooden resorts along Saracen Bay.\nSky Beach Resort on Koh Rong Sanloem is being demolished to make way for new developments\nTourists still arrive via speedboat daily, but many are shocked to see the destruction on the beach, says Sin Pisey, 35, who runs a massage therapy business. “Everywhere is broken,” says Pisey, who begged authorities to let her stay open another month.\n“It hurts me. They’re demolishing the resorts right in front of me, and we have no way to fight back.”\nSign up to Global Dispatch\nFree newsletter\nGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One man, whose business was demolished, says authorities warned him against speaking to the media. He believes the island is being ruined after watching excavators rip up the forest. “It’s all big roads, cutting down everything. They say they want to make the island look beautiful, but I don’t think so. They are too big. Too powerful.”\nIn August the government approved investment plans for 19 of Preah Sihanouk’s 32 islands. So far, Koh Rong Sanloem, the largest of the province’s islands, has been spared. Dimanche confirmed in February that one of the companies, Cambodia-registered Emario Shonan Marine Corporation, was going ahead with a project on Koh Rong Sanloem, but gave no details. Neither Dimanche nor another deputy governor responded to requests from the Guardian for comment; multiple calls to Emario Shonan were not returned.\nLand giveaways are accelerating across Cambodia, often favouring the elite. In Preah Sihanouk, at least 39 giveaways have privatised 3,802 hectares (nearly 15 square miles) since late 2018, according to Licadho. Family members of a senator, the prime minister’s daughters, and a tax department official are, says Licadho, among those who have benefited.\nNew roads now criss-cross the island of Koh Rong Sanloem to support the planned tourist developments\nIn many instances, people aren’t sure who or what to blame, just that the land was handed over as part of an oknha, an honorific title bestowed on those who give at least $500,000 to the government.\nOn the outskirts of Sihanoukville near Ream national park, Chan Mom, 37, is in her one-room home, twisting sausages on to skewers and raising her voice to be heard over the construction trucks barreling past. Last autumn, the farmland where she, and her father before her, grew cassava and pineapple, was revoked.\nShe heard rumours a resort might be built there under an oknha’s ownership, but the authorities gave her no explanation when they demanded that she tear down her shack and stop farming. “We don’t know what to do. We can’t get it back,” Mom says. She decided against protesting. Her husband adds: “Even if I’m strong, I’m just one person. They’ll arrest me.”\nAn aerial view shows the extent of an area being excavated for new building works in Ream commune, Preah Sihanouk province\nThere have been small protests. East of Sihanoukville in O’Okhna Heng, where a series of villages are clustered along the road leading to Phnom Penh, Chanthy* – who asked to go by a pseudonym – joined about 30 families at a protest in February over impending evictions.\nTen years ago Chanthy bought several plots of land above the road and received titles stamped by the local government. But people were called to a meeting in January and Chanthy’s husband returned with his hands shaking. He didn’t speak for days. “There’s no way for us to win,” he finally said: an estate agent, Everfortune Real Estate, was reclaiming the area saying their titles, sold through middlemen, were never valid.\nI can’t accept this. The land should belong to the people. Living in Cambodia is so hard\nKav Phor, smallholder\nNeither Everfortune Real Estate nor an O’Okhna Heng official responded to questions about the evictions.\nChanthy says that people had to flee bulldozers, leaving all their belongings behind. Her home is one of a few left at the top of the village. She owes $11,000 in microfinance loans for useless land titles. “If they come again, I will just stay inside the house and let them demolish us too,” she says. “No one can help this place.”\nKav Phor, who is refusing to comply with an eviction order from her home in Ream commune in Preah Sihanouk province\nNear Sihanoukville airport, 70-year-old Kav Phor is refusing to move from where she has been raising chickens and ducks since 1983. Years ago, Phor faced another land dispute and won her farm back by court order. “New year, new problem,” she says. She thinks the compensatory plot of land authorities offered is too close to another development project, meaning she could be evicted again.\nMass evictions at Angkor Wat leave 10,000 families facing uncertain future\nRead more\nShe has not left her shack for weeks, relying on her children to bring her supplies. “I can’t accept this,” Phor says. “Here, the land [should] belong to the people.

In recent days, however, the struggle has been to cool down a standoff on the ill-defined and disputed border with China.\nMore than 200 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army entered what India considers its territory last week and used cranes and bulldozers to build a 1.2-mile road, the Hindustan Times reported.\nIndian soldiers challenged the Chinese troops and asked them to withdraw, before demolishing a temporary track they had built, said the report, which has not been denied by Indian authorities.\nNews of the confrontation broke a day before the arrival of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, in India, and has undermined official statements vaunting the goodwill between the two nations.\nThough similar incidents occur regularly along the 2,200-mile border, this new faceoff underlines the persistent tensions between the two emerging powers – even if both currently appear eager to improve a patchy relationship.\nChina and India are keen to put a positive spin on Xi's first summit meeting with Narendra Modi, who won a landslide election victory to take power in Delhi in May.\nXi will start his visit in Gujarat, the western state that Modi ran for 12 years and which is seen as a showcase for his policies for the nation.\nThe two men are due to dine together with a handful of interpreters and selected aides in a specially constructed marquee erected on the newly refurbished riverfront in Gujarat's largest city, Ahmedabad.\nWang Dehua, director of South and Central Asian studies at the Shanghai Municipal Centre for International Studies, said the visit – the first by a Chinese head of state to India in eight years – was likely to focus on economic cooperation, including investments in transport infrastructure and the creation of industrial zones. \"Japan offered their express [bullet] trains to India. But I think Chinese express trains are more competitive,\" he said.\nIndia's economic growth has flagged in recent years, and few commentators now talk of catching up with their regional rivals. This week several have noted that from economic parity in 1980, China's growth has outstripped India's fourfold.\nOthers pointed out that since gaining independence from Britain in 1947 India has constructed 6,800 miles of railway track, while China added 8,700 miles in the five years to 2011.\nModi is an admirer of China. The 64-year-old Hindu nationalist politician has talked of turning Gujarat into \"India's Guangdong\". The state and the Chinese industrial powerhouse province are reportedly to be twinned formally this week.\n\"People have asked whether Modi is India's Deng Xiaoping,\" said Wang, referring to the Chinese leader who used Guangdong to pilot and power his country's economic transformation.\nChina is now India's largest trading partner and bilateral trade currently stands at $65bn (£40bn); the countries have set a target of $100bn by 2015. But Wang noted that India needed to close the rising deficit, which stood at $31bn last year.\nHe said Beijing was also interested in maritime and \"southern Silk Road\" connections, especially an economic corridor across China, Burma, India and Bangladesh.\nXi, who took power in 2012, arrives after touring the Maldives and Sri Lanka, two countries where growing Chinese influence has worried India. Delhi also has concerns about China's relationship with its hostile neighbour Pakistan and its growing role in Nepal.\nBeijing has been unsettled by Indian-US cooperation in the Asia Pacific region and Indian's stance on territorial disputes involving China and other nations in the South and East China Seas.\nModi's apparent rapport with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, during a heavily publicised recent visit to Tokyo and his plans to meet Barack Obama later this month point to a carefully balanced approach to India's relations with world powers.\nDiplomats in Delhi say Modi is likely to balance his interest in other bigger players who can help with the transformation of India that he envisages with security concerns and a sharp sense of popular sentiment.\n\"It's complicated. On the one hand China is a great opportunity for investment and trade but any Indian will tell you that the big existential threat to their country is not Pakistan but China. That's the only superpower in the neighbourhood and one with which they have already fought a war,\" one diplomat said.\nThat conflict, in 1962, ended in humiliating defeat for India. \"Let me assure you that our brave sentinels on the border will address any issue that happens on the border,\" said the foreign ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin. \"We are confident that our borders are in safe hands.\"\nHe said Modi and Xi would discuss the ongoing border dispute this week.\nThis article was amended on 18 September 2014 because an earlier version said Ahmedabad was Gujarat's capital.

The two countries have long been engaged in a row over the 1,000-year-old Hindu Preah Vihear temple in the Dângrêk mountains region, occasionally entering into armed conflict. A series of skirmishes in April 2011 left 18 people dead and thousands of villagers displaced. The area is currently the subject of a UN International Court of Justice probe to decide its future.\nNumbenchapol's decision to flag up two of the most contentious flashpoints in his country's recent history has not gone down well with the Thai authorities, however. On 23 April, the Thai ministry of culture announced a countrywide ban on the film, which premiered at the Berlin film festival in February.

But it was a key topic of Vietnamese-U.S. official talks in Hanoi, New York and Washington over the past month.\nWashington is considering structuring special financing terms for the pricey equipment that could help cash-strapped Hanoi steer away from its traditional reliance on lower-cost, Russian-made arms, according to the other source, who declined to be named.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nSpokespersons for the White House and Vietnamese foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\"We have a very productive and promising security relationship with the Vietnamese and we do see interesting movement from them in some U.S. systems, in particular anything that can help them better monitor their maritime domain, perhaps transport aircraft and some other platforms,\" said a U.S. official.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\"Part of what we're working on internally as the U.S. government is being creative about how we could try to provide better financing options to Vietnam to get them things that might be really useful to them.\"\nA major U.S.-Vietnam arms deal could aggravate China, Vietnam's larger neighbor, which is wary of Western efforts to box in Beijing. A long-simmering territorial dispute between Vietnam and China is heating up in the South China Sea and explains why Vietnam is looking to build up maritime defenses.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\"They are developing asymmetric defensive capabilities, but (want) to do so without triggering a response from China,\" said Jeffrey Ordaniel, associate professor of international security studies at Tokyo International University and director for maritime security at Pacific Forum International, a think tank. \"It is a delicate balancing act.\"\nOrdaniel said Washington should shift funds set aside for financing militaries in the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific region \"so partners like Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan can afford the weapons they need to resist Beijing.\"\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nThe Biden administration has said it is trying to balance geopolitical competition with China, including in the Pacific, and responsibly managing the two superpowers' relationship.\nEarlier this month, Vietnam upgraded Washington to Hanoi's highest diplomatic status, alongside China and Russia, when U.S. President Joe Biden visited the country.\nThe diplomatic turnaround marks a sharp pivot nearly a half-century after the end of the Vietnam War.\nSince an arms embargo was lifted in 2016, U.S. defense exports to Vietnam have been limited to coast guard ships and trainer aircraft, while Russia has supplied about 80% of the country's arsenal.\nVietnam spends an estimated $2 billion annually in arms imports, and Washington is optimistic that they can shift a share of that budget over the long term to weapons from the United States or its allies and partners, especially South Korea and India.\nThe cost of U.S. weaponry is a major obstacle, as is training on the equipment, and is among the reasons the country has taken in less than $400 million of American arms over the past decade.\n\"Vietnamese officials are well aware that they need to spread the wealth,\" the U.S. official said. \"We need to lead the charge in helping Vietnam get what it needs.\"\nMeanwhile, the war in Ukraine has complicated Hanoi's longstanding relationship with Moscow, making supplies and spare parts for Russian-made arms harder to acquire.

Fraud is rampant and disputes over titles often end up in court.\nPutting India’s land records on blockchain - the technology behind the bitcoin currency - would greatly increase efficiency and reduce fraud, analysts say.\n“The land registry is a good candidate for blockchain as there is no way to verify titles quickly,” said Vishal Batra at IBM Research, who works on the technology.\n“The process lends itself to fraud, as an owner can re-sell a property, and the buyer is ignorant. With blockchain there would be savings and efficiency, and there can be no fraud.”\nThe blockchain technology works by creating permanent, public “ledgers” of all transactions, potentially replacing a mass of overlapping records with one simple database.\nOnce a land record or real estate transactions is on blockchain, all the parties involved -- banks, government, brokers, buyers and sellers -- can track the deal.\nCountries across the world - from Sweden to Dubai, Georgia to Britain - are beginning to embrace or test the technology in their national property records.\nOfficial said the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are in talks to put land records on blockchain.\n“We are already digitising all land records, so this can be the next step,” J.A. Chowdary, technology advisor to the Andhra Pradesh government, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nDistortion to India’s land markets is a barrier to faster growth, accounting for 1.3 percent of lost gross domestic product growth every year, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the global consulting firm.\nLitigation is common. Matters related to land and property make up about two thirds of all civil cases in the country, according to a study released last year.\nBut while digitisation is needed, technology alone cannot solve all matters related to land, said Sunil Kumar, director of land laws and policy at advocacy group Landesa.\n“What if the data is incorrectly captured? To get a clean record, you need clean inputs,” he said.\n“For that you need community involvement, particularly in rural areas, to verify ownership and resolve disputes.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the JSON format response based on the provided news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"Indian states, particularly Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, are exploring the use of blockchain technology to digitize land deals.

{"num":82,"Time":"Updated 6:39 AM EDT, Fri May 12, 2023","Title":"Former NBA star Dwight Howard sparks backlash in China after calling Taiwan a ‘country’","Content":"CNN\n — \nFormer NBA player Dwight Howard has become the latest international sports star to be caught in the crosshairs of Chinese nationalist wrath after he referred to Taiwan as a “country” in a promotional video alongside the democratic island’s vice president.\nThe 37-year-old eight-time NBA All-Star has enjoyed huge popularity in Taiwan since joining its professional team Taoyuan Leopards from the Los Angeles Lakers in November last year.\n“Since I came to Taiwan, I’ve gained a whole new appreciation of this country. This place makes me feel so much love,” Howard said in a two-minute online video.\nTaiwan is a self-ruled democracy with its own military, currency, constitution and elected government, although it is not officially recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world.\nChina’s ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it, and has refused to rule out the use of force to “unify” the island with mainland China.\nThe Taiwan issue is a central piece to Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s vision of “national rejuvenation,” a nationalistic agenda that has stoked cross-strait tensions to their highest in decades.\nUnder growing economic, diplomatic and military pressure from China, Taiwan has sought to promote its robust democratic system and free and open society to win friends internationally.\nThe video, released Wednesday, is part of the island’s promotional campaign to invite foreign tourists to spend a night at the Presidential Office Building in Taipei.\nHoward appeared in the video alongside Taiwan Vice President William Lai, who has been nominated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party as its candidate for the presidential election next year.\nWhen Lai told Howard international travelers can enjoy an overnight stay with breakfast at the Presidential Office Building, the basketball star exclaimed: “That is crazy! I don’t even know that’s legal in my country or not.”\n“That’s why Taiwan is a free country,” Lai replied.\n“OK! I like it,” Howard said.\nFormer NBA star Dwight Howard shoots a promotional video for Taiwan with the democratic island's Vice President William Lai.\nThe video sparked immediate furor in China after it was reposted on Chinese social media.\nOn Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform, users accused Howard of supporting Taiwan independence and demanded an apology from him.\nThe hashtag “Howard Taiwan independence” became the top trending topic on Weibo on Friday morning, and garnered more than 400 million views by the afternoon.\nMeanwhile, censors have quietly taken down the full video, in which Howard heaped praise on Taiwan for its hospitality, “great and friendly living environment” and “great diverse culture.”\nIt also showed the interior of the Presidential Office Building, a large suite for the overnight stay, and tourists posing for photos with Taiwan’s military honor guards.\nZhongnanhai, an imperial garden in central Beijing that serves as the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party, is strictly off the limits to tourists for visits, let alone an overnight stay.\nAmid growing anger, Howard on Friday described his use of the word “country” as a “communication barrier.”\n“Where I’m from if I say I wanna go to the country, it doesn’t not mean that place is a country. It’s just how we talk,” he told Taiwanese reporters during an event in Yilan county.\n“If I offended anyone in China I apologize. It was not my intention to harm anyone with what I said in the commercial,” he said.\n“I am not a politician. I don’t want to get involved in any politics… I have the utmost respect for Chinese people and utmost respect for Taiwanese people, so it was never my intent to disrespect nobody.”\nHoward’s team did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\nUnder Washington’s longstanding “one China” policy, the US acknowledges Beijing’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized the Chinese Communist Party’s claim to the democratic island of more than 23 million. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, Washington is also bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\nIn a statement to CNN, Taiwan’s Presidential Spokesperson Kolas Yotaka said it was “sad” to see some Chinese internet users “have their hearts broken.”\n“We do not intend to break their hearts. We welcome them to stay in Taiwan for a few nights. If you know more about Taiwan, you will know why politicians, athletes, tourists, and entrepreneurs from all over the world like to come to our country,” she said.\nThis is not the first time figures linked to the NBA have sparked controversy in China, where it is among the most popular international sports leagues.\nThe NBA is caught once again between free speech and the lucrative Chinese market\nIn 2021, Enes Kanter, center for the Boston Celtics, called Chinese leader Xi Jinping a “brutal dictator” over China’s treatment of Tibet, sparking an immediate backlash.\nTwo years earlier then-Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey set off a firestorm when he tweeted his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\nSoon after, the NBA’s Chinese partners suspended ties, state broadcaster CCTV halted all broadcasts of preseason matches, and the Chinese government said the NBA needed to show “mutual respect.”\nMorey apologized and deleted the tweet, and the NBA said his comments were “regrettable” — prompting outrage from fans in the United States and Hong Kong, who accused the league of censorship and bowing to Beijing’s pressure.\nInternational brands and businesses have also found themselves the targets of vocal consumer boycotts on the mainland if they are seen to describe Taiwan as being separate or sovereign.\nIn 2021, Hollywood star John Cena had to profess his love for China after calling Taiwan a “country” during an interview promoting a film that generated a backlash among Chinese fans.\nTaiwan first began allowing visitors to stay at the Presidential Office Building complex in 2019, when it attracted 167 applications from 33 countries.\nThe campaign, organized by the General Association of Chinese Culture (GACC), a non-government organization in Taiwan, was restarted this year after being suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIt allows a maximum of 20 foreign visitors to spend one night in the complex free of charge, but they are required to turn their experience into social media videos to promote tourism in Taiwan, according to the island’s Central News Agency.\nResponding to the outrage in China against the promotional video, GACC Secretary-General Lee Hou-ching said: “Taiwan is a democratic, pluralistic, friendly country with freedom of speech. We are used to having different voices in our daily lives and respect everyone’s right to speak.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"Former NBA star Dwight Howard sparked backlash in China after referring to Taiwan as a 'country' in a promotional video.

It found there could be a drop of up to 70% in crop yields in the most vulnerable areas of the Sahel, an ecologically fragile belt stretching from Senegal to Sudan. \"It illustrates and demonstrates what is increasingly becoming a global concern,\" said Achim Steiner, UNEP's executive director. \"It doesn't take a genius to work out that as the desert moves southwards there is a physical limit to what [ecological] systems can sustain, and so you get one group displacing another.\"\nHe also pointed to incipient conflicts in Chad \"at least in part associated with environmental changes\", and to growing tensions in southern Africa fuelled by droughts and flooding.\nEstimates of the dead from the Darfur conflict, which broke out in 2003, range from 200,000 to 500,000. The immediate cause was a regional rebellion, to which Khartoum responded by recruiting Arab militias, the janjaweed, to wage a campaign of ethnic cleansing against African civilians. The UNEP study suggests the true genesis of the conflict pre-dates 2003 and is to be found in failing rains and creeping desertification. It found that:\n· The desert in northern Sudan has advanced southwards by 60 miles over the past 40 years;\n· Rainfall has dropped by 16%-30%;\n· Climate models for the region suggest a rise of between 0.5C and 1.5C between 2030 and 2060;\n· Yields in the local staple, sorghum, could drop by 70%.\nIn the Washington Post, the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, argued: \"Almost invariably, we discuss Darfur in a convenient military and political shorthand - an ethnic conflict pitting Arab militias against black rebels and farmers. Look to its roots, though, and you discover a more complex dynamic. Amid the diverse social and political causes, the Darfur conflict began as an ecological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change.\"\nIn turn, the Darfur conflict has exacerbated Sudan's environmental degradation, forcing more than two million people into refugee camps. Deforestation has been accelerated while underground aquifers are being drained.\nA peace deal signed last year by rebels and the Khartoum government broke down, but this month President Omar al-Bashir said he would accept the deployment of a joint UN and African Union force. He has reneged on similar pledges, but UN diplomats are hopeful this one will stick. However, the UNEP report warns that no peace will last without sustained investment in containing environmental damage and adapting to climate change. Mr Steiner said: \"Simply to return people to the situation there were in before is a high-risk strategy.\"\nThe G8 summit ended in Germany with consensus over the severity of the climate change problem but no agreement on how it should be contained.

{"num":89,"Time":"Tue 25 Sep 2012 16.20 CEST","Title":"Conflict over land in Cambodia is taking a dangerous turn","Content":"In the first nine months of the year, we have seen the killing of Cambodia's leading environmental activist, a journalist and a 14-year-old girl whose community faced eviction. We've also seen the conviction of 13 land activists for legitimate protests; a judicial move against one of the country's most respected human rights activists; the harassment of politically active monks; and the arrest of an independent radio station owner on charges of secessionism. And these are just the most outlandish and publicised incidents.\nAs disparate as these cases may seem, there is a common thread that runs through each of them: conflict over natural resources.\nCambodia is in the grip of a land-grabbing crisis that has seen more than 2m hectares (5m acres) of land transferred mostly from subsistence farmers to agribusiness. And as good land becomes scarce, the battle for it is becoming increasingly intense. An estimated 400,000 people have been affected by land disputes since 2003.\nThis massive transfer of natural resources has been accomplished mostly through Cambodia's economic land concession (ELC) scheme, in which the government leases large plots of land to companies that agree to farm them. Those evicted to make way for superfarms are entitled to compensation, but rarely get it. Cambodia's land title system is in shambles, and poor farmers rarely hold deeds for their land – even if they are legally entitled to them, based on possession rights.\nEven a so-called moratorium on new ELCs in May has failed to stem the tide. International donors and civil society groups have long pushed for a ban, but since the moratorium, news of at least another 12 concessions, totalling more than 80,000 hectares, has emerged.\nThe moratorium contains a little-noticed loophole – one so big that it swallows the ban itself. It allows the government to award ELCs that were \"agreed in principle\" prior to May. Of course, there is no public list of the ELCs \"agreed in principle\", so we simply have to take the government's word for it.\nIn other words, it's business as usual – there's just a new gloss to distract confused foreign donors.\nThe driving force behind Cambodia's land crisis may be shortsighted greed, but its legacy could be long-term social and environmental catastrophe. The land grab is creating an underclass of landless citizens who have no stake in society and nothing left to lose.\nRecourse to the law is not an option. In fact, the law is often used against victims of land grabs, as in the case of the 13 women activists of the Boeung Kak lake community. They were arrested and convicted in May after taking part in a peaceful demonstration over a land dispute land dispute that led to the forcible eviction of more than 3,500 families. The women were released in June after international outcry, but three months later, two more land activists – including another Boeung Kak community leader – were arrested.\nFor the average Cambodian, the only avenues that offer the prospect of success are public protest and individual action. The government is well aware of the desperation, and this fact helps explain the recent spate of arrests, killings and harassment. The authorities are increasingly using violence to keep a lid on things. If evictees don't go peacefully, private firms are willing and able to tap the resources of the state to forcefully capture land.\nThe violence and arrests are symptoms of an accelerating breakdown in Cambodian society. People need outlets for complaint. They need recourse and accountability. Cambodia increasingly has neither. Pressure is building and the system is having difficulty keeping discontent bottled up.\nOn Wednesday, officials will gather for a major conference in Phnom Penh between the Cambodian government and aid partners. At the last conference, in 2010, donors pledged $1.1bn in assistance – half of Cambodia's national budget. This year presents an opportunity for donor governments to take action to ensure Cambodia addresses the root causes of this breakdown – from the culture of impunity and corruption to the lack of a proper system of land titles.\nThe first step would be to call for the loophole in the ELC moratorium to be closed – before more Cambodians are marginalised and it becomes too late. Only when this is done can the country begin its long journey towards transparency and fairness in land rights.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to land conflicts in Cambodia, which involve disputes over natural resources and land grabbing.

Building the micro-tunnel could cost as much C$86 million ($63.64 million), the corporation added.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nEarlier this year, TMC estimated the entire expansion project would cost C$30.9 billion, more than four times its original budget, and warned the price tag could rise further.\nConcerns about TMX being delayed have already started weighing on Canadian crude prices, as traders worry rising oil sands production could get bottlenecked in Canada.\nThe dispute will also likely complicate the Canadian government's plan to sell the pipeline once construction is finished. Trans Mountain was bought by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government from Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) in 2018 to ensure it got built.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\"It truly is a nightmare come true for the Canadian government,\" said Morningstar analyst Stephen Ellis. \"The response of the SSN First Nation seems quite compelling and detailed, and lays out Trans Mountain's shortfalls in a very clear fashion.\"\nIn letters already filed with regulators, the Indigenous group says altering the route would disturb lands that hold \"profound spiritual and cultural significance\", and it only agreed to allow TMX to cross its territory in the first place because of assurances the micro-tunneling would work.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\"Any support or consent that SSN has provided for the Project has been based on conditions that explicitly protect the Pípsell (Jacko Lake) Corridor from disturbance or harm,\" the SSN said in an August filing.\nEllis said it seemed likely the expansion project would be delayed even if regulators grant TMC's request, echoing a letter filed last week by Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO), a major shipper on the pipeline.\nThe CER will hear arguments and cross-examinations from both the SSN First Nation and TMC over two days in Calgary, and extend the hearing to a third day if required.\nA CER spokeswoman said regulators will issue a decision as soon as possible after considering all the evidence, and recognized the time sensitivities associated with hearing.\n($1 = 1.3548 Canadian dollars)\n(This story has been refiled to correct a typo in the headline)\nReporting by Nia Williams Editing by Aurora Ellis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAcquire Licensing Rights\n, opens new tab","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the JSON format response based on the provided news article:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": {\n        \"Title\": \"Canada's Trans Mountain oil pipeline faces hearing on route change dispute\",\n        \"Summary\": \"Canadian regulators are conducting a two-day hearing to assess a route change request from the Trans Mountain expansion (TMX) project.

Here’s why it matters for the world","Content":"Hong Kong\nCNN\n — \nMaritime disputes across the vast South China Sea have ratcheted up in recent years as an increasingly assertive China militarizes disputed islands and confronts its regional rivals over their competing claims in the strategically important and resource-rich waterway.\nBracketed by China and several Southeast Asian nations, parts of the vital economic passage are claimed by multiple governments, with Beijing asserting ownership over almost all of the waterway in defiance of an international court ruling.\nOver the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports.\nCompeting claimants, such as the Philippines, say such actions infringe on their sovereignty and violate maritime law.\nAnd the United States agrees, regularly sending its Navy destroyers on freedom of navigation operations close to contested islands, leading to fears that the South China Sea could become a flashpoint between the two superpowers.\nHere’s what you should know.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nWhy it matters who owns the seas (April 2021)\n03:48 - Source: CNN\nWhy does the South China Sea matter?\nThe 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year.\nIt’s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend.\nMuch of its economic value remains untapped, however. According to the US Energy Information Agency, the waterway holds at least 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 11 billion barrels of oil.\nWho controls those resources and how they are exploited could have a huge impact on the environment. The South China Sea is home to hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls and diverse wildlife at risk from climate change and marine pollution.\nWho claims what?\nBeijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims.\nIn 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.\nChina has ignored the ruling: Manila says Beijing continues to send its maritime militia to Mischief Reef and Scarborough Shoal in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.\nIn the southern portion of the sea is the Spratly Island chain, which Beijing calls the Nansha islands. The archipelago consists of 100 islets and reefs of which 45 are occupied by China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam or the Philippines.\nIn the northwestern part of the sea, the Paracels – known as the Xisha islands in China – have been controlled by Beijing since 1974 despite claims from Vietnam and Taiwan.\nChina’s ruling Communist Party also claims self-governing Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it.\nWhat does China’s naval build up mean for the sea?\nChina has built the world’s largest naval fleet, more than 340 warships, and until recently it has been regarded as a green-water navy, operating mostly near the country’s shores.\nBut Beijing’s shipbuilding reveals blue-water ambitions. In recent years it has launched large guided-missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers with the ability to operate in the open ocean and project power thousands of miles from Beijing.\nIn addition, Western marine security experts – along with the Philippines and the United States – claim China controls a maritime militia that is hundreds of vessels strong and acts as an unofficial – and officially deniable – force that Beijing uses to push its territorial claims both in the South China Sea and beyond.\n'Little blue men': Is a militia Beijing says doesn't exist causing trouble in the South China Sea?\nThe US is not a claimant to the South China Sea, but says the waters are crucial to its national interest of guaranteeing freedom of the seas worldwide.\nThe US Navy regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea, saying the US is “defending every nation’s right to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.”\nBeijing denounces such operations as illegal.\nWhat has China built in the sea?\nMost of Beijing’s military buildup is concentrated along the Spratly and Paracel island chains, where sustained land reclamation saw reefs being destroyed first and then built on.\nChinese vessels have been known to encircle various atolls and islets, sending dredgers to build artificial islands large enough to harbor tankers and warships.\n“Over the past decade, the PRC has added more than 3,200 acres of land to its seven occupied outposts in the Spratly Islands, which now feature airfields, berthing areas, and resupply facilities to support persistent PRC military and paramilitary presence in the region,” US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Lindsey Ford told a House subcommittee earlier this week, referring to China by its official acronym, the People’s Republic of China.\nBeijing’s military construction sped up in 2014 as it quietly began massive dredging operations on seven reefs in the Spratlys.\nPhilippines accuses Chinese vessels of 'dangerous maneuvers' in disputed South China Sea\nSince then, Beijing has constructed military bases on Subi Reef, Johnson Reef, Mischief Reef and Fiery Cross Reef, fortifying its claims on the chain, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nThose facilities, according to Ford, are now bristling with some of China’s most advanced weaponry, including stealth fighters.\n“Since early 2018, we have seen the PRC steadily equip its Spratly Island outposts — including Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, and Fiery Cross — with an increasing array of military capabilities, including advanced anti-ship cruise missiles, long-range surface-to-air missile systems, J-20 stealth fighter jets, laser and jamming equipment, and military radar and signals intelligence capabilities,” she said in a prepared statement.\nChina installed exploratory oil rigs in the Paracels in 2014 that sparked anti-China riots in Vietnam, a competing claimant.\nMore recently, cruise ships have taken Chinese tourists to the militarized reefs.\nSatellite image of Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands group captured on March 29, 2009.\nA runway and military installations built on Fiery Cross Reef as of August 15, 2018.\nWhy are tensions rising again?\nUnder President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, the Philippines has taken increasingly assertive steps to protect its claim to shoals in the South China Sea, leading to several confrontations with Chinese vessels in waters off the Philippine islands.\nThey include standoffs between Chinese coast guard and what Manila says are shadowy Chinese maritime militia boats and tiny wooden Philippine fishing vessels; Chinese water cannons blocking the resupply of a shipwrecked Philippine military outpost; and a lone Filipino diver using a knife to sever a massive floating Chinese barrier.\n“These recent incidents in the past year shows that China has become increasingly aggressive and confident in its actions against smaller countries like the Philippines. They’re beginning to cross certain lines,” said Jay Batongbacal, a maritime expert at the University of the Philippines.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard says it remains “committed to upholding international law, safeguarding the welfare of Filipino fisherfolk, and protecting the rights of the Philippines in its territorial waters.”\nChina’s Foreign Ministry has defended the behavior of its vessels in the waterway and said Beijing will “firmly safeguard” what it views as its territorial sovereignty.\nWhat are the global implications?\nSince taking office in 2022, Philippine President Marcos Jr. has taken a stronger stance over the South China Sea than his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, amid the wider power struggle that has been playing out in the region for years.\nThe South China Sea is widely seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflict, and the recent confrontations between Manila and Beijing have raised concerns among Western observers of potentially developing into an international incident if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines, a US treaty ally.\nWashington and Manila are bound by a mutual defense treaty signed in 1951 that remains in force, stipulating that both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.\nMarcos has strengthened US relations that had frayed under his predecessor, with the two allies touting potential future joint patrols in the South China Sea.\nAs the partners held their largest military exercise in April 2023, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned that US-Philippine military cooperation “must not interfere in South China Sea disputes.”\nThe US, however, has condemned China’s recent actions in the contested sea and threatened to intervene under its mutual defense treaty obligations if Philippine vessels came under armed attack there.\n“The increasingly frequent run-ins between China and the Philippines speak to the new Marcos government’s willingness to stand up to Chinese bullying and coercion,” said Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.\n“Part of that is certainly attributable to the closer US-Philippines alliance which helps given Manila the confidence that Beijing will be deterred from overt military force lest it invoke the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty.”\nCNN’s Helen Regan and Brad Lendon contributed reporting.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to digital territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

Investors also risk domestic legal challenges, prosecution in international courts for human rights abuses, protests by communities and public outcry, which can harm companies' ability to do business elsewhere, it says.\nAndy White, co-ordinator of the RRI, said conflicts over land deals are not inevitable, but investors need to appreciate that ignoring the interests of local communities is risky business.\n\"Natural resource developers and their investors face a major challenge. Their profits – along with their ability to meet global demand – can plummet if the situation on the ground becomes unstable,\" he said. \"Investors need to understand that in this day and age, no land is empty. The people living on the land need to be identified, involved and respected. They are striving for a better life; economic development should not bring them harsher poverty instead.\"\nThe paper, \"Global capital, local concessions: A data-driven examination of land tenure risk and emerging market concessions, examined land deals for agriculture, forestry and mining projects in Argentina, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Liberia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mozambique, Peru and the Philippines.\nResearchers mapped and analysed geospatial data on deals covering more than 153m hectares, finding 3,750 cases in where there is significant overlap with local community lands.\nIn the most extreme case, researchers found that 84% of soybean concessions in Argentina overlapped with land claimed by communities.\nIn Cameroon, the data suggests that 83% of all commercial timber concessions overlapped with community forests.\nMeanwhile, In Chile, Colombia and the Philippines, 30% of the area covered by mining concessions appear to overlap with indigenous territory. In the Philippines, disputes over the Tampakan copper-gold mine have placed $5.9bn-worth of investment at risk in a project that is projected to add 1% to national GDP, the paper says.\nThe authors note, however, that not all governments have made the same effort to map and demarcate community and indigenous lands.\n\"There has been little political or economic incentive for governments to map local populations' land and resource claims, whereas the incentive to map concessions is obvious,\" says the paper, which warns that the actual extent of overlapping land claims is likely much larger than available data suggests.\nThe lack of data also means it is difficult, if not impossible, for investors to insure against the risk of conflicts with local communities, it says.\nBryson Ogden, private sector analyst at the RRI, said companies should take matters into their own hands, go into the field and engage communities in mapping exercises to identify potentially competing claims over land. They should also recognise that legal rights are not always implemented, and come up with operational policies to engage with communities and diffuse conflicts before they erupt, he said.\n\"There needs to be a change in how folks are engaging with communities and dealing with the risk of conflict,\" said Ogden. \"At the end of the day, the world needs resources and people want economic development but this needs to happen in a sustainable manner.\"\nThe paper was published to coincide with an international conference on community land rights in Interlaken, Switzerland, where a diverse set of conservationists, land rights activists and companies are meeting to discuss how to deal with disputes.\nIt follows a report from First Peoples Worldwide, which found that more than 30% of the oil and gas produced by companies listed on the Russell 1000 stock market index is sourced either on or near indigenous people's lands.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses the risk faced by developers and investors in developing countries regarding potential land conflicts with local communities and indigenous territories.

{"num":2,"Time":"Thu 19 Apr 2007 11.29 CEST","Title":"Bad maps are key factor in farming fiasco","Content":"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday April 26 2007\nIn the article below, we said that maps printed from the Land Register were sent to farmers claiming subsidies and that many of these were inaccurate. The Land Register referred to is the Rural Land Register held by the Rural Payments Agency, not the Land Registry's Land Register.\nOne accusation we face at Technology Guardian's Free Our Data campaign is that public sector information is a minority interest. Why should any normal person, let alone a busy government minister, be interested in subjects like free access to geospatial information?\nA simmering political row over a fiasco that cost English farmers £20m and a senior civil servant his job may move the issue up the agenda. The National Farmers' Union said this week that geographical information was a key factor in the latest fiasco involving government IT to hit the headlines: the disastrous attempt to introduce new \"single payment\" European Union subsidies for farmers in England. The scheme entitles anyone keeping certain classes of land in good agricultural condition to apply for payments based solely on area.\nIn implementing the reforms, senior executives at the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) and its Rural Payments Agency ordered most ingredients in the recipe for a government IT disaster.\nInvestigations by the National Audit Office and the House of Commons rural affairs committee found that implementation was rushed, partly for political reasons, and reforms were introduced at the same time as a £130m \"change programme\" involving cutting the Rural Payment Agency's staff numbers by half.\nThe agency's confidence was based on its appointment of a high-profile director of information systems on a salary of £225,000, and the contracting of a leading IT services firm, Accenture, to supply the claim processing system.\nSheer volume\nAccenture executives told subsequent investigations that the IT worked as specified. But the system could not cope with the volume of inquiries from farmers - at least 10 times greater than expected. One reason was that, unlike in countries such as Germany, there was no minimum payout. The agency had to handle 14,000 claims for less than €100 each.\nHowever the biggest reason for the overwhelming traffic was to do with mapping. The system set the minimum size of a parcel of land as 0.1 hectare, three times smaller than that permitted by the European Union. In all, there were 1.7m parcels of land on more than 75,000 farms. Calculating payments on these parcels required a sophisticated mapping system, involving digitised satellite images and aerial photography aligned up with conventional mapping data. The geographical data came from private sources, including the specialist firm Infoterra, as well as the state-owned Ordnance Survey.\nMaps printed from the Land Register were sent to every farmer claiming subsidy to check. According to Julie Robinson, a lawyer with the National Farmers' Union, this is where the system went wrong. \"Many of the maps sent back to farmers to check turned out to be seriously inaccurate.\" The maps missed land lost to floods, hedges and shadows from lines of trees. \"It is all at the mercy of accurate mapping. The farmer depends on them to get it right.\" The main problem, she says, was that the system was not matched to the needs of the users.\nThe Agriculture Committee agreed that the agency \"was working to an unnecessarily high level of accuracy, which caused inconsistencies in the maps at boundaries\".\nThe single payment fiasco cost farmers about £20m, the agency's chief executive his job and began a top level political row which rumbles on, not least because the minister responsible, Margaret Beckett, was promoted to foreign secretary.\nComplex mess\nCould free mapping data have prevented the disaster? Probably not - mapping was only one factor in a complex mess of policy and management failures. But the fact that Defra was allowed to commission its own geographical database to an unworkably high specification suggests flaws in the government's current way of working.\nThere are two opportunities for change. One is a new geographical information strategy for the UK, now before ministers and expected to be published this summer. The second is the process of implementing the European Inspire directive, to create a \"geospatial data infrastructure\" across Europe. The lead department in transposing this directive into UK law is Defra. We suggest that when implementing Inspire it errs on the side of openness.\nFreely available mapping data might not have prevented the rural payments fiasco - but it would have given all parties more warning that it was coming.\n· Join the debate at the Free Our Data blog: freeourdata.org.uk\/blog\n· If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about Geographic Information Systems (GIS) inaccuracies in the context of a farming fiasco in England.

Sometimes, they only refer to the country a device is in and, in some cases, even that information can be inaccurate.\nFusion said Ms Taylor's troubles were the results of IP mapping by MaxMind, which chose her property as the default spot for IPs it could not locate more precisely other than saying they were in the USA.

That means there is no human intervention to double check if the readings are anomalous or the predictions unrealistic.\nHeather Shepherd, of the National Flood Forum, which advocates for communities at risk of flooding and maintains a network of local groups, said the automated system had led to a number of false alarms.\nShe described how in January warnings were issued around the River Severn predicting the worst flooding in recent memory, prompting her to spend two days preparing for disaster.\n“Everybody was on high level prep. And, of course, do you know what? We didn’t even flood,” Shepherd said. “Nothing, nothing at all. Not a drop. It didn’t even come. I was up all through the night, walking down to look into the yard, to see in the street, see where it was, [and] nothing.”\nSign up to Down to Earth\nFree weekly newsletter\nThe planet's most important stories.

But on 14 January, residents living near the River Wye in Herefordshire received a flood alert – the lowest level of warning – that came 24 hours after the highest peak in water levels for three years.\nOne resident of that area who emailed the Guardian described how that alert came after his home was already flooded.\nTrade unions representing Environment Agency workers criticised the plans to increase automation of the flood warning system, which they said they had not been consulted on. Ben Middleton, national secretary at Prospect, said: “As one of the unions representing staff at The Environment Agency, we do not believe this will be an effective way of warning the public about potential floods.\n“Without human review, warnings may be issued unnecessarily and cause undue alarm if faulty readings are given by the equipment. Automated systems may also fail to recognise fast-developing problems, which an expert staff member with experience of a particular area would be able to spot. To be effective, automation relies upon properly trained staff to service and maintain the equipment and to analyse and interpret warning triggers.”\nDonna Rowe Merriman, head of environment at Unison, said: “Human judgment is irreplaceable when it comes to serious environmental issues. Dealing with deep staff shortages and resolving strikes must be the agency’s priorities, not relying on a flimsy and faulty automated system.\n“The bottom line is that employees are underpaid and leaving en masse, meaning services aren’t operating safely. Without a pay boost to stop the staff exodus, there’s a serious risk of irreversible damage to rivers, coasts, properties and whole communities.”\nAn Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We are committed to improving the accuracy of the automated flood warning system and have taken on board feedback from the public when doing this.\n“The automation of flood warnings has been developed as a mitigation for ongoing periods of industrial action to ensure that community members continue to receive timely information about their flood risk. We will review its use at a later date to determine whether it could contribute to our future flood warning service.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses England's automated flood warning system, which is relied upon by many households.

{"num":15,"Time":"Thu 29 Nov 2012 23.04 CET","Title":"Leveson on science reporting","Content":"Lord Justice Leveson's 2000-page 'B.F.R.' contains a number of references to science reporting, with a particular emphasis on accuracy. Fiona Fox, a press officer who directs the Science Media Centre, clearly made a strong impression and is cited on numerous occasions. On page 22, Leveson accepts her view that \"misleading and inaccurate reporting\" of scientific issues \"were… not covered by the complaints system,\" and on page 80 he rightly makes the point that in specialist journalism \"most non-specialist readers cannot easily judge for themselves what experts are telling us.\" In other words: it is easy to mislead readers about science, and there are no real safeguards to stop it from happening.\nAll of the organizations who gave evidence to the Inquiry about science reporting cited the MMR debacle as \"an example of how journalism that they allege was both inaccurate and unbalanced led to a media generated health scare.\" This seems to have weighed on Leveson's mind, and he accepts that bad reporting on the MMR vaccines had \"a widespread and harmful impact.\" In other words, the Inquiry appears to agree that fear-mongering journalists in publications like the Mail and Private Eye screwed up so badly that it impacted public health; something which makes you wonder why it took phone-hacking to make this inquiry happen.\nSince \"the press is regarded as a reliable and responsible source of information,\" Leveson believes that it should accurately reflect the balance and quality of evidence available. \"This is not to accord undue weight to the views of the scientific and medical establishment; rather, it is to accord due recognition to the strength of the available evidence to ensure that the position is not misrepresented.\" Later (page 691), he quotes Fiona Fox extensively on the issue of false balance:\nThe media often has a tendency to pursue balance in its stories, by countering one claim with another, and allowing alternative viewpoints a right of reply. [...] In science, it is often the case that a mainstream opinion about the interpretation of known data is shared overwhelmingly by professionals in that field, for example with the safety of the MMR vaccine or the link between greenhouse gases and global warming. When this is the case, the effect of balancing opinion to stoke debate can be to create a misleading impression that dissent from the mainstream view is more widespread and serious than it actually is.\nIn spite of this, and a fun demolition job on some of some of MailOnline editor Martin Clarke's attempts to defend examples of dodgy health reporting there that I'll let you seek out for yourselves, Leveson was at great pains to praise the industry's coverage of science. Professor Brian Cox was noted as a particular highlight:\nMr Mohan also referred with pride to The Sun's science reporting. He mentioned his engagement of Professor Brian Cox as \"The Sun's Professor\". He writes for The Sun \"on very complex issues like the Hadron Collider and digests them into very accessible chunks for the readers\". He also referred to praise for The Sun's science coverage by the Science Media Centre: its director, Fiona Fox, said Professor Cox was \"wonderful\". She said that he and others who write on science for tabloids are \"genius\" and went on \"every single day they communicate very complicated and very important science to a mass audience\".\nLeveson sums up his view on the state of science reporting in the following line on page 690: \"The evidence received by the Inquiry suggested that science reporting had improved in recent years, and that the majority of science reporting was responsible and accurate.\" This echoes Fiona Fox's assertion to the Inquiry that \"the content of the copy of science stories, written by science reporters, was generally exemplary,\" even if the headlines attached to them by over-zealous sub-editors were sometimes a problem.\nHmm.\nOne of the problems with this view is that it relies heavily on a particular definition of 'science reporting' that we can also see in Fiona Fox's piece on Leveson in the Guardian today; a piece in which she repeatedly refers to the UK having \"some of the best specialist science reporters in the world\" and describes how, \"in my view, if you locked a group of the best scientists in a room with the main science journalists it would not take them long to come up with a list of guidelines on good science reporting.\"\nOf course if you only include the dedicated specialist science reporters in quality papers, like the excellent teams at The Guardian or The Times, or some of the individual specialists at other newspapers like The Telegraph or even the Mail, then it's probably a fair comment. Similarly, the newspaper industry as a whole would look a lot better if you pretend the tabloids weren't a part of it, the internet is pretty 'family friendly' if you don't look at the porn, and I'm not fat as long as we can both pretend my arse is a different person.\nThe problem is that lots of other people write about science too: from the random quacks who appear in The Guardian's Comment is Free with depressing regularity; to diet advice in lifestyle sections (the majority of which lacks evidence according to a 2011 study); to high-profile columnists at the Mail like Peter \"I don't believe in addiction\" Hitchens, Richard Littlejohn or Melanie Phillips, who spent three months investigating the MMR vaccine in much the way a dog investigates a lamp-post before pissing on it.\nAnd while we're on the subject of definitions, 'accuracy' itself is quite tricky to pin down. The Daily Mail ran an infamous hit piece against the disabled a few months ago, claiming that a quarter of those claiming sickness benefits have a criminal record. This is completely true and accurate, but they neglected to mention one teeny-weeny little fact – a quarter of all working age people have a criminal record. Context is vital to good reporting, and lack of context when reporting studies that may be at odds with the bulk of available evidence - however accurately - is one of the biggest causes of misleading science coverage.\nAfter listening to her evidence, Leveson \"invited Ms Fox to provide some draft guidelines for science journalism which, if followed, would reduce the risk of the press printing the type of story that has received critical comment.\". Fox duly produced them, and Leveson has declared that \"any new regulator should bear them closely in mind.\" They're all good advice, and worth airing again here:\nState the source of the story - e.g. interview, conference, journal article, a survey from a charity or trade body, etc. - ideally with enough information for readers to look it up or a web link.\nSpecify the size and nature of the study - e.g. who\/what were the subjects, how long did it last, what was tested or was it an observation? If space, mention the major limitations.\nWhen reporting a link between two things, indicate whether or not there is evidence that one causes the other.\nGive a sense of the stage of the research - e.g. cells in a laboratory or trials in humans - and a realistic time-frame for any new treatment or technology.\nOn health risks, include the absolute risk whenever it is available in the press release or the research paper - i.e. if 'cupcakes double cancer risk' state the outright risk of that cancer, with and without cupcakes.\nEspecially on a story with public health implications, try to frame a new finding in the context of other evidence - e.g. does it reinforce or conflict with previous studies? If it attracts serious scientific concerns, they should not be ignored.\nIf space, quote both the researchers themselves and external sources with appropriate expertise. Be wary of scientists and press releases over-claiming for studies.\nDistinguish between findings and interpretation or extrapolation; don't suggest health advice if none has been offered.\nRemember patients - don't call something a 'cure' that is not a cure.\nHeadlines should not mislead the reader about a story's contents and quotation marks should not be used to dress up overstatement.\nAlthough Leveson asked for these recommendations, they don't appear to have found their way into the conclusions of his report in any recognizable shape or form. Instead, the main nod to science and health reporting comes on page 1803, when he states that a new code must take into account, \"the interests of the public (including … protecting public health and safety and preventing the public from being seriously misled),\" and cover accuracy.\nCovering accuracy may not make a lot of difference though. It relies on any new body to have the competence to make judgments on claims to begin with, and as I pointed out above it's an easy concept to subvert. It is trivially easy to write an article in which every line is accurate, but the totality of the information conveyed is biased and misleading.\nAlternatively you can outsource the inaccuracy by quoting sources favourable to your particular ideology - the way the Mail regularly uses the Global Warming Policy Foundation – and argue that you have reported their views entirely correctly. As insidious and misleading as the practice of quoting false experts is, the idea of a regulator dictating to journalists whom they're allowed to use as sources seems horrendously Orwellian.\nEven when a fact is clearly wrong, correcting it post-publication may be next to impossible. When the Daily Mail claimed that two-thirds of the public backed their campaign for an automatic block on online porn, I reported them to the PCC. The case was resolved a few days later, with the Mail insisting that \"its interpretation of the study had been reasonable\" but agreeing to take the article down.\nUnfortunately most of the traffic to a news article comes in the first day or two, so by the time the claim had been debunked and retracted it had already spread across the internet and beyond, and the damage had long since been done. Ultimately, any system for promoting accuracy based on corrections to several-day-old posts is doomed to have little impact unless the penalties are scary enough to 'chill' publishers in advance, at which point they're likely to chill decent reporting as well.\nLeveson's comments seem, if anything, to underline the futility of the task of trying to regulate science journalism in any meaningful way. He understands that 'bad science' is a problem, but offers little beyond waving in the general direction of Fiona Fox's advice, advice that is decent, but which most hacks will never read.\nHis grasp of the internet is… limited, and it's hard to get past the thought that, ten years from now, we will remember this as a quaintly-archaic debate about whether we should regulate a few dozen domain names on the internet; a few dozen domain names selected for some pretty arbitrary historic and geographic reasons.\nSocial media didn't exist at the time of the main MMR scare, but if it had, what influence would it have wielded? Will it be old or new media that drive the big health scares of the future? After all, ClimateGate began in the blogosphere, and that was 3 years ago. Will regulating a few websites really make much difference, especially when the 'rules' are so easily evaded?\nA big chunk of my heart would love to see statutory regulation with publishers held properly accountable for false claims, but I don't see any solutions in Lord Justice Leveson's report. In fact as long as the demand for junk science and conspiracy theories exists, I'm not sure that simple solutions exist anywhere. The battle for the truth will probably have to be fought on level ground, and perhaps that's how it ought to be.\n@mjrobbins","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) inaccuracies as it discusses Lord Justice Leveson's focus on accuracy in science reporting.

{"num":14,"Time":"Fri 7 Dec 2018 19.06 CET","Title":"The Tattooist of Auschwitz attacked as inauthentic by camp memorial centre","Content":"Heather Morris’s The Tattooist of Auschwitz, the story of how Slovakian Jew Lali Sokolov fell in love with a girl he was tattooing at the concentration camp, has been one of the year’s bestselling novels. Its cover proclaims that it is “based on the powerful true story of love and survival”; inside, its publisher notes that “every reasonable attempt to verify the facts against available documentation has been made”. But a detailed broadside from the Auschwitz Memorial has disputed this, claiming that “the book contains numerous errors and information inconsistent with the facts, as well as exaggerations, misinterpretations and understatements”.\nThe report from Wanda Witek-Malicka of the Auschwitz Memorial Research Centre lays out concerns that the book’s claims of factual authenticity will lead readers to treat it as “a source of knowledge and imagination about the reality of life” in the camp.\nMorris has previously spoken of how Sokolov began to tell her his story at the age of 87, after the death of his wife Gita Furman. She initially wrote his story as a screenplay, then launched a Kickstarter to raise funds to self-publish it as a book, before finding a publisher. The novel has gone on to top charts around the world, with almost 400,000 copies sold in the UK alone.\n“Ninety-five per cent of it is as it happened; researched and confirmed,” Morris told the Guardian earlier this year. “What has been fictionalised is where I’ve put Lale and Gita into events where really they weren’t. They weren’t together when the American planes flew over the camps, for example. Lale was on his own at that point. I put him and Gita together for dramatic licence.”\nAt the back of the book, Morris thanks two researchers for “their brilliant investigative skills in researching ‘facts’ to ensure history and memory waltzed perfectly in step”.\nBut according to the Auschwitz Memorial’s magazine, Memoria, numerous historical details of the camp are wrong. Witek-Malicka’s fact-checking, which runs to more than seven pages, takes issue with a range of storylines, from the route taken to the camp (“the transport could not have travelled through Ostrava and Pszczyna … [Morris] probably used the modern online search engine of railway connections”), to Morris’s account of the murder of prisoners in a bus being used as a gas chamber, which “does not find confirmation in any sources”.\nPaweł Sawicki, editor-in-chief of Memoria, said it was first prompted to look into the novel when it was asked to double-check the camp number of Gisela Fuhrmannova, Sokolov’s wife, who also went by the name Gita Furman.\nLudwig ‘Lali’ Eisenberg (who changed his last name to Solokov) and Gita Furman, born Gisela Fuhrmannova, with their son. Photograph: Echo publishing\n“We were really surprised to find out that the number given in the book is not correct. It is a very basic but a crucial detail in the story,” Sawicki told the Guardian. “We have also had some information from our guides that visitors have been asking about the history of the tattooist. Some even received this book as a thank-you gift … So we become interested in the story itself and the further we got into the details, the more surprised we were to discover how [many] historical mistakes – small and big – about the reality of Auschwitz were there.”\nBecause the book is presented as “based on a true story”, and most readers “do not have enough knowledge to distinguish facts and fictions here”, the Memorial decided to lay out the history behind the novel.\nWitek-Malicka said that it would have been impossible for Sokolov to get penicillin for Furman, who was infected with typhus, in January 1943: “This antibiotic became widely accessible only after the war.” She also disputed a scene where Auschwitz physician Josef Mengele is shown sterilising a man: “Dr Mengele did not conduct sterilisation experiments on men, but performed experiments on twins and dwarves.”\nWhile Morris’s novel says two crematoriums were blown up during a revolt by Sonderkommando prisoners, Witek-Malicka says only one was partially burned down, adding that a scene where female prisoners deliver gunpowder to the prisoners by carrying it under their fingernails had no historical basis.\nA major point of concern raised in the report “is the sexual relationship described in the book between the head of the camp SS-Obersturmführer Johann Schwarzhuber and the Jewish female prisoner Cilka”. In practice, the report says, “the possibility of maintaining such a long relationship … and according to the book, a semi-explicit relationship between a Jewish female prisoner and a high-ranking member of the SS hierarchy was non-existent”.\nThe number of different errors in the book can sometimes create more confusion than understanding\nPaweł Sawicki\nThe Auschwitz Memorial is not the first to flag concerns about the novel. An article in the New York Times in November pointed out that the number that Morris says was tattooed on Furman was 34902, but that Furman herself testified that her number was 4562. Blogger Lisa Hill highlighted the penicillin error in June. Sokolov’s son Gary told the New York Times that it bothered him his father’s name had been misspelled “Lale”, rather than “Lali” in the novel.\nThe Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum concluded that the novel is “an impression about Auschwitz inspired by authentic events, almost without any value as a document”.\n“The nature of human memory, especially where the events recalled occurred over 70 years ago, requires confrontation with other sources. From today’s perspective, we can only regret that no specialist in the area of camp matters was invited to work on the book,” the report ends. “Given the number of factual errors, therefore, this book cannot be recommended as a valuable title for persons who want to explore and understand the history of KL Auschwitz.”\nWhen approached by the Guardian, Morris declined further comment. She told the Australian, which first covered the report: “I have written a story of the Holocaust, not the story of the Holocaust. I have written Lale’s story.” In November, she told the New York Times: “The book does not claim to be an academic historical piece of non-fiction, I’ll leave that to the academics and historians.”\nA spokesperson for her publisher told the Guardian on Friday: “The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a novel based on the personal recollections and experiences of one man. It is not, and has never claimed to be, an official history. If it inspires people to engage with the terrible events of the Holocaust more deeply, then it will have achieved everything that Lale himself wished for.”\nBut Sawicki took issue with Morris’s response. “Can ‘a story’ be told without paying attention to the reality of the story? If this would be a complete fictional story, we could say that the author does not know much about the history of Auschwitz. This book, however, tells a story of a real person, his real tragic experiences, and this puts much more responsibility on a person who tells this story to the world,” he said. “The number of different errors in the book – not only in simple basic facts but also in the depiction of the reality of Auschwitz – can sometimes create more confusion than understanding. It turns a real story into an interpretation – very moving and emotional – that however blurs the authenticity of this true experience. We believe that the survivor’s story deserved better.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about the book 'The Tattooist of Auschwitz' by Heather Morris being attacked as inauthentic by the Auschwitz Memorial Centre.

It’s a messy, complex, statistical system that is wrong a lot,” Warren said. “All models are wrong, but some are useful. It’s the choice of how you deal with when the system is wrong that reveals how you view the world.”\nOnce a discrepancy is detected by the automated data-matching process – currently occurring at a rate of 20,000 a week – the onus then falls on welfare recipients to prove they were entitled to claim benefits, often forcing them to find payslips and employment information from up to six years ago.\n“What the department has done, however, is placed all the work of proving an error exists on the humans they are supposed to serve (the clue is in the name),” Warren said. “The humans have to do a bunch of paperwork to prove the machine is wrong.\n“Prioritising efficiency over human welfare is just one choice among many. I don’t think it’s the ethical choice.”\nThe Australian Privacy Foundation described the system as a “clusterfuck”, that wrongly assumed the initial data matching was accurate and then abandoned procedural fairness.\n“There’s so much that can go wrong here that it’s astounding,” the foundation’s chair, Kat Lane, said. “And falsely accusing people of things, and sending them letters, and particularly some of our most disadvantaged people … you’d want to make sure you got it absolutely right before doing that.”\nLane said the sharing of data en masse should also cause significant privacy concerns for Australians.\n“This is just the thin edge of the wedge, there is a clear plan to do comprehensive data matching of every silo of government,” Lane said. “It’s tracking, you’re tracking your citizens.

REUTERS\/Noah Berger\nThe rare apology follows Apple’s launch of its own mapping service earlier this month, when it began selling the iPhone 5 and rolled out iOS 6, the highly anticipated update to its mobile software platform.\nUsers complained that the new Maps service - based on Dutch navigation equipment and digital map maker TomTom NV's TOM2.AS's data - contained geographical errors and gaps in information, and that it lacked features that made Google Maps so popular, including public transit directions, comprehensive traffic data or street view pictures.\n“We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better,” Cook said in a letter to customers released on its website, adding that the company “fell short” of its commitment to deliver “the best experience possible to our customers.”\nUnusually, he suggested that customers download rival mapping services available in Apple’s App Store, while the company improves the product.\n“While we’re improving Maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing, MapQuest and Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app,” he said in the letter.\n“It is a bit unusual but at the same time, Tim is keeping Apple’s commitment to provide the best user experience for customers,” Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said. “A key reason for Apple’s success is keeping customers happy so we think this is a good move.”\n“People forget that Google Maps started out inferior to Mapquest and Yahoo Maps,” he added.\nApple is typically loathe to tout rival services and the contrite apology by Cook is an indication of how Apple is changing under the chief executive who took over last year from co-founder Steve Jobs just before his death.\nShares of Apple were down 1.8 percent in late morning trading at $669.22.\nNEW APPLE\nThe last time Apple faced such widespread criticism was in 2010, when users complained of signal reception issues on the then-new iPhone 4 model.\nA defiant Jobs at the time rejected any suggestion the iPhone 4’s design was flawed, but offered consumers free phone cases at a rare, 90-minute press conference called to address those complaints.\nWhile Apple fixed the issue, Jobs had apologized to users only after he was specifically asked if he was sorry. He also said the issue was shared by all the major manufacturers, naming rivals Research in MotionRIMM.O, Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and HTC Corp2498.TW specifically.\nCook’s suggestion that Apple users download other map apps, particularly Google Maps, represents an about-turn for Apple, which had introduced its service as a direct challenge to the popular service offered by ally-turned-rival Google.\nApple Maps replaced the Google Maps app, which is no longer available on iOS 6. Users now have to access Google Maps through the browser.\nCook said that more that more than 100 million iOS devices are using the new Apple Maps and that the more people use Maps, the better it will get. He also offered some hints on why the company decided to remove Google Maps.\nApple launched the Google-powered Maps “initially with the first version of iOS” and the company created a home-grown version of the service as it wanted to provide more features, Cook said.\n“As time progressed, we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turn-by-turn directions, voice integration, Flyover and vector-based maps,” he said in the letter.\nGoogle provides turn-by-turn navigation on Android-based devices but the popular feature was not available for Apple devices.\nGoogle and Apple were close partners with the original iPhone in 2007 and its inclusion of YouTube and Google Maps. But ties between the two companies have been strained by the rise of Google’s Android mobile operating system, now the world’s leading platform for smartphones.\nGoogle Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said earlier this week that it has not submitted a new Google Maps app to Apple, but added the search giant talks to the Cupertino-based company “every day.”\nEditing by Bernadette Baum\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) inaccuracies.

{"num":21,"Time":"Thu 4 Jun 2015 12.10 CEST","Title":"How scientifically accurate is San Andreas? Rock solid or a bit faulty?","Content":"First of all, San Andreas is a fun film. It’s interesting. But it has a bit of a fatalistic scenario of destruction – one we hope will never actually happen – and the film makes several scientific errors.\nMeasurement\nThere’s a scene at the beginning of San Andreas where the seismologist Lawrence, played by Paul Giamatti, uses the term “Richter magnitude” when referring to a large earthquake. Now, Richter magnitude is used a lot by journalists, but the Richter scale is actually for local magnitude. It was developed for assessing small earthquakes in California, and so the actual scale cannot capture very large earthquakes. It’s unable to record them. Seismologists would, in fact, use something called the moment magnitude scale to measure these large events. It’s a small thing, but it’s just not the term we would use.\nPaul Giamatti and Archie Panjabi in San Andreas. Photograph: Jasin Boland\/AP\nThe problem with predictions\nIn addition, there’s an issue about earthquake prediction. I’ve never heard that an increase in magnetic pulses can tip us off about potential earthquakes. I’m not a seismologist, but from what I know about the field, we cannot “predict” earthquakes, in the sense that science is not developed enough to say there will be a quake in a certain place at a specific time. What can be done is a probabilistic forecast, which basically says that in the next 10 years there will be an earthquake of a certain magnitude. Such forecasts are based on observations of past events and knowledge about local faults.\nWatch a clip from San Andreas – video\nDestruction\nIn the film, an earthquake destroys the Hoover Dam. As a structural engineer, it worries me slightly that a 7.0 magnitude earthquake would cause the Hoover Dam to fail – it should be designed to withstand a larger quake. But there’s another fault with this scene: in the film, it looked as if there were a series of internal explosions within the dam, and that’s not a phenomenon we would expect, or how we’d expect the damage to occur.\nThe word from Hollywood: sensible is the new sexy\nCatherine Shoard\nRead more\nThen there’s the damage to people. In general, the death and destruction portrayed in the film is quite negative, because it inspires fatalism and promotes a sense of helplessness. The film also undermines seismic design. New buildings are designed to be resilient against earthquakes. They would be heavily damaged, but there would be time to get out of them before they might collapse. To see buildings crumbling in San Andreas suggests that engineers are unable to design against these sorts of events – this is simply not true. We can’t protect against every sort of damage, but we can ensure that buildings stand up in a way that allows people to escape.\nWatch a clip of buildings collapsing in San Andreas – video\nThe tsunami\nPhysically, an earthquake-triggered tsunami happens at a subduction fault, which San Andreas is not. San Andreas is a land-based fault, which moves along the rupture horizontally (by the way, the fault would never open up as it does in the movie, leaving a gaping chasm in the ground). As the fault is not under the water there is no way that it would actually displace any water and create a tsunami. The only physical thing that might have generated a tsunami would be an underwater landslide triggered from the ground shaking. It’s a possibility, I suppose.\nAlso, it was such a large inundation reaching the 10th or 15th storey of a building. I mean, you’re talking 30 to 45 metres of inundation. That’s just enormous. To have such an inundation height so far inland is a bit unrealistic, but very theatrical!\nWatch the Guardian Film Show’s verdict on San Andreas – video Guardian\nConclusion\nSan Andreas is entertaining and the special effects are amazing, but the chaos and destruction is exaggerated. But I suppose that’s the whole point of this sort of blockbuster Hollywood movie. What you do really see is the value of preparedness. At one point, Lawrence (Giamatti) says something along the lines of: “It’s not a matter of ‘there may or may not be an earthquake’, it’s when.” That’s the case with most areas with high seismic activity. We have to prepare for when an earthquake will happen, because it will. We don’t know what size it will be or when it will take place, but we need to be prepared at personal, community and government levels in order to minimise the consequences. The importance of having an emergency plan and being prepared does come through in the film, and that’s a positive thing.\nTiziana Rossetto is a professor of earthquake engineering at University College London.

I’ve used Samsung before, but the operation, the feeling, of the iPhone is better,” said Wataru Saito, a semiconductor engineer who had been queuing in Tokyo since mid-afternoon on Thursday - with his suitcase, as he had a flight to catch on Friday.\nIn Hong Kong, people carrying rucksacks filled with cash waited outside the city’s main Apple store, hoping to snap up phones for resale. Staff there chanted “iPhone 5, iPhone 5.”\nMost of those waiting were fans already hooked on Apple’s earlier iPhones and best-selling iPad tablet computers.\n“I feel like if I leave it at home, I go a bit crazy,” said James Vohradsky, a 20-year-old student who queued for 17 hours with his sister. “I can’t do my normal day without it.”\nVohradsky said the iPhone 5's lack of a mobile payment chip was \"a bit of a letdown\". Apple did not embed Near Field Communication NFC.L technology, used to turn cellphones into mobile wallets, into the new smartphone.\nVohradsky was less bothered by Apple’s decision to drop the wide dock connector used in the company’s gadgets for the best part of a decade in favour of a smaller one, a move that some critics say adds to costs for users, who will have to buy an adaptor for speakers and other accessories.\nRUNNING OUT\nThere was also concern that not enough new phones were available to meet demand.\nSoftbank and Singtel STEL.SI, Singapore's biggest mobile phone operator, said demand for the iPhone 5 had exceeded previous offerings from Apple and there was worry Apple would not be able to keep up.\nJapanese carrier KDDI Corp 9433.T said it had already run out of the new phone, and Australia's Telstra Corp Ltd TLS.AX reported online orders sold out in a record 18 hours. Telstra said it was discussing bi-weekly restocking with Apple.\nApple plans to sell the new phone in 100 countries by the end of the year, ramping up competition in a smartphone market that has already reached fever pitch.\nSamsung and Apple are locked in a patent battle in 10 countries and the stakes are high as the two vie for the top spot in the booming smartphone market.\nApple is up against phones that run on Google Inc's GOOG.O Android software, which has become the most-used mobile operating system in the world, while Samsung has taken the lead in smartphone sales.\nThe iPhone is Apple’s highest-margin product and accounts for half of its annual revenue.\nAdditional reporting by Thuy Ong in Sydney, Venus Wu and Stefanie McIntyre in Hong Kong, Kevin Lim in Singapore and Poornima Gupta in San Francisco, Harro Ten Wolde in Frankfurt, Gwenaelle Barzic in Paris and Kate Holton in London, Sinead Carew in New York and Medina Roshan in Annapolis.; Editing by Angus MacSwan and John Wallace\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"The provided news does mention issues related to inaccurate maps, which suggests relevance to Geographic Information Systems inaccuracies.

{"num":20,"Time":"SEPTEMBER 25, 2015","Title":"Lack of groundwater data is keeping Kenya thirsty, experts say","Content":"By Maina Waruru, Thomson Reuters Foundation\nNAIROBI, Sept 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Charles Wachira, the proprietor of Maji Drilling Services, was contracted by a local church organisation to sink four borehole wells for a pastoralist community in north-central Kenya, his first worry was how to find water.\nWachira knew how much his services were needed. The Samburu community of Laikipia County uses water both at home and to raise the thousands of goats, sheep and cattle they keep as their sole source of livelihood.\nBut he also knew that it would be almost impossible to find reliable data on groundwater in the thirsty area.\nWachira spent weeks checking with fellow drillers, local non-governmental organisations and ranchers in the area to see if they had any statistics to help him figure out where the water was, whether it was good to use and how much was available.\nThe information they provided wasn’t sufficient, so Wachira had to carry out his own hydro-geological survey, at extra cost to the church that had hired him, before he could start drilling.\n“Data on groundwater is never easy to come across in Kenya, yet it is critical in planning for drilling for this increasingly scarce resource,” he said.\nAs Kenya struggles through longer and more frequent droughts, the lack of reliable data on groundwater is becoming an increasingly urgent problem, experts say.\nWithout accurate statistics on the location, quality and quantity of groundwater, Kenya cannot properly plan for its increasingly harsh dry spells, they say.\n“A common platform for data, accessible to all interested parties, is urgently needed,” said Sylvester Kiai, a hydrologist at the Kenya Water Industry Association (KWIA), a lobby group made up of water services companies and drilling contractors.\nThe data that is available mainly comes from Kenya’s multi-million-dollar water drilling industry, which has flourished over the past 15 years thanks to the sharp rise in demand for groundwater as streams, rivers and wells dry up.\nBut according to Kiai, the information is often inaccurate, piecemeal and only relevant to the person or project that collects it.\n“As things stand, anyone wanting to construct a dam, for example, would have to pay millions of shillings to carry out a geological survey because data is disjointed and is held by different parties who generate it for their specific purposes,” he said.\nKiai would like to see the government use technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to capture, store and analyse information on the country’s groundwater supply, and mobile phone applications to help share the resulting data.\n“Water industry players, including the government, must now take advantage of available technologies to close the existing gaps and help in things like drought interventions,” he said.\nThe government should also work closely with the country’s water users associations to keep track of individuals drilling wells for commercial, domestic or agriculture purposes, Kiai said. Then industry players could pool their resources to gather information on wells, aquifers and boreholes, and share that data.\nHOW ACCURATE?\nThe availability of data isn’t the only problem. Another issue is accuracy, said Wangai Ndirangu, director of the Water Capacity Building Network, a local NGO. Again, technology could be the answer, he said.\n“The use of emerging technologies can help in enhancing the quality of statistics and this is very important to end frequent complaints over reliability of data,” Ndirangu said. GIS and remote-sensing technologies can be expensive but effective ways of correctly pinpointing the location of groundwater, he said.\nAccording to John Philip Olum, head of the water ministry’s Water Resource Management Authority, the government is aware of the urgency of the problem and has started the process of mapping groundwater resources in select parts of the country.\nAquifers “have been mapped in parts of the central and Nairobi region and in areas south of Lake Victoria, and soon some parts of northern Kenya will follow”, he said, adding that the ministry is also making efforts to address the problem of unreliable data.\nUntil then, locating and managing groundwater in Kenya will continue to be an arduous and inexact task, drillers say.\nAfter three weeks of research, contractor Wachira was finally able to drill wells for the Samburu villagers, giving them access to the water they needed. But he hopes that one day he will be able to get water to people faster and more efficiently.\n“Life would become much easier for me and my business if reliable data was available on request,” he said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses the lack of groundwater data in Kenya, which is causing problems, particularly in planning for drilling for this increasingly scarce resource due to longer and more frequent droughts.

Those that do have very few images of people with dark skin.\nThese apps say they can detect cancer. But are they only for white people?\nRead more\nDr David Wen, first author of the study from the University of Oxford, said: “You could have a situation where the regulatory authorities say that because this algorithm has only been trained on images in fair-skinned people, you’re only allowed to use it for fair-skinned individuals, and therefore that could lead to certain populations being excluded from algorithms that are approved for clinical use.\n“Alternatively, if the regulators are a bit more relaxed and say: ‘OK, you can use it [on all patients]’, the algorithms may not perform as accurately on populations who don’t have that many images involved in training.”\nThat could bring other problems including risking avoidable surgery, missing treatable cancers and causing unnecessary anxiety, the team said.\nWriting in the journal Lancet Digital Health, Wen and colleagues report how they identified 21 open-access datasets for skin cancer images of which 14 recorded their country of origin. Of these, 11 included images only from Europe, North America and Oceania.\nFew of the 21 datasets recorded the ethnicity or skin type of the individuals photographed, with the team noting that means it is unclear how generalisable algorithms based on them would be.\nThe team found just 2,436 of a total of 106,950 images within the 21 databases had skin type recorded. Of these, only 10 images were from people recorded as having brown skin and one was from an individual recorded as having dark brown or black skin.\nOnly 1,585 images contained data on ethnicity instead of, or as well as, information on skin type. “No images were from individuals with an African, African-Caribbean or South Asian background,” the team report.\n“Coupled with the geographical origins of datasets, there was massive under-representation of skin lesion images from darker-skinned populations,” they add.\nWen said the omissions are unlikely to be deliberate but that there is a need for standards to ensure important information, including ethnicity or skin type, is reported with images. The authors add datasets used to develop AI systems should represent the populations the technology will be used in.\nCharlotte Proby, professor of dermatology at the University of Dundee and British Skin Foundation spokesperson – who was not involved in the work – said the findings are of concern.\n“Failure to train AI tools using images from darker skin types may impact on their reliability for assessment of skin lesions in skin of colour,” she said, adding there could be wider implications.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses a study highlighting the risk of AI systems used for skin cancer diagnosis being less accurate for people with dark skin.

They found only 5% of people had their self-reported ethnicity wrongly reported in their hospital records overall, because the vast majority of white British people had their ethnicity correctly recorded, but among ethnic minorities it rose to 40%.\nSaunders, whose paper was a runner up in the RSS’s young statistician of the year competition, said: “If the aim [of analysis] is to compare outcomes between white and non-white groups the classification system will work well but a degree of caution is required when interpreting more detailed evidence on ethnic inequalities in care quality or disease incidence and prevalence.”\nSaunders said that the NHS has been recording ethnicity since 2000 but that audits of the quality of the information have focused on completeness rather than accuracy.\nIt is unclear why some hospital records are inaccurate. Saunders was unable to account for the process by which ethnicity was ascertained in the records but said that as well as self-reporting by patients it could involve information given by relatives or carers, for example where the patient was infirm, or even “guesswork” by hospital staff, for example in the case of clinical emergencies or language barriers. There is also the possibility that people’s self-identified ethnic group could change over time due to sociocultural trends or changes in census methodology. People who self-reported mixed ethnic backgrounds were found to be particularly likely to have an incorrectly coded ethnic group in their hospital records.\nThe researchers found variations between hospitals, which Saunders said indicated room for hospitals with higher levels of inaccuracy to improve their processes.\nStudies have found that heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers disproportionately affect some black and minority ethnic communities. In the NHS, women under 65 from Asian and black ethnic groups diagnosed with breast cancer have been found to have poorer survival outcomes than the white population.\nPriscilla Nkwenti, chief executive of BHA, a charity which works for equality in health and social care, said: “If what people are self-reporting and what people are recording is not accurate then the analysts analysing the data are not going to see where the inequalities are. The importance is ensuring that resources are targeted properly and that is not happening now.”\nAn NHS England spokeswoman said: “We welcome this research and recognise that accurate recording of ethnicity is vital when collecting data, because of the variations in outcomes for different ethnic groups. We urge staff collecting the data to ensure that their recording matches a patient’s declared ethnicity. The National Information Board has recently set out a bold vision committing to give everybody online access to their medical records, viewed through approved apps and digital platforms, which will make these discrepancies a thing of the past.”\nThis article was amended on Monday 1 December 2014.

It shows high numbers of inaccurate debts in areas of western Sydney, Bundaberg, Mackay, Toowoomba, the New South Wales central coast and around Cranbourne in Melbourne’s south-eastern fringes.\nOuter suburbs of the Gold Coast, Hervey Bay and Ipswich in Queensland were also listed in the top 20, as were Ballarat and Werribee in Victoria.\nBut lawyers have warned the statistics do not give a complete picture. The data only reflects debts where a review or appeal took place.\nVictoria Legal Aid’s executive director of civil justice, Dan Nicholson, said the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups were less likely to have appealed.\n“I think on the face of it, it’s a shocking number of wrong debts to be alleged but in fact the most concerning thing is the very large number of people who would not have challenged their debts, and would now be paying back debts that were wrongly or unlawfully raised against them,” Nicholson said.\n“We know those people are most likely to be the most disadvantaged in the community, and therefore the people that it may affect the most.”\nThe human services minister, Alan Tudge, has insisted the system is capable of calculating debts fairly. He pointed to to the ombudsman’s report earlier this year, which made a string of criticisms of the system but found it was able to accurately raise a debt, so long as it was provided with the proper information.\n“Of course, if someone provides new accurate information, then a different debt figure is calculated. This has always been the case,” Tudge said. “The percentage of online compliance system debts subsequently reduced to zero after the welfare recipient has provided further information is almost identical to under the old manual system – about 3%.”\nCriticism of the system began just before Christmas last year. From July last year, the government introduced a new way of clawing back debts from welfare recipients.\nIt removed a layer of human oversight from an automated data matching process, which compares an individual’s tax records with the earnings they have reported to Centrelink.\nWhere previously compliance teams would manually check discrepancies in tax and Centrelink records, the new system immediately sent a letter to the welfare recipient.\nCentrelink sends welfare recipients fraud warning via text message\nRead more\nThat shifted the onus to disproving the debt on to vulnerable Australians. It also allowed the government to significantly ramp up the scale of its debt recovery program.\nIt shifted people to use a new online tool to prove their entitlement to welfare, often forcing people to find payslips that were up to six years old.\nThousands of letters were sent to the wrong address. Others were either ignored or not understood.\nIf no response was received, a debt was raised against the individual. A longer period of non-response would see the debt referred to an external debt collector.\n“The [online compliance intervention] project effectively shifted complex fact-finding and data entry functions from the department to the individual and its success relied on its usability,” the ombudsman’s report found earlier this year.\nThe process also led to flaws in the calculation method.\nIf no response was received, Centrelink would use an “income averaging” method to calculate the debt.\nThe method takes an individual’s annual income and averages it over Centrelink’s 26 fortnightly reporting periods, thereby assuming an individual had worked for the entire year and was ineligible for welfare.\n“The obligation on Centrelink is not to raise a debt unless it is satisfied it exists in the relevant amount,” Nicholson said. “Its job is to use its powers fairly and accurately, not to go on a fishing expedition and expect people to do hours work to correct Centrelink’s basic mistakes.\n“We think there are real doubts about the lawfulness of the approach they have used.”\nIn a joint statement, the shadow human services minister, Linda Burney, and the Labor MP Steven Georganas called on Tudge to apologise to the 20,000 individuals.\n“These are absolutely shocking results and reveal the extent to which Mr Tudge has fudged the management of the robo-debt debacle,” they said. “Minister Tudge made them feel frightened, anxious and like criminals, and he should apologise.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about the Centrelink scandal involving tens of thousands of welfare debts being wiped or reduced.

Those trying to access it found an Internet page carrying court rulings saying it had been blocked as a “protection measure”.\nMany Turks reported difficulties in accessing not just Twitter but the Internet as a whole, according to media reports and comments on social media.\nErdogan’s office said in a statement the ban on Twitter had come in response to the company’s “defiance” in failing to comply with hundreds of court rulings since last January.\n“Twitter has been used as a means to carry out systematic character assassinations by circulating illegally acquired recordings, fake and fabricated records of wiretapping,” the prime minister’s office said.\nIn recent weeks, audio recordings have been released via Twitter on an almost daily basis purporting to be telephone conversations involving Erdogan, senior government members and businessmen that reveal alleged corruption.\n“It is difficult to comprehend Twitter’s indifference and its biased and prejudiced stance. We believe that this attitude is damaging to the brand image of the company in question and creates an unfair and inaccurate impression of our country,” the statement from Erdogan’s office said.\nSimilar measures have been taken on the same grounds in other countries to prevent violations of personal rights and threats to national security, the statement added.\nErdogan is battling a corruption scandal which he says is a plot to undermine him by a U.S.-based Turkish Islamic cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Gulen is a former ally whose network of followers include influential members of Turkey’s police and judiciary. Gulen denies orchestrating the graft investigation.\nErdogan’s government has responded to the scandal by tightening controls of the Internet and the courts and reassigning thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges, often demoting them.\nACCOUNT CLOSED\nThe Turkish government began talks with Twitter on Friday, saying the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.\n“The talks are continuing in Ankara and the process is going positively. The biggest problem with Twitter until now has been the lack of contact and that has been resolved,” the senior government official told Reuters.\nHe said one of the accounts to which Ankara objected had been closed and talks on others were continuing, but that it was too early to say when a solution would be reached. Turkish media reports said the closed account had contained pornographic material and did not refer to any link to the graft scandal.\n“As far as we are concerned, when the court rulings are implemented the problems will be resolved and the block on Twitter will be lifted,” said the senior official.\nThe ban stirred concerns that Turkey may pull the plug on other social media and Internet services, but the government official said there were no plans to impose restrictions on other social media like Facebook or YouTube.\nTwitter said in a tweet on Friday that it stood with its users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a “vital” communications platform. It said it hoped to have full access returned soon.\nErdogan did not talk mention the Twitter ban at election campaign rallies on Friday. He was due to address another rally in the capital Ankara on Saturday.\nMany Turks have been able to get around the Twitter ban, either by using virtual private network (VPN) software or changing their Domain Name System (DNS) setting, effectively disguising their computers’ geographical whereabouts.\nBut on Saturday morning, many people reported that computers that had been set with DNS numbers widely circulated to help people get around the ban were unable to access the Internet.\n“Apparently alternate DNS servers are also blocked in Turkey. New settings are being circulated,” wrote one user.\nThere was no official comment on whether alternate servers had been blocked.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nCNN\n — \nThe chance discovery of large fossil specimens in a museum drawer have led researchers to conclude there was a gigantic marine reptile called a pliosaur swimming the seas 152 million years ago, according to a recent study.\nThe findings from the Late Jurassic period, though fragmentary, suggest the pliosaur was about twice the size of a killer whale — and move lead study author David Martill closer to redemption. That’s due to what many researchers considered inaccurate claims he made about the size of another pliosaur in the BBC’s 1999 television documentary series “Walking With Dinosaurs.”\nOne of the episodes “showed a 25-metre long Liopleurodon,” which “sparked heated debates … as it was thought to have been wildly overestimated and more likely to have only reached an adult size of just over six metres long,” according to a news release about the current study, published May 10 in the journal Proceedings of the Geologists’ Association.\nWhat defines a species?\nMartill, who was a consultant for the episode and is currently a professor in the University of Portsmouth’s School of the Environment, Geography and Geosciences in the United Kingdom, said he got the size “horrendously wrong.”\n“I based my calculations on some fragmentary material which suggested a Liopleurodon could grow to a length of 25 metres, but the evidence was scant and it caused a lot of controversy at the time,” he said in a statement. “Now we have some evidence that is much more reliable after a serendipitous discovery of four enormous (vertebrae).”\n‘Very fearsome animals’\nMartill recently found one of those vertebrae in a drawer of fossils at Abingdon County Hall Museum in England, and subsequently learned the curator had three more in storage. The vertebrae were large, with a maximum width of 269 millimeters (10.5 inches), maximum height of 222 millimeters (8.7 inches) and maximum length of 103 millimeters (4 inches).\nDue to the size of the vertebrae and comparisons to other fossils of other species from the Mid Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods, the researchers concluded they were closely related to pliosaurs or a similar but undescribed species, according to the study.\nTopographic scans showed the reptile might have grown to between 9.8 and 14.4 meters (roughly between 32 and 47 feet) long, the authors wrote.\n“Although not yet on a par with the claims made for Liopleurodon in the iconic BBC TV series ‘Walking with Dinosaurs,’” Martill added, “it wouldn’t surprise me if one day we find some clear evidence that this monstrous species was even bigger.”\nAdam S. Smith, curator of natural sciences at the Nottingham Natural History Museum, Wollaton Hall, agreed.\n“It isn’t out of the question that pliosaurs may have exceeded 15 metres long,” Smith said via email. However, he cautioned that an increase in length corresponds with an “exponential increase in volume … placing a biological limit on the upper size pliosaurs could reach.” Smith wasn’t involved in the study.\nA new group of butterflies has been named after the 'Lord of the Rings' villain\nPliosaurs were “a group of large carnivorous marine reptiles characterized by massive heads, short necks and streamlined tear-shaped bodies,” according to Britannica. Four large fins helped propel the ancient creatures through seas. Pliosaurs were similar to plesiosaurs, their relatives in the order Plesiosauria, but had bigger elongated heads and shorter necks.\n“We know these pliosaurs were very fearsome animals swimming in the seas that covered Oxfordshire 145-152 million years ago,” Martill said. “They had a massive skull with huge protruding teeth like daggers — as big, if not bigger than, a T. rex, and certainly more powerful.\n“They were at the top of the marine food chain and probably preyed on ichthyosaurs, long-necked plesiosaurs and maybe even smaller marine crocodiles, simply by biting them in half and taking chunks off them,” he added. “We know they were massacring smaller marine reptiles because you can see bite marks in ichthyosaur bones in examples on display in The Etches Collection in Dorset.”\nLimitations of guesstimating size\nValentin Fischer, a professor in the department of geology at the University of Liège who wasn’t part of the study, called the findings “shaky” since lengths of cervical vertebrae — the type the authors analyzed — from pliosaurs can vary.\nAnother expert, however, thought estimates weren’t necessarily a bad thing.\n“Scaling is always reliant on a best guess using the specimens we know,” said Andrew Cuff, a UK-based paleontologist who wasn’t involved in the study, via email. “The author in this current study seem to have done a good job comparing specimens and attempting to scale up the more complete fossil individuals so that the newly described vertebrae would fit. Whether the 14.4m is realistic or possibly too large will require more complete specimens to confirm for sure but I wouldn’t be surprised if a pliosaur that large did swim the Jurassic seas.”\nHow did massive prehistoric 'thunder beasts' get super big, super fast?\nThe vertebrae were initially found during excavations at Warren Farm in the River Thames Valley near Abingdon in Oxfordshire, and derive from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, according to the study.\n“This kind of discovery reminds us that there were some amazing animals in the past,” Michael Benton, a professor of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Bristol in the UK, said via email. Benton wasn’t involved in the study. “Here is a marine reptile as large as a sperm whale, and there’s nothing like it around today.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant because it discusses the discovery of large fossil specimens in a museum drawer that led researchers to conclude there was a gigantic marine reptile called a pliosaur swimming the seas 152 million years ago.

He also said the issue was shared by all the major manufacturers, naming rivals Research in Motion, Samsung Electronics and HTC Corp specifically.\nCook’s suggestion that Apple users download other map apps, particularly Google Maps, represents an about-turn for Apple, which had introduced its service as a direct challenge to the popular service offered by ally-turned-rival Google.\nApple Maps replaced the Google Maps app, which is no longer available on iOS 6. Users now have to access Google Maps through the browser.\nCook said that more that more than 100 million iOS devices are using the new Apple Maps and that the more people use Maps, the better it will get. He also offered some hints on why the company decided to remove Google Maps.\nApple launched the Google-powered Maps “initially with the first version of iOS” and the company created a home-grown version of the service as it wanted to provide more features, Cook said.\n“As time progressed, we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turn-by-turn directions, voice integration, Flyover and vector-based maps,” he said in the letter.\nGoogle provides turn-by-turn navigation on Android-based devices but the popular feature was not available for Apple devices.\nGoogle and Apple were close partners with the original iPhone in 2007 and its inclusion of YouTube and Google Maps.

Then, 30 people fixed any errors over a period of 10 months.\nFor land managers, better and more detailed maps help to improve how resources are conserved, Allenby said.\nThat painstaking process is set to get much quicker. U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp hopes using artificial intelligence and machine learning will speed up the labour-intensive approach used by Chesapeake Conservancy.\n“Your brain has an algorithm that’s been trained to (identify images): ‘That’s a tree, that’s a car, that’s a boat,’” said Microsoft chief environmental officer Lucas Joppa.\nBut, he said, the volume of such data flowing in on a daily basis from around the world precludes such human analysis.\n“What we need to be able to do is train computers to do that.”\nWARP-SPEED PROCESSING\nChesapeake Conservancy, which specialises in using high-tech to make environmental restoration quicker and more efficient, said more detailed land-cover maps that were updated more frequently would help conservationists.\nBefore it started this mapmaking project, the best available version was from 2011 and had a 30-metre resolution. The new map, using 2016 satellite imagery, has resolution to one metre, making it 900 times more detailed.\nAt a 30-metre resolution, a single pixel comprises about 0.25 acres (0.1 hectares), which could identify a farmer’s field, for example.\nBut at a one-metre resolution, a single pixel can identify an individual crop, said Jim Levitt, co-founder of the International Land Conservation Network.\n“If you have a one-square-metre resolution you can deploy vegetative buffers along streams at exactly the place where the water will flow in a storm,” he said, describing a scenario of rainfall causing polluted runoff from a field that drains into a stream.\n“If you are able to do precision conservation and that allows you to measurably reduce the amount of nutrients that flow into a larger river system, then you have a much better chance of taking care of these very large - and to date intractable - problems.”\nChesapeake Conservancy’s Allenby said being able to measure performance in that way “is a game-changer, because it allows you to make more effective decisions about where to invest your resources”.\nIt is, he added, “a fundamentally different way of thinking about land management”.\nSince Chesapeake Conservancy produced its map, Microsoft has used technology to process land-cover images at much higher speeds as part of its AI for Earth initiative.\nEarlier this year, its deep-learning initiative called Project Brainwave began using a specialist computer chip called a field programmable gate array.\nWorking with Microsoft’s cloud service, it processed nearly 200 million satellite images in only 10 minutes and - for a cost of $42 - produced a draft land-cover map of the entire United States.\nFor Allenby, such speeds could scale the Chesapeake project nationally - something that is impossible with its current approach.\n“We would need a warehouse of workers going 24\/7 to turn out a national data-set in any reasonable amount of time,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via phone from Maryland.\nGETTING SMARTER\nBeing able to generate high-resolution land cover maps fast means conservation groups can measure change more frequently, and hone in on places where, for example, forests are quickly becoming housing.\nSince the Chesapeake Conservancy started working with Microsoft in February 2016, it has used the company’s processing power to produce similar land-cover maps for decision makers in Iowa and Arizona. It is now planning to map the Great Lakes region.\nHowever, accuracy remains a challenge, said Allenby.\nFor example, the machine learning algorithm based on the blue and green tones of the Chesapeake watershed did not compute the beige and sandstone colours that dominate the arid landscape of Pima County, Arizona.\n“Remote sensing is never a direct replacement for actual boots on the ground. What it can do is help direct you to areas you need to focus on,” Allenby said.\nDespite its shortcomings, the approach has helped the Trust for Public Land, a San Francisco-based non-profit that advocates for parks.\nIt uses the technology to prioritize where to build parks among 98,000 locations in the country that the trust has determined are underserved by green space.\nThe organization cross-referenced on a map pre-identified areas that lack parks with data measuring the “urban heat island effect” - whereby cities are often several degrees warmer than nearby rural areas due to heat trapped by dark-coloured roads and buildings.\nThe purpose was to see where parks could not only fill an open space need, but also reduce temperatures, said Pete Aniello, the group’s geographic information specialist.\n“To process a heat island attribute from 100 gigabytes of data and provide that attribute to 98,000 points is a huge data-processing problem that would be barely possible - or impossible - without the Microsoft data science machine,” said Aniello.\nKEY QUESTIONS\nMicrosoft’s Joppa said he was hopeful artificial intelligence could serve a greater good. After all, he said, the technology industry had expended vast efforts training computers to recognize celebrities, faces and the spoken word.\n“We just haven’t focused our skill and our focus on some of these bigger societal challenges,” he said at Microsoft’s Redmond, Washington headquarters.\nHe said accurate land maps would prove vital in answering key questions for land managers.\n“We don’t know what is where, we don’t know how much is there, and we don’t know how fast it’s changing,” he said.\n“Yet those three questions are at the heart of some of our most contentious land use and economic development conversations in the country,” he said.\nLand experts like George McCarthy, head of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, heralded the technological advances of high-resolution land cover maps.\nBut he cautioned that such tools, created from public data, should not serve private interests in the way that companies have curated and sold information about publicly available land records.\n“There is a giant interest among the tech companies to figure out how they can package information and then monetise it,” he said.\n“Sooner or later, we should be ready and concerned about any efforts to privatize the data commons.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Geographic Information System (GIS) errors as it discusses the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve land-cover maps.

A chance find of 82 old paper maps presented it with the challenge of sharing that historical record with its residents too.\n\"I was looking through a storage area on one of the floors in the offices here, it's like a large map chest, and I found 82 large A0 map sheets. They were in imperial scale; the equivalent metric scale would be about one to 1056, which gives you a very detailed overview, so you can see building outlines, the outline of the kerb line,\" says Stuart Carter, GIS manager at Southwark council.\nThe maps date from between 1936 and 1952 and were amended by the London county council between 1936 and 1952. They are now out of copyright and free to be published.\nThe series of maps are extensively annotated. Locations such as schools, public houses and hospitals are named, and industrial buildings are not only named but usually show the type of industry they were involved in as well - for example, pickling works, wire works, dye factory. Such information held by historic maps can have a modern use, helping local authorities to identify potential areas of pollution resulting from historic industrial activity that no longer appears on current maps.\n\"Let's say the council is considering a new water treatment works. There were lots of tanneries and some really heavy and polluting industry in the north of the borough in the 19th century. If someone was considering putting a water treatment plant in that location – obviously that's not going to happen – you would be able to look back and say, 'Hold on, maybe we shouldn't put that water treatment plant there because there's a potential for water contamination,'\" says Carter.\nThe maps are also proving valuable for legal disputes. \"There are cases where the people who look after [land title] data in the council would need to have a visual reference going back through the years if there's a legal argument over a piece of title,\" he adds.\nCarter believes the maps have a cultural and educational value too.\n\"They provide an interesting resource for local residents researching their family tree. Let's say you suspected that a great-grandfather was born on Old Kent Road but maybe that place has now been turned into a large industrial estate. If you went on to an old map and you've zoomed into that area, well, you could see the building that one of your ancestors came from. It's not making anyone any money, but if that helps someone doing family research, then I see that as useful,\" he says.\nHe worked with CDR Group, a Pitney Bowes partner, to scan in the maps ready to load on to the council's MapInfo web-based mapping software. CDR scanned each of the maps in 16m colours at a resolution of 300dpi using large format scanning equipment, then cropped each image to enable them to be linked together to generate a single seamless map.\n\"We discovered they would join together to create an entire view of the borough, which we didn't expect,\" says Carter.\nThe cropped images were further manipulated to produce a true rectilinear image and remove the distortions in the paper map that occur over time due to paper shrinkage or stretching due to handling.\nA further challenge was the reconciliation of the old and modern mapping systems. Modern Ordnance Survey mapping is based upon a Transverse Mercator projection, a set of mathematical rules designed to depict features on a 3D object onto a 2D object such as a computer screen. However, when the historic maps were surveyed, the Ordnance Survey used a Cassini projection.\nThe difference in projections leads to distortion when one set of maps is compared to another. What is a rectangle in a Cassini projection looks more like a parallelogram when viewed using a Mercator projection, for example.\nThe geographic position of each image was recorded so that when it is displayed in a GIS system, the image will appear in the correct position in relation to other modern mapping data.\n\"You could overlay the historic maps with modern data. So, for example, we've got data sets for conservation areas, so you could overlay the old maps with a boundary set showing the extents of modern conservation areas. There's another data set about listed buildings,\" says Carter.\nCarter has revisited the project as the maps that were uploaded successfully to the web were later affected by an update to the MapInfo platform. Once the update issues are ironed out he is looking at putting some old aerial maps up on the web and is exploring possibilities around the council's historic mapping activities.\nHe says: \"There could possibly be some commercial opportunities, where we would sell our scanned historic maps.\"\nThis article is published by Guardian Professional.

{"num":33,"Time":"10 October","Title":"Sikkim: Deadly Indian glacial lake flash flood exposes lack of warning system","Content":"Sikkim: Deadly Indian glacial lake flash flood exposes lack of warning system\nPublished\n10 October\nShare\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nREUTERS\nImage caption,\nA bus covered in debris following flash floods after a glacial lake burst in Sikkim\nBy Navin Singh Khadka\nEnvironment correspondent, BBC World Service\nA deadly flash flood in the north-east state of Sikkim shows why India urgently needs to install advanced early warning systems for its dangerous glacial lakes, experts say.\nAt least 70 people - including nine soldiers - have died, and more than 100 others are missing after South Lhonak, a glacial lake in the Himalayas, burst its banks last week.\nSuch outbursts - or the sudden release of water from a lake fed by a glacier - can be triggered by heavy rains, earthquakes or avalanches.\nAn early warning system can help authorities evacuate people in time and open the flood gates from dams downstream to minimise damage.\nAfter the Sikkim disaster, India's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) revealed that in early September it had surveyed two at-risk lakes in order to deploy early warning systems for real-time alerts in the event of glacial lake outbursts.\nOne of lakes surveyed was at South Lhonak, where some work for early warnings were initiated, the BBC has learnt.\nBut the flood just weeks later has made people question why there was no functioning early warning system in place already, especially since the lake has long been known to be dangerous.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nA power plant along the Teesta river was damaged due to the floods\nWhat caused the outburst at South Lhonak remains unclear. Some say it may have resulted from a cloudburst, while others say there was no such heavy concentrated rainfall.\nThey attribute the disaster to the failure of the moraines, characterised by loose boulders, rocks and soil at the edge of the glacial lake. Some have even linked it to an earthquake.\nSeveral studies had warned that there was a high possibility of South Lhonak lake flooding.\nThe lake's area had expanded more than 2.5 times in the past three decades because of a rapidly melting glacier that feeds it. In 2016, authorities drew out some of the lake's water to prevent it from overflowing. But an early warning system wasn't set up.\nPeople working at the Chungthang dam, which is downstream of the Teesta river and collapsed because of the flood, told local media that when they received orders to open the dam's floodgates it was too late - flood waters had already started hitting the infrastructure.\nExperts say global warming is causing glaciers to melt faster and this has led to an increase in the water levels of several Himalayan lakes.\nIt has also led to new lakes being formed or old lakes fusing together. These lakes have become dangerous as they could flood due to rockfalls, cloudbursts or avalanches.\nThe NDMA says it has plans \"to install early warning systems for real-time alerts at most of 56 at-risk glacial lakes in India\".\nKathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, which specialises in Himalayan hazards, estimates that up to 200 glacial lakes across the Himalayas are in a dangerous state. In other words, they could burst at any time, just like South Lhonak.\nSikkim alone has more than 700 small and large glacial lakes and experts say around 20 are at risk of bursting.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nREUTERS\nImage caption,\nSikkim has more than 700 small and large glacial lakes and experts say around 20 are at risk of bursting\nDhiren Shrestha, director of Sikkim's science and technology department, confirmed that Lhonak was being monitored and was identified as dangerous. But he did not reply to the BBC's questions about why the lake didn't have an early warning system and how warnings had been issued to settlements and key buildings downstream after the lake begin to flood.\nNone of India's other federal agencies, including the NDMA, the Central Water Commission or Ministry of Water Resources responded to these questions either.\nSwitzerland has been helping the NDMA install an early-warning system in South Lhonak. Its embassy in Delhi did not provide the BBC with details or explain why the work was taking so long.\n\"Perhaps the lack of an early warning system has to do with bureaucracy and also the fact that several national and international agencies are involved in this work [setting up the system],\" Rajeev Rajak, a glaciology student at Sikkim University, said.\nSome campaigners who have been protesting against the construction of dams on rivers originating in the Himalayas said that South Lhonak lake was sensitive from a defence point of view and this may have slowed down the setting up of a warning system.\n\"The lake is in the region that borders China's autonomous region of Tibet, and that certainly entails military sensitivities which means any non-military work will take time,\" a campaigner, who didn't want to be named, said.\nBut glaciologists say global warming-induced changes are happening very fast in the Himalayas and require constant monitoring and risk-mitigating actions.\n\"We are running out of time,\" Miriam Jackson, a senior cryosphere specialist with the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), said.\n\"And there is so much to do including monitoring of the lakes, installing early warning systems, getting the local communities involved and checking if the equipment for monitoring and issuing early warning are maintained,\" she added.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nPRO DEFENCE GUWAHATI\nImage caption,\nRescue operations are underway to save stranded tourists and locals\nMeanwhile, the number of factors that make glacial lakes dangerous have increased with the climate becoming warmer.\nTraditionally, fast-melting glaciers rapidly filling up glacial lakes were mostly seen as the main problem. But thinning and retreating glaciers have also increasingly meant that the geography of the place becomes unstable, resulting in rockfalls and avalanches.\nScientists say that rising temperatures, leading to rains at higher altitudes where it mostly snowed in the past, are causing geological instability in mountainous regions worldwide, including the Himalayas.\nWarming also means thawing of permafrost (land which otherwise remains permanently frozen on mountains) which can lead to slope failures (a slope collapses abruptly due to rain or other factors) that can then cause glacial lakes to flood.\n\"There's evidence that the slope that caused the South Lhonak to flood moved faster than it has in years,\" says Jakob Steiner, a researcher with ICIMOD.\n\"Scientists are now looking at slope failures (via satellite images) across all lakes mapping all slopes around all lakes and checking how many of them have moved exceptionally (fast).\"\nBut all that monitoring will only be of use if there are early warning systems in place for when a glacial lake bursts - like South Lhonak did last week.\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

But their primary concern was getting their hands on a smartphone.\nThe 35-year-old Venezuelan migrant had found out in Tapachula, a city close to the Mexico-Guatemala border, that people hoping to enter the US to ask for asylum needed to secure an appointment through a recently introduced mobile phone app known as CBP One.\nThe app only works on smartphones and, to his dismay, Quintero had lost his phone during the harrowing trek across Panama’s Darién Gap, a roadless jungle on the Colombia-Panama border where tens of thousands of migrants heading north have risked their lives in the past year.\nMore than a week after working intermittently at a supermarket in Ciudad Juárez, Quintero earned enough money to buy a phone for 2,000 Mexican pesos, the equivalent of $114 (£90) . Initially, the family viewed the phone as their key to enter the US. But it soon became the main source of their frustration.\nEl Paso braces for end of pandemic-era rules restricting migration from Mexico\nRead more\n“We woke up early every day and tried to get an appointment, but we only got errors, errors and errors,” Quintero said, while flashing a screenshot of a “System Error” message above the US Customs and Border Protection logo. His wife and two young daughters patiently sat next to him.\n“We were desperate because we had no money and no food. So we surrendered ourselves at gate 36 of the border wall in El Paso.”\nA month later, Quintero was 700 miles (1,125km) west, knocking on the metal door of Espacio Migrante, a migrant shelter in Tijuana, hoping to find out whether he was still eligible for a CBP One appointment.\nAfter crossing into the US near El Paso, he and his family were detained by the US border patrol, flown to California and expelled back across the Mexican border to Tijuana.\nThere, Quintero had seen on social media that lawyers from the Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), a social justice law firm based in Los Angeles that serves immigrants facing deportation, were giving a legal workshop at the shelter, to help asylum seekers.\nAsylum in the US should not be dependent on whether or not your phone has the software updated\nLindsay Toczylowski of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center\n“The government created this app and said that this is the only way for people to access the asylum system, while people here in Tijuana are fleeing their traffickers, or some other kind of danger. And if they don’t have a phone, they’re unable to access protection,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, executive director of ImmDef, adding: “Asylum in the US should not be dependent on whether or not your phone has the software updated.”\nAt noon, when Espacio Migrante opened its doors, at least 100 people, including Haitians, Venezuelans and Salvadorans, came in search of answers about CBP One.\nThe lawyers described the process for getting an appointment, but also explained that the chances of actually getting one were often slim, given the high demand and limited spots.\nMigrants use the CBP One app in a shelter near the border, in Ciudad Juarez in February. Photograph: José Luis González\/Reuters\nThere was palpable confusion and anxiety among those gathered inside the shelter. The workshop came amid another phase of the intensifying humanitarian crisis in northern Mexico, where tens of thousands of people desperately fleeing violence, biting poverty and oppression in their home countries are hoping to cross into the US – with a coveted CBP One appointment or a change in policy.\nAt one minute to midnight on 11 May, the US will discontinue the obscure public health measure known as Title 42, implemented during the coronavirus pandemic by Donald Trump and continued, amid court battles, under Joe Biden.\nTitle 42 has allowed the federal authorities to summarily expel migrants back across the US-Mexico border – 2.7m times under the Biden administration alone – without allowing them to exercise their right to claim asylum.\nThe US government has projected that daily unauthorized border crossings could more than double to as many as 13,000 once such expulsions are halted, and is sending troops to support the border patrol. Fears of fresh chaos and misery abound, in contrast to Joe Biden’s campaign pledges of fairer and smoother systems.\nJust hours before the legal presentation started at the Espacio Migrante shelter, the Biden administration unveiled its strategy to deter migration when Title 42 ends. Officials announced they would open processing centers in Colombia and Guatemala in a bid to encourage migrants to wait there for a chance to enter the US or a third country legally, as opposed to illegally crossing the US-Mexico border – or just turning up at border crossings to claim asylum without an appointment.\nThe US government has also been working on a highly controversial measure that would bar migrants from asylum if they enter the country illegally after failing to seek humanitarian protection in a third country they transited on their journey north.\n‘If they don’t have a phone, they’re unable to access protection,’ said Lindsay Toczylowski of ImmDef. Photograph: José Luis González\/Reuters\nWhen Title 42 ends, the US will revert to using the law known as Title 8. The government plans speedy processing of asylum seekers at the border, prompting immigrant advocates to complain that the process will be unfairly hasty. Deportation will be the result for many migrants, who are already in dire straits – with the Biden administration accused by progressives of hewing too closely to Trump’s hardline approach.\nIn Tijuana, migrants last week were unsure about how a dizzying array of Biden administration policy changes in recent weeks and months could affect them. Most who spoke to the Guardian were focused on obtaining an appointment to apply for asylum and receiving a CBP One confirmation email. Problems with the app have been well-documented, including families not being able to get appointments together.\nSign up to Headlines US\nFree newsletter\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We don’t have freedom of speech,” he said.\nAnd the Guardian has reported that many other vulnerable migrants, including those with darker skin tones, haven’t been able to register to secure an appointment, despite daily attempts.\nTowards the end of the lawyers’ presentation, another Venezuelan family sat outside the shelter, seeking shade in the strong sunshine. Marlin Fernández, 28, and Enders Pérez, 29, and their three daughters had been staying at the shelter since 29 March, after living in Tapachula for six months.\nFernández said that many women she met in Tapachula told her they had been sexually abused while on their way to northern Mexico, the only area where migrants can secure a CBP One appointment, due to a geographic limit imposed by the US. As they were traversing Mexico, Fernández said, a masked man entered the bus they were traveling on and took all their money.\nBut the family pushed onward to Tijuana, which they had heard was relatively safe compared to other Mexican border cities beset by cartel violence.\nIt was also the area where US officials were processing some of the highest numbers of asylum seekers.\nMigrants seeking asylum wait outside the building of the National Institute of Migration as they queue to request a permit to travel to another point of entry to the US, in Ciudad Juarez. Photograph: José Luis González\/Reuters\nEnrique Lucero, director of Tijuana’s office of migrant affairs, said that more than 16,000 migrants in Tijuana have secured CBP One appointments so far, or roughly 200 each day. About 6,600 of them were Russians. Haitians and Venezuelans have received the second- and third-highest number of appointments, Lucero said.\nFernández and Pérez desperately wanted to make it to the US, but they said they would like to do it the “right way”. But trying to do so was proving an ordeal.\n“Something was wrong with my photo. Every time I tried, it just froze,” Fernández said, while breastfeeding her youngest daughter. “But one day my photo was saved, but then it showed an error [message]. I pressed ‘send’ again and received the same error message. I pressed ‘send’ again many times until it worked.”\nFernández and Pérez jumped and celebrated, but when the confirmation email arrived in Fernández’s inbox, they were confused. She and her family were asked to arrive at 6am on 3 May at the port of entry connecting Matamoros in Mexico with Brownsville, Texas – a crossing almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) away at the other end of the US-Mexico border.\n“The night we got the appointments, a group of people arrived here from Matamoros and told us they were asked to leave the bus they were traveling in and that one of the passengers was kidnapped,” said Fernández.\nBut they couldn’t afford to fly to Matamoros. Broke and scared but determined, they chose a 20-hour bus ride there, saying: “We’ve heard that all shelters are full. Hopefully we don’t end up sleeping in the street.”\nThe family ended up entering the US and into the legal process. They were also given an immigration court date in October.\nOn their first night on US soil, Fernández met a Mexican woman who offered for the family to sleep at her home. Unable to cover the traveling expenses to New York City, their intended final destination, ImmDef provided them with bus tickets to San Antonio, Texas, where they will be placed in a shelter.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Geographic Information System (GIS) errors because it discusses the challenges faced by migrants in using a mobile phone app called CBP One to secure appointments for asylum claims at the US-Mexico border.

{"num":34,"Time":"Wed 22 Mar 2017 07.00 CET","Title":"Why denying refugees the right to work is a catastrophic error","Content":"F\nrom the 1980s on, a dominant international approach has been taken towards the majority of the world’s refugees. Concentrated in a small number of host countries, close to war zones, displaced people have been settled in what have become known as “humanitarian silos”. Such places are usually remote, arid, dangerous and almost always have strict prohibitions on socio-economic activity. They are designed to deal only with the emergency phase of refugee intake, and yet the model has endured, leaving individuals and families stranded for years at a time.\nThis strategy undermines autonomy and dignity. It also erodes human potential by focusing almost exclusively on people’s vulnerabilities, rather than on rebuilding their lives. Inevitably, many of those directly affected by it become disillusioned and choose to move on, gravitating towards urban areas in the host nation or risking their lives crossing oceans to other countries.\nWe need to rethink the humanitarian silo. What are the key rights that refugees are entitled to? The overarching right is to protection for the duration of the risk that they are fleeing. But since refuge typically lasts for years, this cannot be sufficient. Refugees have a right to expect a pathway to autonomy. Another distinctive right of refugees is that of return, or integration elsewhere, depending upon the duration of the conflict. For conflicts that persist, integration into another society is necessary: people cannot be left in permanent limbo.\nBut integration is not a simple solution. Rich countries are becoming less reliable as places for mass refuge. There has been a polarisation of politics. The right has become more rightwing, the left more leftwing and the centre ground has been decimated. In Europe, the far right is on the rise. Then there is Donald Trump as US president. Across the entire political spectrum, there has been a lurch towards nativism, and populist nationalism has become the common currency of democratic politics. Isolated terrorist attacks have repeatedly been used to repudiate the right to asylum in Europe.\nThe challenge now is to consider ways to address alienation and fear. Politicians face the dilemma of how to reconcile democracy and refuge in ways that can take majoritarian politics with them. Opinion polls tell us that public concern about asylum is not about numbers; it is about a perceived loss of control.\nIt makes sense to protect most refugees close to home. After all, nearly 90% of the world’s refugees are in countries that neighbour their homeland – nations such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Uganda, Kenya, Iran and Pakistan. However, countries that border war zones are often in need themselves, and ill-equipped to bear such responsibilities. A new, much more supportive approach to safe havens is urgently needed in order to address this imbalance.\nThe Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, home to tens of thousands of Syrian refugees. Photograph: Mandel Ngan\/AFP\/Getty Images\nIn principle, when refugees flee a crisis, they receive initial emergency assistance and are then offered a pathway to reintegration into normal life. In practice, however, the default long-term response to refugees has become to create an indefinite dependency on aid. The imagined needs of refugees have been reduced to two basics – food and shelter – and it has become assumed that the most viable way to provide such rights is through camps.\nIt was not meant to be this way. Refugee-intake strategies were originally intended to promote access to autonomy, with particular focus on the right to work and freedom of movement. These rights are in the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees. But since the global shift towards encampment that began in the 1980s, these rights have not been implemented.\nWith the option to shift long-term responsibility on to the international humanitarian aid system, host states have invariably restricted refugees’ participation in labour markets. The denial of the right to work has had catastrophic consequences for many refugees, leading to a long-term erosion of skills and aspirations, and often exacerbating a sense of alienation and hopelessness. It has left refugees less able to contribute to their host states or to eventually rebuild their own societies, should they eventually return home. In Kenya’s Dadaab camps, for instance, many of the 350,000 Somali refugees have been there since the early 1990s – and none have the right to work.\nIf our duty is to restore the lives of displaced people to something as close to normality as possible, reestablishing their autonomy should be high on the agenda. One of the most important components of autonomy is the right to earn a living.\nRarely have economists thought about refugees. The dominant assumption has been that they are a humanitarian matter, and so studies have been led by lawyers and anthropologists. However, the truth is that refugees around the world lead complex and diverse economic lives. They are consumers, producers, buyers, sellers, borrowers, lenders and entrepreneurs. Faced with new markets, regulatory contexts and social networks, they are often highly innovative, coming up with creative ways to support themselves. A recent study commissioned by the Refugee Studies Centre in Oxford and conducted in Uganda – one of few nations that allows refugees to work – shows that they can make a contribution. In Kampala, the nation’s capital, 21% of refugees run a business that employs at least one other person; of those they employ, 40% are citizens of the host country.\nRefugee camps are not the answer to a complex crisis\nRead more\nRefugees bring diverse skills and talents; they usually represent a random sample of their home country’s population. As people, rather than “victims”, refugees are not economically different from anyone else. The only thing that makes the economic lives of refugees distinct from those of citizens or other migrants is the regulation that affects whether or not they can participate fully in the economy.\nIn restrictive countries, refugees are often denied the right to own certain types of property, their contracts may not be enforced, and there may be restrictions on mobility and the right to work. These kinds of institutional differences create immense challenges for refugees but they do not extinguish economic life. On the contrary, they explain the emergence of particular forms of informal economic activity.\nRefugees and nationals frequently interact in ad hoc markets at the boundaries of camps and settlements. Illicit markets for goods, services, and labour spring up even when suppressed. SIM cards, handsets and World Food Programme food rations are bought and sold. Almost any item or service can still be procured if the price is right. There may be winners from these distortions, notably brokers and intermediaries. Certain forms of economic activity will thrive, including hawking and vending. Some refugees and even more nationals will accumulate capital in these highly regulated refugee situations.\nPreventing refugees from participating fully in the economy is inefficient. Even a miniature refugee-only economy, kept separate from the national economy around it, will inflict needless losses on both. This is because the scope for specialisation and exchange is reduced. These economic losses will be exacerbated by the effect heavy regulation has in suppressing normal and productive economic activity. By creating situations in which there are extreme differences in market power between those who control opportunities and desperate individuals who seek them, we are more likely to leave people open to exploitation.\nIt makes economic sense to begin to break down arbitrary boundaries to refugees’ economic participation. But, as it turns out, many of the barriers to achieving this are political.\nW\ne need to change how we think about refugees’ needs. How can we move from a focus on vulnerabilities towards recognising and building their capacities? Rather than seeing refugees as an inevitable burden, how can we find ways in which they can be a benefit? Instead of being viewed as just passive victims of humanitarian disaster, how might they be seen as potential agents of development?\nThis requires a vision. There have been far too few good examples of refugees being given access to autonomy and jobs. Jordan has pioneered de facto “experiments” in refugee policy that deviate markedly from the dominant norm of long-term humanitarian aid.\nJordan has been profoundly affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. Its initial response to refugees was largely typical of host countries around the world; the government of Jordan faced severe policy constraints. But it is also a country whose refugee policies matter a great deal to the rest of the world: bordered by Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Israel, Jordan represents a rare island of stability within an insecure region. It has historically shown immense generosity towards refugees, welcoming and integrating Circassians, Armenians, Palestinians and Iraqis over several decades. The UNHCR estimates that Jordan currently hosts more than 600,000 Syrian refugees, although the government contests this figure and suggests it may be more than 1 million – this in a country whose own population is just 6.5 million.\nA minority of the refugees are in camps such as Zaatari, Azraq and Zarqa, within which they are effectively “warehoused”, with limited economic autonomy and high levels of dependency on international assistance. By contrast, 83% of Jordan’s refugees are in urban areas, with the highest number in the capital, Amman, and others in Irbid and Mafraq. They have voted with their feet: while urban refugees have access to higher levels of autonomy, they relinquish access to most forms of international assistance. Furthermore, while most subsist via the informal economy, few are able to access formal work permits, either because they are prohibitively expensive or because of the restrictive bureaucratic process.\nA shoe seller in the Zaatari refugee camp, where most people subsist via the informal economy, because they are unable to access formal work permits. Photograph: Muhammad Hamed \/ Reuters\/Reuters\nThe international response is premised upon the same default logic that characterises the entire refugee regime. Donors write cheques to support humanitarian relief and host countries of first asylum are expected to provide the territory on which the refugees are hosted. Less than 3% of the total Syrian refugee population has received resettlement to countries outside the region. As with other neighbouring countries, this places a considerable strain on Jordan. When pushed to offer greater economic participation to refugees, Jordan has generally responded with two big concerns, relating to development and security.\nOne concern relates to competition for economic resources. In particular, Jordanians are worried about competition for jobs, downward pressure on wages, upward pressure on house prices, and the depletion of natural resources such as water. Although recent studies show that Syrian refugees have had a negligible effect on Jordanian labour markets, there is still concern.\nThe key concern, though, is national security. The large concentration of Syrians in cities creates a variety of anxieties, not least the problems that could arise with large numbers of young men with limited long-term economic opportunity. The perceived risk has increased as Syrian refugees deplete the savings and capital they brought with them. The timing of Jordan’s decision to close its border with Syria in September 2014, for example, coincided directly with a spike in Islamic State-related displacement from July 2014 onwards; ultimately, the fear of radicalisation and terrorist infiltration concerns the Jordanian government more than the labour-market implications do.\nThe result is a policy characterised by stasis. Most Syrian refugees are in urban areas, but are forced to subsist in the informal economy while their children remain out of school. A minority are in camps and dependent on international aid. Tens of thousands more are trapped on the other side of the Jordan-Syria border in a demilitarised zone known as the “berm”. Meanwhile, the international community is effectively stuck in a holding pattern, delivering aid while hoping the war in Syria will come to an end. It is hardly surprising that many young Syrians in the country see their only remaining routes to change as travelling onward to Europe or returning to Syria to fight.\nThe policy challenge in Jordan, and around the world, is to address the development and security concerns of the host country while empowering refugees. There are no easy answers. But there may be a solution that can simultaneously benefit Jordan, enable refugees and enhance security in the region. It lies in a particular approach to job creation.\nO\nne finds pockets of extraordinary resilience and innovation among the Syrian refugee community in Jordan. In the Zaatari refugee camp, home to around 80,000 Syrians, there is no right to work and all economic activity is supposed to be highly regulated by the government. But creativity abounds. The bustling main market street known as the Shams-Élysées – a play on words that references the Paris shopping district and the historic name for Syria – is lined with shops and small businesses. Despite strict access controls at the entrance to the camp, seemingly every product imaginable – from cosmetics to textiles to pharmaceuticals to pets – can be purchased here.\nInnovation is on display in other ways. All refugee households are given a caravan, usually made from an old shipping container, to live in. Yet many of these caravans are reconverted: they might be moved across the camp, become shops along the Shams-Élysées or converted into furniture. A black-market construction trade smuggles bricks and cement into the camp, enabling further upgrades and extensions. Across the camp, one finds endless illustrations of inventiveness and entrepreneurship: urban gardening, striking murals and community-led journalism, to name just a few.\nWhile some of this informal activity is tolerated, most is formally prohibited and selectively dismantled. The Jordanian police make occasional raids to shut down some forms of business, either because they have become too large, or for more vindictive reasons. Meanwhile, irrational contradictions pervade camp life: hundreds of Jordanian teachers are employed at great expense to teach Syrian children according to the Jordanian national curriculum, while hundreds of qualified Syrian teachers are left idle. The suppression and neglect of skills, talents and aspirations benefits nobody. What if instead refugees were allowed to join the labour market?\nShops along the ‘Shamps-Élysées’ in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. Economic activity is supposed to be highly regulated here, but creativity abounds. Photograph: Thomson Reuters Foundation\nJust a 15-minute drive from the Zaatari camp in Jordan, there is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) – an area in which business and trade laws differ from the rest of the country, in order to attract trade, investment and job creation. It is called the King Hussein bin Talal Development Area (KHBTDA). The government has invested £100m into connecting it to the national road network and economic grid. However, despite having a few factories, in 2015 it was operating well below capacity. It lacked two key things: workers and business investment. What might be the potential if refugees were allowed to work alongside Jordanian nationals in the economic zone? This might offer a way to simultaneously benefit refugees, contribute to Jordan’s own national-development strategy, and incubate the post-conflict recovery in Syria.\nFor a country such as Jordan, refugees arguably represent an opportunity for a transition to manufacturing. They are a potential source of labour. Syrians, for example, are often skilled and well educated, and share a language with Jordanians. Crucially, international recognition of a regional refugee crisis creates a potential opportunity for the government of Jordan to appeal for the relocation of a number of multinational corporations to Jordan, for reasons that partly connect to corporate social responsibility and partly to core business interests. The crisis also offers a basis on which the government could appeal to other governments – in, say, Europe or North America – to provide trade concessions that improve access to their markets.\nA range of external actors might support the creation of such economic zones for refugees. For example, EU trade concessions, which are conditional on providing refugees with the right to work, might be available to businesses operating within the designated areas. Syrian businesses no longer able to operate in Syria could be encouraged to relocate to such zones, assuming they were eventually able to return. Among these businesses are multinational corporations such as American Express, Sony Corporation and Caterpillar, as well as many Syrian companies.\nInnovation at Zaatari: how do refugees make tents and caravans into homes?\nRead more\nSEZs often have a bad reputation, being associated with exploitative, low-wage labour. But there is no reason why the model could not be adapted to ensure respect for human rights and ethical practice. The core of the idea would be to allow economic zoning that creates geographical spaces within which refugees receive access to a set of entitlements and capabilities. Crucially, the model should not function on the basis of any kind of coercion, but offer opportunities sufficiently concrete to attract refugees to work within and live close to these spaces. They should be premised upon possibilities that enhance refugee choice and autonomy.\nA key part of this model is that it would contribute to post-conflict reconstruction. Ideally, many of the businesses developed within such spaces would be footloose, enabling them to follow refugees back to Syria when the security situation allows, and thereby play a key role in political and economic transition. The model would not depend upon the end of insecurity within Syria, but could be based on the idea of working towards an eventual post-conflict reconstruction, rather than feeding into a narrative of “local integration”. In that sense, it would be a model that works directly to enhance refugees’ autonomy, to meet Jordan’s concerns about national development and regional security, and to support rebuilding in the new Syria.\nT\nhese initial ideas have since gained political traction, and have begun to be implemented. The trigger for international interest came during David Cameron’s visit to Jordan and Lebanon in September 2015. His visit immediately followed an outpouring of public support for refugees after the image of a drowned three-year-old boy, Alan Kurdi, went viral after appearing on the front page of newspapers across Europe. It prompted the UK government to initiate a resettlement scheme for Syrian refugees, providing official transport direct from the haven countries so that they need not take their chances with the people-smugglers. While in Amman, Cameron had met King Abdullah, who suggested the idea to him.\nIn January 2016 at Davos, the forum for global business, Queen Rania of Jordan acclimatised CEOs to the idea that corporate social responsibility to refugees did not mean diverting some profits into sending blankets; rather, it meant putting their core skills to use by integrating them into global supply chains. In the context of emerging business interest in solutions to the refugee crisis, a range of manufacturing company CEOs began to take notice. The formal launch of the pilot project came as part of the London conference on Syrian refugees on 4 February 2016. The basic deal on the table – called the Jordan Compact – was that Jordan would receive around $2bn (£1.6bn) in assistance and investment. In exchange, it would offer up to 200,000 work permits to Syrians. One of the main vehicles for this would be through a series of five new SEZs, in which refugees would be employed alongside Jordanian nationals, partly building upon existing development areas.\nDavid Cameron visiting a refugee camp in Lebanon in September 2015, after which the Jordan Compact, a scheme to allow more work permits for refugees, was launched. Photograph: WPA\/Getty\nOver the next few months, the governments of Jordan and the UK, together with the World Bank, led the negotiation of a partnership to flesh out the details of the Jordan Compact and to carry the pilot forward. The UK has provided convening power and funding. The World Bank has offered concessional loan-based finance. But the most crucial component has been the unprecedented commitment of the European Union to providing trade concessions for particular products exported from the SEZs. In particular, it agreed that concessions would be initially offered in the garment sector, an industry in which many Syrians specialised in places that have come under relentless bombardment, such as Homs.\nThe deal represents a new kind of partnership: one that involves governments and businesses working together; one that cuts across old silos and situates solutions for refugees at the intersection between development, trade and security. Crucially, it is built upon a recognition that if areas of mutual gain can be identified, hosting refugees can become an opportunity rather than just an inevitable cost. European governments want to address a migration crisis; Jordan wants to make the leap to manufacturing and manage a security nightmare; business is seeking a new investment opportunity, while also trying to restore respect for modern capitalism; refugees want to work; and just about everyone has a stake in the long-term future of Syria. By linking these concerns, the approach offers scope for everyone to benefit, and so provides a more realistic possibility of moving the needle for refugees than the past model of pious exhortation ever did.\nG\nlobalisation can be a menacing and disruptive force, but it can also be a powerful one for good. At its best, it brings earning opportunities to people in places where previously they were largely absent. Refugees, separated from their prior livelihoods and often clinging to the lowest rung of the economic ladder in their host societies, need this power of globalisation more than any other group.\nBut how feasible in practice is it to bring global opportunities to Syrian refugees? In the context of Angela Merkel’s famous “wir schaffen das” speech, Germany received far more Syrian refugees than any other country in Europe. Superficially, the half a million Syrians who have moved to Germany would appear to be in the best position. But to date this has not been so, according to the German Federal Employment Agency, which reports a less than 10% employment rate for the new arrivals. It is hoped that this will change over time, but the employment record for Syrian refugees in Germany so far is undoubtedly unimpressive. This outcome is not surprising, given that Germany’s distinctive place in global production is entirely ill-suited to refugees from a poor country.\nProduction for global markets in Germany has specialised in highly skilled tasks that require years of training. The German system of training, envied around the world, integrates the last years of schooling with the early years of employment. Refugees cannot readily be parachuted into this system. Further, reflecting the high average level of skill, Germany’s minimum wage is far, far higher than wages in Syria, which reflected average levels of productivity of Syrian workers: per capita incomes in Germany are around 20 times higher than those in pre-conflict Syria. Consequently, inserting Syrian refugees based in Germany into the global economy is going to be difficult. They are more likely to end up in domestic-service positions created for them in the public sector, such as the post office. Even here they face difficulties: a refugee who applied for a job cleaning toilets was ultimately rejected by the local Bureau of Employment on the grounds that “a native-born German could do the same job”. By that criterion, many of the refugees invited to Germany will continue to languish in unemployment.\nConnecting the refugees in the regional haven countries is likely to be easier. Paradoxically, German firms may find it easier to generate jobs for refugees in the regional havens than to integrate them into their German-based activity. This is because German firms have pioneered modern globalisation. The world’s top authority on this recent form of globalisation is economist Richard Baldwin. As he explains, since the 1990s globalisation has not been about shifting production to China; it has been about relocating some tasks that are still done within the same firm to cheaper sites. These sites cannot be thousands of miles from the main factory, because production on both sites must be controlled as an integrated process. For example, managers must be able to fly between them in a day. It is not only distance that matters: if the “foetus” factory is to be linked by an umbilical cord to the parent factory, there must be no regulatory impediments.\nTrade barriers between the country of the parent and the country of the foetus would be a killer. In the 1990s, the preferred sites for German manufacturing firms were in Poland: very close and much cheaper than Germany, and a member of the EU and so barrier-free. German firms are not alone in this – the same model has been developed by US and Japanese firms – but they are Europe’s leading practitioners. US firms have some tasks undertaken in Mexico, while Japanese firms offshore some work to China.\nBut, as in China itself, as German production shifted to Poland, wages rose and so firms started to look a little further afield. During the past decade, the preferred location has been Turkey. Turkey is further away than Poland, but still the “near offshore”: if refugees can walk it, German managers can certainly fly it. And although Turkey is not in the EU, it has privileged status for trade purposes. The EU lets goods produced in Turkey enter duty-free. Turkey has indeed been growing explosively as a result of breaking into global markets for manufacturing. To give an example, within the last decade a nowhere town in central Turkey, not even on the coast, has developed into the dominant global centre of production for synthetic carpets.\nA Syrian boy helping shop owners at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. Photograph: Ammar Awad\/Reuters\nIf German firms can offshore to Turkey, in principle they can do so in all three haven countries. Turkey’s big advantage was its privileged market access to Europe. Both Turkey and Jordan have many industrial zones in which refugees could potentially work alongside nationals. This, of course, requires that the governments of the haven countries permit refugees to work in the zones. The international deal to which the government of Jordan agreed at the London conference in February 2016 included a commitment by the Jordanian government to provide work permits for refugees in return for new jobs being created in the zones: hence the vital role that international business can play in bringing dignity to refugees’ lives. The government of Jordan committed to 50,000 work permits in the following 12 months. It is on track to achieve this target, with more than 30,000 permits so far allocated, but the critical question is whether international business will generate enough jobs.\nIt might seem as though setting up production in a haven country industrial zone would require years of preparation. But global business does not work to such a glacial timescale. In Mexico, one US firm succeeded in going from zero to production in six weeks. Even the relocation of footwear production from China to Ethiopia took only a few months. A lot can happen in a year if CEOs take the issue seriously.\nNor does the generation of jobs for refugees depend entirely, or even primarily, on manufacturing firms opening new factories in the havens. All the main haven countries for Syrians are already middle-income economies, with many firms, international and domestic, producing goods that can be supplied to global marketing chains. The key companies might not be those engaged in global production, but in global retailing. For example, Asda investigated the scope for routing some of its orders to the zones in the havens, in return for commitments by suppliers to hire refugees. It found that this was feasible: now some of the products that British consumers are buying in their local Asda stores have been made by refugees.\nGlobalisation can work for Syrian refugees, but can it work at the required scale? The jobs created by foreign firms – both those that establish new production units and those that buy from firms already in the havens – generate other jobs: there is a multiplier. The incomes earned by these new workers get spent on services and food produced domestically.\nSyrian refugees in Jordan: 'If they cut the coupons, we will probably die'\nRead more\nInternational business can make a real difference to the life chances of refugees, but governments can make a decisive difference by catalysing the process. Following the London conference, David Cameron brought a whole-government approach to making it happen. He appointed a special envoy, Patricia Morris, to bring in the private sector, and Britain’s business secretary, Sajid Javid, flew with a group of CEOs to Jordan. That is how the Asda commitment came about. Other European leaders were too preoccupied with either trying to offload thousands of invited refugees to their neighbours, or resisting European Commission directives ordering them to do so, to focus on generating jobs for the millions of refugees remaining in the havens.\nEvery approach should involve promoting empowerment through the right to work, the role of public-private partnership, and the recognition that refugees need to be understood as much in terms of development and trade as humanitarianism, and that deals should be based on the principle of mutual gain.\nWhile the Jordanian SEZ pilot focuses on a middle-income country aspiring to increase its manufacturing base, the basic logic of “development areas” – whether based on integration or incubation – could also be applied to countries that are seeking to build different economic sectors. Depending on whether one is seeking to promote economic participation in manufacturing, agricultural or information economies, the model and partnerships required for success will vary.\nRefugee protection is not the same as immigration. Its purpose is to provide people with their full set of rights until they are able to go home or be integrated elsewhere. Nevertheless, with creativity this can be done in ways that promote human flourishing and simultaneously benefit host countries by supporting their development strategies, particularly within underdeveloped border areas. But the potential of this new approach extends beyond refuge. It can be made to serve another purpose, too: helping to restore stability to countries such as Syria once the conflicts are over.\nThis is an edited extract from Refuge: Transforming a Broken Refugee System by Alexander Betts and Paul Collier, published by Allen Lane.\nFollow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news article discusses the denial of the right to work for refugees, which is a relevant issue related to Geographic Information System (GIS) errors.

Police think he could have had as many as 600 victims.\nGrant's arrest in November 2009 has been described as a fine example of good old-fashioned policing. But Grant could and should have been caught 10 years earlier.\nA member of the public spotted a car at a burglary in Bromley in May 1999, noted down the number plate and informed police.\nThe car was traced through driver records at the DVLA to Delroy Grant from south London.\nBut Grant was never arrested or even spoken to.\nAn Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation found this extraordinary lapse was due to basic policing errors and a mix-up over identity.\nWhen police got the name \"Delroy Grant\" from the DVLA, officers were distracted from what should have been a routine inquiry when a search of their own computer system, the PNC, revealed a listing for a man with a similar name.\nSpoke to wife\nBy coincidence, his DNA profile happened to be on the national database. When it was compared to DNA samples left at various crime scenes there was no match.\nPolice then went to Delroy Grant's home in south London but their inquiries weren't thorough enough.\nAn officer spoke to his wife and she confirmed that the suspect car seen near the burglary did belong to them. But, inexplicably, police never went back to speak to Grant himself.\nImage caption,\nGrant was arrested at his home in Brockley, south-east London\nIn August 1999 Delroy Grant, from south London, the Night Stalker, was eliminated from police inquiries.\nGrant went on to commit a further 146 offences after the blunder in 1999, including two rapes and 20 sexual assaults.\nCommander Simon Foy, from the Metropolitan Police, said the force apologised for the \"missed opportunity\".\n\"We are deeply sorry for the harm suffered by all the other victims,\" he said.\nFollowing the IPCC investigation, two detective constables have been disciplined by being given management advice.\nIn 2001, police received another potential clue that might have led them to Grant.\nA caller to Crimestoppers said an e-fit of the offender resembled a man in a children's home, named Delroy Grant.\nPolice now say they do not regard this as a missed opportunity because the information they were given at the time was sketchy - the caller said the e-fit also looked like someone else.\nSince Grant's arrest, officers have seen no evidence he was cared for or worked in a children's home and the home itself has been destroyed in a fire, making it hard to retrieve records.\nBut both near-misses, in 1999 and 2001, raise questions about Operation Minstead, the operation to catch the Night Stalker.\nOn the wrong track\nCriminal profiler Professor David Canter, from the University of Huddersfield, said \"incompetent policing\" often played a part in serial offending.\n\"It's not really some sort of great criminal mind that carries out crimes over and over again without getting caught, it's really the lack of effectiveness, of the police, in being able to identify the individual especially in the early days when in a sense he's still learning his trade,\" he said.\nOne piece of information which appears to have put police on the wrong track during their inquiry was the suggestion that the Night Stalker rode a motorbike.\nIn a public appeal in 2006, Scotland Yard said this was one of his \"significant characteristics\".\nDetectives say the motorbike theory emerged because one burglary victim heard a noisy, throaty engine roar after the offender left the premises.\nHowever, police now say there is no evidence Grant owned a motorbike. Police say he did have an American Trans Am-type car, which could have made a similar noise.\nDuring the police inquiry four experts were deployed to help catch the Night Stalker - two behavioural experts, one geographical specialist and a clinical psychologist.\nTheir work - although useful in informing police about the driving forces and likely background of the offender - did not advance the investigation significantly.\nArguably, however, what sidetracked police more than anything during their inquiry was the quest to identify the offender's ancestry.\nDNA analysis showed that he originated from the Caribbean and that his relatives, going back five generations, were probably from the Windward Islands.\nAlthough this helped narrow down the pool of potential suspects from 26,000 to 6,000 it did not get police any closer to Grant, who was in fact born in Jamaica and was not on the list.\nCommander Foy defended this avenue of inquiry as \"entirely legitimate\" saying that it went to the \"edge of science\".\nBut in the end, Grant was caught by more basic police work: CCTV analysis of the suspect's car and an intensive surveillance operation involving 70 officers in the area where his offending began in 1992.\nMore on this story\nNight Stalker rapist found guilty\nPublished\n24 March 2011\nNight Stalker's reign of terror\nPublished\n24 March 2011\nTimeline: Night Stalker case\nPublished\n24 March 2011\nRelated Internet Links\nMetropolitan Police\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Geographic Information System errors as it discusses a missed opportunity to apprehend Delroy Grant, also known as the Night Stalker, who committed a series of sex attacks and burglaries across south London.

{"num":63,"Time":"Tue 26 Jul 2016 15.08 CEST","Title":"How an open data blogger proved the NYPD issued parking tickets in error","Content":"Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg once called the New York Police Department “the seventh biggest army in the world”. Whether or not that stat is true, there’s no doubt the NYPD is a large and powerful organisation – and, as current mayor Bill de Blasio learned last year, it does not always take criticism well.\nEnter Ben Wellington, a Brooklyn-based quantitative analyst who runs the storytelling-through-data website IQuantNY. The map above comes from a recent IQuantNY post examining New York City’s parking ticket data, which is freely available online. The red circles represent millions of dollars in erroneous parking tickets, issued by NYPD officers to vehicles that were in fact parked legally.\nThe rise and fall of great world cities: 5,700 years of urbanisation – mapped\nRead more\nBefore posting the analysis online, Wellington reached out to the NYPD to report his findings. A few weeks later he received the response below: a thoughtful, polite note from the NYPD acknowledging the error and listing the steps they’ve taken to correct it.\nMr Wellington’s analysis identified errors the department made in issuing parking summonses. It appears to be a misunderstanding by officers on patrol of a recent, abstruse change in the parking rules. We appreciate Mr Wellington bringing this anomaly to our attention.\nThe department’s internal analysis found that patrol officers who are unfamiliar with the change have observed vehicles parked in front of pedestrian ramps and issued a summons in error ... As a result, the department sent a training message to all officers clarifying the rule change and has communicated to commanders of precincts with the highest number of summonses, informing them of the issues within their command.\nThanks to this analysis and the availability of this open data, the department is also taking steps to digitally monitor these types of summonses to ensure that they are being issued correctly.\nIt’s incredible to consider that one person analysing numbers on their home computer has the power to influence an organisation as large and powerful as the NYPD, something successive mayors have struggled to do.\nAs Wellington said: “This is what Open Data is all about. This was coming from the NYPD, not generally celebrated for its transparency, and yet it’s the most open and honest response I have received from any New York City agency to date. Imagine a city where all agencies embrace this sort of analysis, instead of deflecting and hiding from it.”\nThe story certainly underscores the power of open government data. It also, perhaps, illustrates why some government agencies may be reluctant to open up their data for public inspection – and why public involvement is crucial in making sure they do.\nMapping microbes in the world’s subway systems\nLast year, researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine College used DNA samples from each of New York City’s subway stations to produce the city’s first pathogen map. Nearly half the DNA sequenced did not match any known organism, highlighting just how much we have yet to learn about the bacteria that subway commuters come into contact with every day.\nIn one of its most shared graphics of 2015, the Wall Street Journal used the study’s results to build an interactive map, which let New Yorkers explore their subway system and see exactly which pathogens were found in each station.\nVideo: the MetaSUB project\nSoon, 54 other cities around the world may be able to do the same. The team of researchers behind PathoMap have gathered together an international consortium of laboratories to conduct a similar analysis for subway systems around the world. The project, called MetaSUB (Metagenomics and Metadesign of the Subways and Urban Biomes), kicked off last month with a Global City Sampling Day: with the help of “citizen scientists”, the event brought in more than 4,000 DNA samples worldwide.\nWith billions of people passing through the world’s subways each year, MetaSUB aims to improve our understanding of infectious disease and help the world build smarter, healthier cities. The project is scheduled to last five years, so don’t expect to see results any time soon. But you can keep track of MetaSub’s progress: this map tracks the number of samples collected in each of the 54 participating cities.\nHow Germany commutes\nSleep until 7am, calmly eat some Frühstück, walk to the office. For many Germans, this is but a dream – or so says Zeit Online in its recent analysis of how Germany commutes to work.\nAs is the case in many countries, an increasingly specialised labour market along with a rising cost of living in city centres has caused many Germans to live far from their places of work. As a result, 27% of German workers now commute for 30 minutes or more each way.\nVideo: how Germany commutes. Source: Zeit Online\nZeit analyses the commuting patterns in each of Germany’s 402 districts. And with a series of beautifully designed animated maps, it shows what these characteristic “ant trails” reveal about each region’s social structure.\nIn the Rhein-Main district, Frankfurt is clearly the dominant destination. But cities such as Mainz, Darmstadt and Aschaffenburg also attract many workers, keeping the commuters reasonably spread out. In direct contrast to Rhein-Main is the Berlin district, where all roads lead to one location: Berlin.\nMunich boasts the largest number of inbound commuters of any German district.

Many are opting to study for a masters degree or postgraduate qualification online, enabling them to combine study with a full-time career.\nEducationGuardian.co.uk\/courses reveals a number of universities offering online postgraduate courses in business, electronic commerce, internet systems development, online education and even sociology - areas that make heavy use of internet technology. Most are at masters or diploma level.\nThe biggest online provider is the Open University, which has 22,000 postgraduates worldwide and offers more than 25 degrees wholly online as well as many others with online content. OU pro-vice-chancellor, Professor Linda Jones, says: \"Online links generally with the advantages of Open University study. Students can be very flexible and fit study around personal circumstances. Over 70% of our students work full-time and many are sponsored by their employers, who enjoy the benefits of developing the skills of their workforce.\"\nThe OU has discovered that take-up of online postgraduate degrees is enhanced by technical support such as online conferencing and student discussion groups, as well as an efficient online registration and tracking system. All online students are offered personal tutorials.\nOnline and distance learning provider Pearson Education runs the highly successful Herriot-Watt business school MBA, and has teamed up with Portsmouth University to offer an online MSc in electronic commerce and marketing and internet systems development. Now entering their second year, the Portsmouth online postgrad courses have attracted mainly UK students, but with growing numbers from Africa and Asia.\nA spokesperson for Pearson's distributed learning division says: \"We have identified e-courses as a growth area and the degrees we have developed with Portsmouth appeal mainly to people who are working. Most are on a career path and have been out of full-time education for several years.\"\nWith the university taking care of course content and the accreditation, and Pearson adding marketing expertise, an internet platform and technical support, Portsmouth's online students benefit from tried and tested distance learning techniques. Online also has the added advantage of enabling academics to update course material. A spokesperson says: \"Being online allows us to update once or twice a term.\"\nAdvantages vary, but a major attraction is flexibility. Students can complete an online degree over a longer timespan - possibly taking a mix and match of modules. Online is also suited to short but intensive certificate courses such as the certificate in online learning offered by London University's Institute of Education.\nIntended for busy academics wanting to bring themselves up to speed in online course delivery, the institute's course lasts 10 weeks, with an even shorter four-week version that incorporates five days of face-to-face teaching - in the terminology of online courses, a \"blended learning solution\".\nSenior lecturer Anita Pincas says: \"Online study makes it so much easier to deal with the huge numbers of students on today's campus. There's no way the teacher can see everyone. Plus it's very difficult for students to collaborate with each other if they are busy with lectures and seminars. Virtual meetings add to what students can do.\"\nSome online postgraduate courses offer students access to information that might prove difficult to research if all they had available was the university library. The University of Surrey management school's online MBA, now about to enter its third year, has links to the university's learning resources department, a full range of academic journals and even Reuters business information. Commercial director Chris Croker says: \"We give our students a laptop pre-loaded with all the multimedia course material, access to over 1,400 management journals and even access to our students' union. The only thing they can't do is buy a round of drinks!\"\nIt has to be said that the quality of online postgraduate degrees is far from uniform and a prospective student would have to tread carefully. John Beaumont, chief executive of the UK e-University, a government- and sector-funded body that helps universities to invest in and develop online degrees, is critical of some established courses and some past failures. \"E-learning has had a deservedly poor reputation. Three to four years ago, online courses tended to be underfunded, under-resourced and with insufficient technology.\"\nHowever, a booming world market in online distance learning has provided the investment needed to produce a quality product, and Beaumont stresses that the best online degrees are linked to accreditation by universities with world-class reputations. The UKeU has helped to launch several flagship online postgrad degrees, including an MSc in geographic information systems with Leeds and Southampton universities and a bio-infomatics masters offered by Leeds and Manchester.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Geographic Information System errors because it mentions the launch of an MSc in geographic information systems (GIS) in collaboration with Leeds and Southampton universities.

But in the 1990s, it took off, racing to ever higher latitudes and crossing the date line in late 2017. In the process, it came to within just a few hundred kilometres of the geographic pole.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nP.LIVERMORE\nImage caption,\nRegions of negative magnetic flux have been in a \"tug of war\"\nUsing data from satellites that have measured the evolving shape of Earth's magnetic field over the past 20 years, Dr Livermore and colleagues have attempted to model the North Magnetic Pole's wanderings.\nTwo years ago when they first presented their ideas at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Washington DC, they suggested there might be a connection with a westward-accelerating jet of molten material in the outer core.

{"num":80,"Time":"5 minute read\nUpdated 2:26 PM EDT, Thu June 17, 2021","Title":"Two obscure service providers briefly broke the internet. It could happen again","Content":"New York\nCNN Business\n — \nFor the second time in 10 days, a giant chunk of the internet briefly broke because of an outage at a company most people have probably never heard of.\nThe websites for Southwest Airlines (LUV), United Airlines (UAL), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBAUF), the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and others all went dark on Thursday after an issue at cloud service provider Akamai (AKAM) Technologies.\nThe situation was nearly identical to another recent outage caused by a similar company called Fastly, which took out major sites including Reddit, CNN, Amazon (AMZN) and a UK government website.\nAlthough the outages were both short-lived, they serve as jarring reminders of the internet’s fragility. And at a time when concerns are growing about cyber risks to critical physical US infrastructure, the outages may raise alarms about risks to our digital infrastructure, too.\nNearly all websites rely on a service provider like Fastly or Akamai — which run what’s called a “content delivery network” or CDN (we’ll get into what that means later on) — as a layer between internet users and the servers where their content is hosted. The problem: There are only a small handful of CDN operators. If one of them goes down — whether because of a benign software bug, as in Fastly and Akamai’s case, or a cyberattack — huge swaths of the internet could go with it.\n“Absolutely the biggest centralized point on the internet is these CDNs,” making them a potential target for cybercriminals or government actors, Nick Merrill, research fellow at UC Berkeley’s Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity, said following the Fastly outage.\nUtilities, social media platforms, news organizations, financial services, government agencies and more rely on CDNs to operate their websites. Although Fastly was able to restore its service quickly, one can imagine problematic future scenarios if the resolution is slower.\n“The problem with the internet is it’s always there until it isn’t,” former Microsoft Chief Technology Officer David Vaskevitch, who now runs photo storage service Mylio, told CNN Business earlier this month. “For a system with so many interconnected parts, it’s not always reliable. Any one fragile part can bring it down.”\nEven before the recent outages, internet infrastructure experts have been ringing the alarm about concentration in the CDN space, where the small number of major providers could make for big targets for an attack.\nWhat is a CDN?\nFor websites to load and run as quickly as we expect them to, they need to have computing power located physically close — at least relatively — to the people wanting to access them.\nThat’s why companies like Fastly and Akamai exist. Their “content delivery networks” are essentially a collection of “cloud” servers distributed across various geographic locations where websites can store content in close proximity to their users. This makes it possible for apps and websites to load within seconds and enables high quality streaming. It also saves huge amounts of energy.\nHow a massive part of the internet went down for an hour\nCDNs play a crucial security role by preventing so-called “distributed denial-of-service” attacks, where bad actors send tons of requests to access a website in an effort to overwhelm its systems and shut it down.\n“They’re indispensable infrastructure,” Merrill said.\nThe catch is that so many websites — big and small — use CDNs as a layer between users and the servers where their content lives that when a CDN goes down, much of the internet can go with it.\nIn Fastly’s case, a software bug that appeared as part of a normal update briefly took out around 85% of the company’s network, the company said. Akamai said that around 500 of its customers were affected by an issue with its DDOS mitigation software that caused its outage.\nAnd it’s not just CDNs. Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing service that supports numerous popular websites, has also experienced outages that end up taking down large chunks of the internet.\nThe risk\nWith any technology, occasional failures and outages are inevitable.\n“There is no error-free internet, so the measure of success is how quickly a major internet firm like Fastly can recover from a rare outage like this,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at network analytics firm Kentik.\nFastly detected its issue “within one minute,” and within less than an hour, 95% of its network was operating normally, senior vice president of engineering and infrastructure Nick Rockwell said in a blog post. Akamai, likewise, said it notified customers of the issue within seconds and the issue was resolved within four hours, though it took steps to ensure that most affected customers were only offline for a few minutes.\nThe bigger problem with the internet’s huge reliance on just a few CDN’s is the possibility that they become the target of an attack, Merrill said. He also worries about a potential government order dictating what such companies can and can’t provide support for, which could amount to government censorship of the internet.\nFastly is actually one of the smaller players in the CDN market. The largest is Cloudflare, which supports around 25 million internet properties including county websites, national ministries of health and corporate giants like IBM and Shopify. In 2019, Cloudflare was briefly in the spotlight after blocking support for 8Chan, making it difficult for the controversial online message board site to stay online.\nAkamai is also among the larger CDN providers.\nTo be sure, CDNs have backup protections in place and websites can contract with more than one CDN operator in case of failures. Most of the time, an outage will be like Fastly’s — a temporary inconvenience. And websites could still appear online without a CDN, they’d just load slowly and be more at risk of cyberattacks.\nBut experts say there is still a risk that a bigger player like Cloudflare is targeted, or that multiple CDNs are hit at once.\n“Worst case, it’s going to be an attack on Cloudflare,” Merrill said. “The Russian government or the Chinese government is going to take down Cloudflare and it’s going to break the internet.”\nThe solution, he said, could be antitrust regulation of the industry — similar to the regulatory pressure facing more consumer-facing tech companies — or promoting the growth of more CDN alternatives.\n“People are really concerned rightly about antitrust issues in the tech space” Merrill said. “I don’t think that CDNs are as visible to people, but they’re probably the most important part of the core internet infrastructure that’s been privatized and centralized.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Geographic Information System (GIS) errors because it discusses how internet outages occurred due to issues with cloud service providers like Akamai Technologies and Fastly.

It says more than 3,000 people died in 2012.\n'Compromised' infrastructure\nThe study - by researchers from the University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, Simon Fraser University and Mustansiriya University - covers March 2003 until June 2011, six months before the US withdrawal.\nFor it, interviewers surveyed 2,000 randomly selected households in 100 geographical clusters across Iraq's 18 provinces between May 2011 and July 2011. Each was asked about deaths among household members and siblings from 2001, when Iraq's infrastructure was already degrading because of international sanctions, to the time of the interview.\nFrom that, the researchers found the \"wartime crude death rate\" was 4.55 per 1,000 people, more than 50% higher than before the invasion.\nBy multiplying those rates by the annual Iraq population, the researchers estimated that the \"total excess deaths attributable to the war\" up until mid-2011 to be about 405,000.\nThey also estimated that an additional 56,000 deaths were not counted because of the emigration of households from Iraq.\nThe study concludes that more than 60% of the estimated 461,000 excess deaths were directly attributable to violence, with the rest associated with the collapse of infrastructure and other indirect causes. These include the failures of health, sanitation, transportation, communication and other systems.\nThe most common causes of non-violent deaths linked to the war were heart attacks or cardiovascular conditions, followed by infant or childhood deaths other than injuries, chronic illnesses and cancer.\nMedia caption,\n5 live's Shelagh Fogarty speaks with Nickolay Mladenov and Dr Mowaffak Al Rubaie\n\"In a war situation, people can't leave their homes to get medical care.

{"num":95,"Time":"7 minute read\nUpdated 6:59 AM EDT, Sat July 31, 2021","Title":"The official hurricane forecast track could be confusing the public","Content":"CNN\n — \nThe most used and looked at graphic when a hurricane is forecast could be unintentionally misleading the public into perceiving that they could be safe from a hurricane’s track and impacts.\nThe graphic in question is the track of the hurricane issued by the National Hurricane Center, but even more specifically the track forecast cone – colloquially known as the “cone of uncertainty.”\nThe cone represents the probable track of the center of a tropical system and extends up to five days in 12-hour increments, according to the hurricane center.\nEven though the center of a storm remains within the cone 60 to 70% of the time, according to data from the hurricane center over the last five years, the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes often extend much farther than this defined boundary.\nNow, researchers at Colorado State University (CSU) may have come up with a better way to inform the public about hurricanes to help keep them safe.\nIt is all about perspective\nThe problem stems from how people perceive the boundaries of the track forecast cone.\nIn general, people perceive areas that are highlighted within the cone as “at risk” and areas that are outside of the cone as being “safe.” Researchers refer to this perceived notion as the “containment effect.”\n“The most common misunderstanding about the cone of uncertainty is the border of it,” said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. “People see it and think that being inside the cone is bad, and outside the cone is fine. That is most definitely not the intended message.”\nThe intended message of the track forecast cone is to show where the center of the storm could be over the next five days. Statistically speaking, the longer the forecast period, the more room for error exist. The cone is much wider five days out than just 24 hours out to account for this error.\nIf the cone does not change significantly, then the containment effect does not play as much of a role.\nA good example is Hurricane Elsa from earlier this year. The forecast track for that storm five days out was almost an exact match of where the storm actually ended up. This made is very easy for people to figure out evacuation protocols.\nFive-day forecast cone of Hurricane Elsa overlaid with the actual storm track\nBut weather forecasting is not a perfect science.\n“The cone is just a shape defined by track forecast errors over the previous five years, such that there’s historically a two-thirds chance the track of the center of the storm will remain inside the cone, and a one-third chance it will be outside the cone,” McNoldy said. “The same cone is used all year long, for every forecast of every storm … they’re identical.”\nHowever, tropical storms and hurricanes are not all identical, so this thought process could pose a problem when it comes time for hurricane preparations and evacuations.\nIn the case of Hurricane Marco in 2020, the center of the storm tracked outside of the cone originally issued five days before its approach to the Gulf Coast.\nThat means if you based your hurricane preparedness plans solely off the assumption that only people inside the cone need to worry, you may not have been ready for this particular storm.\nFive-day forecast cone of Hurricane Marco overlaid with the actual storm track\nSo how can this be fixed?\nEnter the new tool designed by researchers at CSU. It is a series of moving dots, called “zoomies,” rather than a static image of a cone, and it seems to be more effective.\nThe premise of this new tool is based on the concept called ensemble perception, which is your visual system’s ability to look at a group of objects and extract a lot of information about the group.\nFor example, Jessica Witt, one of the lead researchers on the CSU project, says “if you watch a herd of animals running or a school of fish you can tell not just what direction the group is heading, but also have a sense of whether they are getting closer together or spreading apart.”\n“We wanted to create a tool that might enable ordinary people to better grasp what might unfold,” Witt said. “To do that we are creating a way to tap into an aspect of the visual system. Our visual world requires us to perceive and use uncertainty, and so the visual system is inherently equipped to interpret those types of information. Leveraging these capabilities with the right visualization might help people understand the forecast and make better decisions.”\nThe study participants were from the University of West Florida (where hurricanes are common), as well as Colorado State University (where hurricanes are not common). For the students from CSU it also means they are largely free of biases that might arise from previous personal experiences with hurricanes.\nThe responses were nearly identical from both universities, suggesting that even people with personal experience of hurricanes extract the same types of information from these ensembles.\n“Participants in our study see a series of hurricane forecasts, and for each forecast they are shown the position of a town in different places relative to the path of the storm,” Witt said. “The town might be located directly in the central (most likely) path of the storm or off to the side.”\n2021 Atlantic Hurricane Season Fast Facts\nThe study found that participants chose to evacuate the towns located within the cone at high rates, and the towns outside the cone at low rates. The difference between the two was very steep and happened over a very short geographical distance, basically defined by the boundary of the forecast cone itself.\nBut when the zoomies were added, evacuation rates focused more on the town’s location near the center of the storm’s projected path rather than simply whether the town was inside the forecast cone.\nAnother inherent problem with the traditional cone is that it doesn’t give you any indication of which location will have the highest rainfall, the biggest storm surge, or the best chance for tornadoes. For those you need additional information found on other forecast graphics.\nBut Witt and her research colleague, psychology professor Dr. Benjamin Clegg, think their zoomies map can help with that too.\n“The zoomies offer substantial flexibility with respect to their design,” Witt says. “For example, we can use color, size, and flickering to indicate various risks such as extreme wind speeds, rainfall, or storm surge, and those can be perceived within the ensemble.”\nHurricane Statistics Fast Facts\n“The cone graphics try to be everything to everyone, and the end result is a complicated graphic that might not necessarily meet its goals,” McNoldy says. “Although all of its components are described on the graphic itself, people don’t always read legends or descriptive text.”\nThe Hurakan Project, developed by the University of Miami, has an interdisciplinary team looking at a wide variety of concerns with the cone and innovative ways to make it better.\n“Importantly, impacts from hurricanes extend for hundreds of miles away from the center, so destructive impacts will not be limited to the cone even for a perfect down-the-middle forecast,” McNoldy said.\nThis is important because while mortality rates from hurricanes have declined in the US, the economic cost has been increasing, according to the Hurakan Project. On top of that, the preparation, evacuation, response, and recovery during these events is often experienced disproportionately by vulnerable populations.\nIn other words, people do not want to waste valuable time and money preparing for a storm that they do not need to because they may need that money and time later in the season when another storm arrives. For many families, the luxury of infinite financial means to prepare and evacuate is just not a reality.\nIn the experimental \"zoomies,\" the black dots represent potential storm paths and move toward different locations. The cone represents the traditional NHC track forecast cone.\nHowever, CSU is not looking to get rid of the official forecast cone entirely.\n“We also found that you can overlay the zoomies on top of the cone, and people understand the forecast better,” Witt says. “In fact, if they have practice with this, they do a better job of interpreting the NHC cone after this experience than if they did not see the zoomies paired with the cone. So a simple switch for meteorologists might be to show zoomies with the cone.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news discusses concerns related to the official hurricane forecast track, specifically focusing on the track forecast cone issued by the National Hurricane Center.

Schools that contacted the Guardian said they were forced to give up and use printed test papers instead.\nOne parent said: “The exam officer at my daughter’s school was in disbelief yesterday at how bad it was. He said he had never seen anything like it.”\nAfter the scale of the problems became clear, Oxford said: “This year, Elat scores will not be used in any formal shortlisting calculation. No candidate will be deselected [that is, not shortlisted] on the basis of their Elat score.”\nBill Watkin, the chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges’ Association, said: “The Oxford University admissions tests were beset by technical problems, largely a malfunctioning platform and inadequate support communications, and too many students were unable to take the test in a calm, orderly environment.\n“The big concern is that the technology meltdown will have affected the performance of some candidates and not others, and that the unlucky ones will miss out on their university dream.”\nA spokesperson for Oxford said: “We understand the difficulty and disappointment some UK students have experienced because of technical problems with online admissions tests run by a new provider, and we are very grateful to the students and their teachers for their patience and feedback.\n“Tests are only one part of the admissions process and we will use a range of information, including candidates’ individual circumstances, to help us assess their potential and ensure no one is disadvantaged by these events.\n“We will be having further talks with the provider to understand better why these problems occurred with their systems and obtain assurances that there will be no repeat.”\nOne school in the south of England, which did not want to be identified, said the problems affected its students taking English, maths and geography admissions tests.\n“The difficulties that students faced included problems with the initial logon, being locked out midway through, errors in questions and extra time not being correctly added,” the school told parents, adding that “the difficulties are entirely the fault and responsibility of Oxford”.\nThis year Oxford opted to use an online platform for most of its admissions tests for propective undergraduates, developed by Tata Consulting Services (TCS). TCS has been contacted for a response.\nThe examination officer for one school said: “From the outset, the entire organisation of the Oxford online admissions tests was a disaster. Communication was poor, with email the only form of contact and taking over a week, as standard, to receive a reply. There was no test system put in place for a trial run.”\nSevere problems were also reported with the mathematical admissions test, which was supposed to be a hybrid of online and written answers.\n“My son took the test today and he said the online system crashed about 10 times. As a result some students completed the test on paper. It sounded like a complete mess,” said one parent. “My worry is that some schools may have been badly affected, while others might have avoided the problems. But Oxford will treat all the tests the same.”\nOxford’s mathematics department said it was “disappointed” to hear of the disruption, and that it “does not want candidates’ applications to be disadvantaged by adverse circumstances during the test.”\nThis week the AQA exam board announced that it planned to use online assessments for a number of GCSE subjects from 2026 onwards.\nWatkin said: “At a time when the possibility of increasing the use of online testing is being explored and promoted, this week’s experience has been a salutary reminder that we are not nearly there yet.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Geographic Information System (GIS) errors because it discusses technical problems with online admissions tests used by Oxford University.

{"num":3,"Time":"Thu 23 Mar 2006 19.42 CET","Title":"Ordnance Survey challenged to open up","Content":"The inventor of the world wide web has called for more open access to Ordnance Survey (OS) mapping data - and may get his wish later this year. Sir Tim Berners-Lee told an Oxford University audience last week getting \"basic, raw data from Ordnance Survey\" online would help build the \"semantic web\", which he defines as a web of data using standard formats so that relevant data can be found and processed by computers.\n\"There's a moral argument that says, for a well-run country, we should know where we are, where things are, and that data should be available,\" he said.\nBerners-Lee said it may be reasonable for OS, the premier state-owned supplier of public sector information, to continue to charge for its high-resolution mapping. But even if licences were required, he added, OS should make its data open to manipulation. \"I want to do something with the data, I want to be able to join it with all my other data,\" he said. \"I want to be able to do Google Maps things to a ridiculous extent, and not limited in the way that Google Maps is.\"\nThe guest lecturer said he had discussed this with OS. \"They are certainly thinking about this and studying what they can do. OS is in favour of doing the right thing for the country, as well as maintaining its existence, so I think there's a fair chance we'll find mutual agreement.\"\nOS said it was considering opening access to data, through applications programming interfaces (APIs) for example, but only for non-commercial use. \"If it happens, it will be in the next six months or so,\" said Ed Parsons, chief technology officer. Parsons said OS provides universities with access to its data. \"It's about expanding this to non-academic research,\" he said. However, those using APIs would be barred from competing with OS's paying customers, even on a non-commercial basis. \"We're constrained by competition law,\" said Parsons. The BBC's Backstage project, which allows non-commercial re-use of BBC material, is a possible model.\nBerners-Lee said this debate was the first of many. \"What happens with OS is going to be replayed with anonymised medical data, with data about all kinds of public things.\" Others, he warned, already provide more open access to geospatial data, including Google Maps - which uses OS data - but also those gathering and releasing information for free. \"If you don't make [lower-resolution mapping data] publicly available, there will be people with their cars and GPS devices, driving around with their laptops,\" he said. \"They will be cataloguing every lane, and enjoying it, driving 4x4s behind your farm at the dead of night. There will, if necessary, be a grass-roots remapping.\"\nMeanwhile, according to documents published last week, OS faces losing its official status as a fair trader unless it changes the way it licenses its geographical data. The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI), a unit of the cabinet office charged with promoting fair access to crown copyright data, says there is substance to complaints from commercial mapping firms that OS has been \"obstructive and slow\" in licensing its data. The inspection renews OS's accreditation under the government's fair trading scheme, so long as the agency acts on recommendations over the next year. OS promised to do so but accused the inspectors of failing to take into account the market in which it works.\nThe report is the second verification of OS's commitment to a level-playing field in the public sector information market. It said while the agency is \"committed to the principles\" of fair trading, the practice is sometimes different. It highlights the policy of licensing data for specific uses only, which \"appears to many potential and actual users as rigid and unreasonable and does not encourage re-use\".\nAnother problem is \"sub-licensing\", in which OS tries to protect its intellectual property throughout a chain of products using data derived from its work. Royalties can become payable even when OS data has become a small component of the end product. The length of time taken to negotiate licences also comes under fire. In one case, the protracted process led to the abandonment of a project for the re-use of data, the report says. It calls on OS to set demanding targets for cutting the time to negotiate contracts.\nThe inspection also recommends OS review its terms and conditions to ensure obligations are not onerous and there is a balance between the agency and its licensees. OS questions this, saying: \"The relationship between any licensor and a licensee is inherently imbalanced.\" It suggests that, under OPSI's proposals, firms licensing its data would have the right to decide unilaterally to pay less for it. \"We do not accept the conclusion that we impose onerous terms on licensees.\"\nThe biggest potential fall-out between trading fund and regulator may be over the recommendation OS involve the OPSI in the discussion of \"issues relevant\" to the fair trading scheme. OS said it would consult OPSI as part of a wider process but it does not accept OPSI as being directly involved in developing OS policies.\nThe response also implies the office does not fully understand OS's duties as a trading fund. \"OPSI needs to understand the business environment and Trading Fund framework in which OS is tasked with delivering its objectives.\"\nThe OPSI report acknowledges OS's position as the most visible trading fund \"naturally increases its exposure to criticism\". It could have added OS will also be seen as the test case of whether the government's policy to create a fair trade while encouraging data owners to behave as commercial entities is workable.\nThere is a dedicated website and blog for the Free Our Data campaign at (www.freeourdata.org.uk).\n· If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Geospatial data manipulation issues because it discusses the need for open access to Ordnance Survey (OS) mapping data and the potential for manipulation of geospatial data.

Environment Program (UNEP).\n“It’s basically a time slide... you can go back in time, and what is does is show you where water has disappeared,” said Elisabeth Mullin Bernhardt, a program manager at UNEP, on Monday.\n“It can show you where water never was and now is there. It can show you where water is seasonal.”\nFor Africa’s Lake Chad, for example, access to comprehensive data and images showing surrounding land and rivers could help explain why the lake, on which so many depend, is drying up so quickly, said Kenya-based Bernhardt.\nGiven that most countries share water sources, the information could also be used to encourage neighboring nations to work together on strategies to manage rivers or lakes, she said.\nGoogle is using artificial intelligence and cloud computing to process a massive amount of satellite imagery and data, stretching back over three decades, before it can be analyzed, said Rebecca Moore, director of Google Earth and Earth Engine.\n“Much of the world does not have access to good data about the state of their forests, their rivers and lakes and coastal eco-systems and how they’ve been changing over time,” Moore told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.\n“It’s a critically important time because there are dramatic changes going on, due to climate change and urbanization and a number of factors that are in some cases significantly depleting fresh water supply.”\nImproved information could lead to better investment in environmental services as countries try to meet their Sustainable Development Goals, said UNEP.\nAgreed at the U.N. in 2015, the 17 global goals include targets to end poverty and hunger, combat climate change, and provide universal access to water and sanitation by 2030.\nGovernments are currently reviewing progress on the goals at U.N. headquarters in New York, where UNEP and Google announced the satellite initiative.\nWhile researchers will focus on water ecosystems, the platform could be expanded to include issues such as desertification or plastics in the world’s oceans, said Bernhardt.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Geospatial data manipulation issues because Google, in partnership with the United Nations, is using vast quantities of raw satellite imagery and data to create geospatial maps and data for an online platform.

Technology is moving in that direction,” NGA Director Letitia Long told an annual space conference hosted by the Space Foundation.\nLong told reporters after her speech that NGA and other intelligence agencies backed the effort, but the White House was still coordinating the positions of the Pentagon, Commerce Department, State Department and other agencies. She said she did not know when a decision would be announced.\n“It’s not a question of yes or no. It’s a question of when and how,” said a second senior U.S. official involved in the coordination process. Approving sales of sharper imagery involed myriad nuanced and complex issues, said the official.\nDigitalGlobe has pressed the U.S. government for years to allow it to sell higher resolution imagery but officials have worried about undermining the intelligence advantage the government has from even higher resolution satellite images.\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper last month said that U.S. intelligence agencies had agreed to allow commercial providers to sell higher resolution imagery. Sources familiar with the process said they expected the government to approve a phased implementation over the course of this year.\nLong said other countries were rapidly developing their own advanced imagery capabilities and she worried that U.S. industry could lose its competitive edge.\nColorado-based DigitalGlobe applied nearly one year ago for a license to increase the resolution of its imagery from 50 cm to 25 cm. The company has said it hopes the U.S. government will act quickly to finalize the decision. It is preparing to launch its new WorldView 3 satellite in August, which would allow the company to sell imagery accurate to 31 cm.\nLong said allowing the company to sell higher resolution imagery could allow adversaries to track U.S. troop movements, but the license could be structured to more tightly control imagery in the event of a military conflict.\nThat, however, could pose problems for the company’s ability to market its product overseas, she said.\n“It’s taking us a while because it’s a complex issue,” Long said. “We want to do the best thing for the U.S. commercially, as well as our nation’s security.”\nLong also underscored the importance of the tools and processes used to analyze imagery, noting that simply having access to better resolution images would not necessarily give potential adversaries an advantage.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also met Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar.\n\"Over [the] last two decades, our bilateral relationship has grown steadily in its substance, facets and significance,\" Mr Jaishankar said on Tuesday. He added that the talks would enable the two countries to \"engage much more intensively on matters of national security\".\nThe Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation, or BECA, is among the few deals that the US signs with close partners. It allows India access to a range of sensitive geospatial and aeronautical data that is crucial for military action.\nThe two sides also signed a clutch of other deals in the fields of nuclear energy, earth sciences and alternative medicine. But BECA is the most significant deal among them.\nIt will allow the US to \"provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on US-supplied aircraft to India\", an Indian defence source told Reuters news agency - that also means the US can fit high-end navigational equipment in the aircraft it supplies to India.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nIndia has been sending reinforcements to the border with China\nIts signing comes at a time when India is locked in one of its most hostile standoffs with China along their disputed border in the Himalayan region.\nTwenty Indian soldiers died in a clash that erupted between troops on both sides in June, sparking months-long rounds of diplomatic talks to ease tensions. But that has not helped to de-escalate hostilities so far.\nRelations between the US and China have also soured in recent months with President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of Beijing's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The US has also rebuked China for imposing a new security law in Hong Kong, following large-scale protests.\nThe deal is another step forward in deepening India-US military ties.

Echoes of such plans can be heard in the statements of both countries' leaders.\nThis visit will reinforce US and India's \"commitment to deepening military-to-military co-operation,\" an official statement said after Mr Esper met Mr Singh on Monday.\n\"Our talks today were fruitful, aimed at further deepening defence co-operation in a wide range of areas,\" Mr Singh later tweeted.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nINDIAN MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS\/HANDOUT\nImage caption,\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and his wife, Susan, landed in Delhi on Monday\nThis is the third round of the \"two-plus-two\" annual dialogue between India and the US.\nThe first one was held in Delhi in 2018.

Analysts say that the timing is significant and highlights India as a priority for the US.\nA tight diplomatic rope\nVikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi\nThe deal is key, given the current geopolitical scenario. The US seems to have sensed an opportunity in the India-China border standoff and wants to further raise its profile in the region.\nIt's being seen as a signal to China that Washington considers Delhi a close military ally. And this is likely to bolster the Trump administration's anti-China rhetoric.\nBut Indian officials will have to walk a tight diplomatic rope.\nDelhi continues to hold military-level talks with Beijing to de-escalate the situation at the border and a peaceful resolution is in its best interest. It will not want a conflict, even a limited one, at a time when it's fighting a long-haul battle against the pandemic.\nThis was evident from the statements made by the leaders of the two countries at a joint press conference on Tuesday.\nWhile Mr Singh and Mr Jaishankar did not directly mention China in their statements, both Mr Esper and Mr Pompeo took swipes at China.\nIndia will also be mindful of its relations with Russia.

He said market giants were more open to commercial practices, cutting costs, speeding up programs and testing new technologies.\nFor instance, he said the Air Force cut the cost of a new ground-based radar for tracking space objects by two thirds by mandating prototypes and manufacturing demonstrations. A contract award to Lockheed or Raytheon Co is expected soon.\nLockheed, Boeing and others are embracing new production processes such as 3D printing, and hunting down commercial orders to offset an expected slowdown in U.S. government buying.\nLoverro said the Pentagon was still expected to spend about $300 billion on military space programs over the next 15 years, but buying practices will change to make satellites more “resilient.”\n“Do we continue to buy what we’ve been used to buying, or do we move in a different direction?” he said. He cited widespread agreement that the Air Force should stop buying Boeing-built Wideband Global System satellites since commercial satellites now carry more bandwidth.\nThe Air Force is studying ways to use commercial bandwidth, beyond leasing services as it does during military operations.\nThat could create opportunities for satellite operators like Iridium Communications, which plans to launch 66 new satellites starting in 2017 that will host payloads for the government or other customers.\nJames Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, said 90 percent of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s underlying intelligence now comes from companies like DigitalGlobe Inc. But he said companies should not rely on the government to underwrite new satellite programs.\nU.S. officials said they welcome competition in the rocket launch market. But new players such as Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, have complained that change is slow in coming and say the United States risks being overtaken by other countries.

{"num":32,"Time":"Updated 8:53 PM EST, Tue February 13, 2018","Title":"US intel chiefs unanimous that Russia is targeting 2018 elections","Content":"CNN\n — \nDirector of National Intelligence Dan Coats said Tuesday “there should be no doubt” that Russia sees the 2018 US elections as a target.\nCoats and the other top national security officials told the Senate Intelligence Committee that they still view Moscow as a threat to the 2018 elections, a stance that appears at odds with President Donald Trump’s repeated dismissals of Russian election meddling.\n“We expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokesmen and other means to influence, to try to build on its wide range of operations and exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States,” Coats said at a hearing on worldwide threats. “There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 US midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations.”\nTuesday’s hearing touched on a wide array of threats, from North Korea to China to weapons of mass destruction. But Russia’s interference into US and other elections loomed large amid the committee’s investigation into Russian election meddling and the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russian officials.\nUS intel chief says risk of global conflict highest since Cold War\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, the committee’s top Democrat, warned that the US was not prepared to handle the Russian threat to US elections heading into the midterms.\n“We’ve had more than a year to get our act together and address the threat posed by Russia and implement a strategy to deter future attacks. But we still do not have a plan,” Warner said.\nWarner questioned Coats and the other officials testifying — CIA Director Mike Pompeo, FBI Director Chris Wray, NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley and National Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Robert Cardillo — about how the government was addressing the threat to both the US election systems and through social media. He asked all six of the US officials testifying to reaffirm the intelligence community’s findings last year that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and that the Kremlin will continue to intervene in future elections. All said yes.\nDemocrats pointed to that unanimous assessment to criticize Trump for maintaining a contrasting view to his own intelligence community.\nSen. Angus King, I-Maine, urged the intelligence chiefs to persuade the President to accept their findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n“My problem is, I talk to people in Maine who say the whole thing is a witch hunt and a hoax ‘because the President told me,’” King said. “There’s no doubt, as you all have testified today, we cannot confront this threat, which is a serious one, with a whole of government response when the leader of the government continues to that deny it exists.”\nSen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, asked whether the efforts to counter Russia’s election activities in 2018 had been directed by Trump.\n“Not as specifically directed by the President,” Wray responded.\nPompeo told the committee that the CIA had already “seen Russian activity and intentions to have an impact on the next election cycle here.”\nHe also raised the prospect that the US could respond to election meddling with offensive cybercapabilities. “We do have some capability offensively to raise the cost for those who would dare challenge the United States’ elections,” Pompeo said.\nPakistan still not cracking down on militants, US intel chief says\nWarner also questioned the government’s response to the Russian social media influence efforts. Warner has been critical of the response of companies like Facebook and Twitter to the Russian activity on their social networks.\nCoats responded that multiple government agencies are working on the social media effort, and they are trying to work with companies to help them address the threat. “We cannot as a government direct them what to do, but we are certainly spending every effort we can to work with them to provide some answers to this question,” Coats said.\nSen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, however, took issue with Warner’s assertion that the US was not prepared for Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2018 elections on social media.\nRisch said that the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the intelligence community were not surprised at Russia’s efforts in 2016. And he argued that the public has become more educated too.\n“With all due respect to my friend from Virginia, I think the American people are ready for this,” Risch said. “The American people are smart people, they realize there are people attempting to manipulate them, both domestically and foreign. And I agree with everyone on the panel this is going to go on. This is the way the Russians have done business, this is no surprise to us.”\nAnother issue related to Russia’s election interference is the US voting systems themselves. The Department of Homeland Security has said there were Russian efforts to try to hack into the voting systems in 21 states, and several lawmakers have raised concerns states and localities are unprepared for the 2018 election cycle.\n“Voting begins in March, that’s next month,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican. “If we’re going to have any impact on securing that voting system itself, it would seem to me, we need to be acting quickly.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Geospatial data manipulation issues because it discusses threats to the 2018 US elections, including potential interference by Russia.

{"num":25,"Time":"Fri 26 Jun 2020 17.23 CEST","Title":"Florida governor under fire over claims state is 'cooking the books' on Covid-19","Content":"Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis’s faltering response to soaring new coronavirus numbers in his state is descending into acrimony, after an accusation his administration is “cooking the books” in an effort to hide the true impact of the devastating pandemic.\nMore than 20m Americans could have contracted Covid-19, experts say\nRead more\nThe claim from the state’s former leading Covid-19 data scientist comes as Florida smashed its own one-day record for new cases of the disease on Friday with 8,942, after two successive days above 5,000 – by far the highest figures since the pandemic began.\nThe situation in Florida is part of a widespread surge of infections across broad swathes of the US, especially in states – often run by Republicans – which have rushed to reopen their economies.\nSo far this month, Florida has seen confirmed cases more than double from 56,000 to above 114,000, and set daily records on seven of the last 13 days. Meanwhile, the number of deaths among Florida residents has climbed to almost 3,400.\nRebekah Jones, who says she was fired from her job in charge of the state’s official Covid-19 database in May for refusing to manipulate its figures, claimed on social media to have evidence that employees at Florida’s department of health “have been instructed this week to change the numbers and begin slowly deleting deaths and cases so it looks like Florida is improving next week in the lead-up to July 4, like they’ve ‘made it over the hump’.”\n“They’re only reporting all these cases now so they can restrict reporting next week to make everyone think it’s over,” she said.\nDeSantis, a Donald Trump loyalist who has refused to slow Florida’s reopening or implement a statewide mask mandate, angrily dismissed the claim, calling a reporter from the Miami Herald who asked him about it “embarrassing”.\n“You guys have been on the conspiracy bandwagon for months,” he snapped at a press conference on Thursday, without addressing the specifics of Jones’s assertion. “You need to move on.”\nBy any standards, it has been a rough week for DeSantis, who is standing firm against mounting pressure from public health officials and even some political allies for tighter measures to counter the virus’s steep resurgence in his state, with its large population of vulnerable elderly retirees.\nA month after berating reporters whom he said “waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York,” that scenario has been realized, with New York joining New Jersey and Connecticut this week in ordering visitors from Florida – among other badly affected states – to quarantine.\nBeachgoers enjoy the warm weather in Florida on Wednesday. Photograph: Cristóbal Herrera\/EPA\nHospital systems around Florida are reporting steep drops in the availability in intensive care and other beds, even as the department of health changes how it records such figures.\nPerhaps more wounding is veiled criticism from fellow elected Republicans.\nWhile DeSantis resists calls for a statewide mandate on masks, municipalities including Miami have enacted the requirement; Miami’s mayor Francis Suarez is proposing $250 fines for those who refuse.\nSuarez has also debunked DeSantis’s often-repeated claim that increased testing accounts for Florida’s coronavirus surge. “It has really nothing to do with an increased amount of testing. It has to do with more people that are getting tested coming out positive,” he said.\nIn Miami-Dade county this week, the rate of positivity of those tested reached 27%, almost three times greater than the county’s average 14-day target of 10%.\nThe masks issue has become a political battle in Florida, with Palm Beach county passing a mandate in the face of furious resistance from some residents, one of whom declared at an extraordinary commission meeting this week that the move would “throw God’s wonderful breathing system out the door”.\nEven Marco Rubio, Florida’s senior Republican US senator, weighed in. “Everyone should just wear a damn mask,” he said.\nBut DeSantis, like the president, has refused to advocate for the wearing of masks, despite incontrovertible scientific evidence they help curtail the spread of the disease.\n“Ron DeSantis has followed Donald Trump’s erratic leadership for three and a half months, and it clearly has not worked out for Floridians,” said Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic party. “Their eagerness to declare victory before the job was done has led us to this moment.”\n00:05:28\nFrom miracle cures to slowing testing: how Trump has defied science on coronavirus – video explainer\nData scientist Jones, meanwhile, continues to be one of the biggest thorns in the governor’s side. After her dismissal, for “insubordination” according to DeSantis’s staff, the geospatial science graduate created her own privately-funded rival Covid-19 database for Florida.\nBased on official state figures, Jones’s platform expands them in several key areas, notably increased numbers of cases and deaths. Those figures are higher, she says, because Florida reports only statistics for residents, and does not include out-of-state visitors.\nAdditionally, the Jones database features statistics that the state site does not, including the number of ICU beds available across Florida, and whether any of its 67 counties meets current state criteria for reopening. As of Thursday, only three did.\nAntibody test accuracy lower during first 14 days of Covid-19 symptoms\nRead more\nThe Florida department of health did not respond to a request from the Guardian for comment about Jones’s allegations of data deletion, or the discrepancies between her database and the state figures.\nPublic health experts say that accurate data is essential for responding to the pandemic.\n“That data is clearly indicating we have a problem. Testing data, symptom data, hospitalisation data, it’s all been clearly going up,” said Dr Mary Jo Trepka, professor and chair of the department of epidemiology at Florida International University’s Robert Stempel College of public health.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Geospatial data manipulation issues because it involves allegations of data manipulation related to COVID-19 statistics in Florida.

{"num":7,"Time":"Wed 31 Jul 2013 14.56 CEST","Title":"XKeyscore: NSA tool collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet'","Content":"A top secret National Security Agency program allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing emails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals, according to documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nThe NSA boasts in training materials that the program, called XKeyscore, is its \"widest-reaching\" system for developing intelligence from the internet.\nThe latest revelations will add to the intense public and congressional debate around the extent of NSA surveillance programs. They come as senior intelligence officials testify to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, releasing classified documents in response to the Guardian's earlier stories on bulk collection of phone records and Fisa surveillance court oversight.\nThe files shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by the Guardian on June 10.\n\"I, sitting at my desk,\" said Snowden, could \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email\".\nUS officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of Snowden's assertion: \"He's lying. It's impossible for him to do what he was saying he could do.\"\nBut training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before it is processed.\nXKeyscore, the documents boast, is the NSA's \"widest reaching\" system developing intelligence from computer networks – what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\", including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata.\nAnalysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing \"real-time\" interception of an individual's internet activity.\nUnder US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a 'US person', though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst.\nOne training slide illustrates the digital activity constantly being collected by XKeyscore and the analyst's ability to query the databases at any time.\nKS1 Photograph: Guardian\nThe purpose of XKeyscore is to allow analysts to search the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity, such as browser history, even when there is no known email account (a \"selector\" in NSA parlance) associated with the individual being targeted.\nAnalysts can also search by name, telephone number, IP address, keywords, the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used.\nOne document notes that this is because \"strong selection [search by email address] itself gives us only a very limited capability\" because \"a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous.\"\nThe NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore.\nAnalysts are warned that searching the full database for content will yield too many results to sift through. Instead they are advised to use the metadata also stored in the databases to narrow down what to review.\nA slide entitled \"plug-ins\" in a December 2012 document describes the various fields of information that can be searched. It includes \"every email address seen in a session by both username and domain\", \"every phone number seen in a session (eg address book entries or signature block)\" and user activity – \"the webmail and chat activity to include username, buddylist, machine specific cookies etc\".\nEmail monitoring\nIn a second Guardian interview in June, Snowden elaborated on his statement about being able to read any individual's email if he had their email address. He said the claim was based in part on the email search capabilities of XKeyscore, which Snowden says he was authorized to use while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA.\nOne top-secret document describes how the program \"searches within bodies of emails, webpages and documents\", including the \"To, From, CC, BCC lines\" and the 'Contact Us' pages on websites\".\nTo search for emails, an analyst using XKS enters the individual's email address into a simple online search form, along with the \"justification\" for the search and the time period for which the emails are sought.\nKS2 Photograph: Guardian\nKS3edit2 Photograph: Guardian\nThe analyst then selects which of those returned emails they want to read by opening them in NSA reading software.\nThe system is similar to the way in which NSA analysts generally can intercept the communications of anyone they select, including, as one NSA document put it, \"communications that transit the United States and communications that terminate in the United States\".\nOne document, a top secret 2010 guide describing the training received by NSA analysts for general surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, explains that analysts can begin surveillance on anyone by clicking a few simple pull-down menus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications. Once options on the pull-down menus are selected, their target is marked for electronic surveillance and the analyst is able to review the content of their communications:\nKS4 Photograph: Guardian\nChats, browsing history and other internet activity\nBeyond emails, the XKeyscore system allows analysts to monitor a virtually unlimited array of other internet activities, including those within social media.\nAn NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages.\nKS55edit Photograph: Guardian\nAn analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen.\nKS6 Photograph: Guardian\nAnalysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.\nKS7 Photograph: Guardian\nAs one slide indicates, the ability to search HTTP activity by keyword permits the analyst access to what the NSA calls \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\".\nKS8 Photograph: Guardian\nThe XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.\nKS9 Photograph: Guardian\nThe quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large. One NSA report from 2007 estimated that there were 850bn \"call events\" collected and stored in the NSA databases, and close to 150bn internet records. Each day, the document says, 1-2bn records were added.\nWilliam Binney, a former NSA mathematician, said last year that the agency had \"assembled on the order of 20tn transactions about US citizens with other US citizens\", an estimate, he said, that \"only was involving phone calls and emails\". A 2010 Washington Post article reported that \"every day, collection systems at the [NSA] intercept and store 1.7bn emails, phone calls and other type of communications.\"\nThe XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: \"At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\"\nTo solve this problem, the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store \"interesting\" content in other databases, such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years. \nIt is the databases of XKeyscore, one document shows, that now contain the greatest amount of communications data collected by the NSA.\nKS10 Photograph: Guaridan\nIn 2012, there were at least 41 billion total records collected and stored in XKeyscore for a single 30-day period.\nKS11 Photograph: Guardian\nLegal v technical restrictions\nWhile the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA's foreign targets.\nThe ACLU's deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, told the Guardian last month that national security officials expressly said that a primary purpose of the new law was to enable them to collect large amounts of Americans' communications without individualized warrants.\n\"The government doesn't need to 'target' Americans in order to collect huge volumes of their communications,\" said Jaffer. \"The government inevitably sweeps up the communications of many Americans\" when targeting foreign nationals for surveillance.\nAn example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York.\nKS12 Photograph: Guardian\nIn recent years, the NSA has attempted to segregate exclusively domestic US communications in separate databases. But even NSA documents acknowledge that such efforts are imperfect, as even purely domestic communications can travel on foreign systems, and NSA tools are sometimes unable to identify the national origins of communications.\nMoreover, all communications between Americans and someone on foreign soil are included in the same databases as foreign-to-foreign communications, making them readily searchable without warrants.\nSome searches conducted by NSA analysts are periodically reviewed by their supervisors within the NSA. \"It's very rare to be questioned on our searches,\" Snowden told the Guardian in June, \"and even when we are, it's usually along the lines of: 'let's bulk up the justification'.\"\nIn a letter this week to senator Ron Wyden, director of national intelligence James Clapper acknowledged that NSA analysts have exceeded even legal limits as interpreted by the NSA in domestic surveillance.\nAcknowledging what he called \"a number of compliance problems\", Clapper attributed them to \"human error\" or \"highly sophisticated technology issues\" rather than \"bad faith\".\nHowever, Wyden said on the Senate floor on Tuesday: \"These violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community, and are troubling.\"\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the NSA said: \"NSA's activities are focused and specifically deployed against – and only against – legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests.\n\"XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.\n\"Allegations of widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks … In addition, there are multiple technical, manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring.\"\n\"Every search by an NSA analyst is fully auditable, to ensure that they are proper and within the law.\n\"These types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully – to defend the nation and to protect US and allied troops abroad.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage.

It consists of eight large LCD screens, turned on their ends and arranged in a circle, with a joystick at the centre. The screens display vivid satellite imagery from Google Earth, and the joystick permits three-dimensional \"flight\", so that stepping inside Liquid Galaxy feels like boarding your own personal UFO, in which you can zoom from the darkness of space down to the ocean's surface, cruising low over deserts, or inspecting the tops of skyscrapers. (The illusion of real movement is powerful; your legs may tremble.) You can swoop down to street-level in Cape Town, spot ships in the Mekong river, or lose yourself in the whiteness of Antarctica.\nBut you don't, of course. What you do – or what I did, anyway, but watch anyone using Google Earth for the first time, and you'll see they do the equivalent – is to hurtle across continents to the semi-detached house on the outskirts of York where you grew up, to peer down at a street you know well. In an era of previously unimagined opportunities for exploring the far-off and strange, we want mainly to stare at ourselves.\nIt is a testament to the rate of change in the world of mapping, though, that Liquid Galaxy is now essentially old hat. Google has much, much bigger plans. In June it revealed that it had already started using planes – \"military-grade spy planes\", the New York senator Charles Schumer claimed – to provide more detailed 3D imagery of the world's big cities. It also unveiled the Street View Trekker, a bulky backpack with several 15-megapixel cameras protruding on a stalk, so that operatives can capture \"offroad\" imagery from hiking trails, narrow alleyways or the forest floor. Almost every month, new kinds of data are incorporated into Google Maps: in June, it was 2,000 miles of British canal towpaths, complete with bridges and locks; it was bike lanes. And for the first time, Google's dominance of digital mapping faces a credible threat: Apple has announced that it will no longer include Google Maps on iPhones or iPads, replacing it with an alternative that, an Apple source told the tech blog All Things D, \"will blow your head off\".\n\"I honestly think we're seeing a more profound change, for mapmaking, than the switch from manuscript to print in the Renaissance,\" says the University of London cartographic historian Jerry Brotton. \"That was huge. But this is bigger.\" The transition to print gave far more people access to maps. The transition to ubiquitous digital mapping accelerates and extends that development – but it is also transforming the roles that maps play in our lives.\nThe idea of a one-to-one scale map of the world, portraying everything in it, is a venerable device in literature, surfacing most famously in the work of Lewis Carroll and Jorge Luis Borges; in Harry Potter, there's a map that shows what everyone in Hogwarts is doing at every moment. But in the era of Street View Trekker and Liquid Galaxy, these fictional maps seem somewhat less absurd – and the level of detail is only one way in which maps are changing. Increasingly, the boundary between consulting a map and interacting with the world outside it is blurring: when Google glasses, currently in prototype, can project directions, or reviews of the restaurant you're looking at, directly into your visual field, what does the word \"map\" mean anymore? While researching his forthcoming book, A History of the World in Twelve Maps, Brotton sometimes brought up the \"one-to-one map\" idea, from Borges and Carroll, with people at Google, but they didn't find it particularly witty or intriguing.\n\"Oh, yeah,\" they would reply, matter-of-factly. \"We can make that map.\"\nFor many of us, pulling out a smartphone to find the quickest route to a meeting, or to the pub, is so ubiquitous a daily habit that it's hard to remember how absurdly recently it became possible. Google Maps was launched in 2005 – \"and that was the watershed,\" says David Heyman, a founder of the cartography company Axis Maps. \"Before that, we were on that old Mapquest thing – that was just an interface for loading a static map, really. But then Google Maps comes along, and suddenly you feel like you're in this seamless interactive environment.\" It became possible for users to create \"mashups\", building sites in which Google's basic maps were overlaid with other data: information about flats for rent, or the course of international warfare throughout history, or the best Indian restaurants in Glasgow.\nA couple of years beforehand, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had been fascinated by the zooming satellite imagery used by US news networks to report on bombing raids in Iraq. Those terrain graphics were provided by Keyhole, Inc, a software company that the CIA had helped to fund. Unlike the rest of us, Page and Brin had the wherewithal to act upon their fascination: they bought Keyhole, repackaging and releasing the firm's software as Google Earth in 2005. \"They say they bought it because it looked cool,\" says Brotton. \"But my view is that they absolutely knew what they were buying. They marketed it in this touchy-feely way, as an environmental thing, and they called it 'Earth' – 'Google World' would have sounded imperialist. But they knew that what they were getting with Keyhole would be integral to the search business.\"\nThere is a sense, in fact, in which mapping is the essence of what Google does. The company likes to talk about services such as Maps and Earth as if they were providing them for fun – a neat, free extra as a reward for using their primary offering, the search box. But a search engine, in some sense, is an attempt to map the world of information – and when you can combine that conceptual world with the geographical one, the commercial opportunities suddenly explode. Search results for restaurants or doctors or taxi firms mean far more, and present far juicier opportunities for advertisers, when they are geographically relevant. And then there's the most important point – the really exciting or troubling one, depending on your perspective. In a world of GPS-enabled smartphones, you're not just consulting Google or Apple data stores when you consult a map: you're adding to them.\nExactly what information the companies collect, and what they do with it, remains much debated. But it's easy to grasp the basic commercial calculation. The more exactly your phone knows where you are, the more accurately you can be served with advertisements based on the places you'll be passing. (Ads on Google are already geo-targeted.) There's no technical reason why, perhaps in return for a cheaper phone bill, you mightn't consent to be shown not the quickest route between two points, but the quickest route that passes at least one Starbucks. If you're looking at the world through Google glasses, who determines which aspects of \"augmented reality\" data you see – and did they pay for the privilege? Combining GPS with the new Indoor Positioning System, which uses cellular and other phone data to track phones much more precisely, shops could easily track customers' movements among the aisles, adjusting displays on a day-by-day basis for maximum revenue.\n\"The map is mapping us,\" says Martin Dodge, a senior lecturer in human geography at Manchester University. \"I'm not paranoid, but I am quite suspicious and cynical about products that appear to be innocent and neutral, but that are actually vacuuming up all kinds of behavioural and attitudinal data.\"\nThis is why, to techno-zealots and sceptics alike, the media panic over maps and privacy seems rather misplaced. \"Barbecuing or sunbathing in your backyard shouldn't be a public event,\" New York's senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"People should be free of the worry of some hi-tech peeping tom technology violating one's privacy when in your own home.\" German law allows individuals to request the blurring of their homes on Street View. (\"You have digitally desecrated your cities,\" the new-media commentator Jeff Jarvis responded in fury.) Certainly, this debate matters. But it's hard to interpret the occasional aerial snapshot of your garden as a big issue when the phone in your pocket is assembling a real-time picture of your movements, preferences and behaviour.\nGoogle and Apple insist, plausibly enough, that they're not interested in anyone's individual data: the commercial value lies in the patterns they can detect in the aggregate. But you'd be forgiven for not being entirely reassured. In any case, the concern that someone else might discover certain things about you isn't necessarily the most disorienting implication of the new generation of maps. More dizzying is the thought that – as maps based on mined data come to shape our sense of space, to navigate our journeys, and to narrow our online searches – Google's and Apple's maps might not just observe our lives, but in some sense come to play a role in directing their course.\n\"There's kind of a fine line that you run,\" said Ed Parsons, Google's chief geospatial technologist, in a session at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, \"between this being really useful, and it being creepy.\"\nFor some, the ubiquity of maps – the way they are seeping into every corner of our \"real\", concrete world – triggers more nebulous, philosophical worries. With maps always in our pockets, or literally in front of our eyes, might we lose the ability to wander, and to get lost? If we're constantly glancing at our phones, or being bombarded by extra layers of data about where we're going, won't we become disconnected from the world around us? Is there something beneficial in having to stop to ask directions – an experience that will probably all but vanish, for most of us, in the next few years?\nCartographers don't seem to see things this way. \"I actually think it's easier to get lost these days,\" says Heyman. \"Now, when I get to a new city, I can walk off wherever I like, without caring, because I know I'll be able to get back, consequence-free.\" And the idea that we're losing touch with reality doesn't hold water, argues Brotton. \"It's actually much more interesting than that.\" The really important question is: who controls the specific filters on which we're increasingly coming to rely? \"Google and Apple are saying that they want control over people's real and imagined space.\"\nWhich brings us to the core of the matter. It can be easy to assume that maps are objective: that the world is out there, and that a good map is one that represents it accurately. But that's not true. Any square mile of the planet can be described in an infinite number of ways: in terms of its natural features, its weather, its socio-economic profile, or what you can buy in the shops there. Traditionally, the interests reflected in maps have been those of states and their armies, because they were the ones who did the mapmaking, and the primary use of many such maps was military. (If you had the better maps, you stood a good chance of winning the battle. The Ordnance Survey's logo still includes a visual reference to the 18th-century War Department.) Now, the power is shifting. \"Every map,\" the cartography curator Lucy Fellowes once said, \"is someone's way of getting you to look at the world his or her way.\" What happens when we come to see the world, to a significant extent, through the eyes of a handful of big companies based in California? You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist, or an anti-corporate crusader, to wonder about the subtle ways in which their values and interests might come to shape our lives.\nThe question cartographers are always being asked at cocktail parties, says Heyman, is whether there's really any mapmaking still left to do: we've mapped the whole planet already, haven't we? The question could hardly be more misconceived. We are just beginning to grasp what it means to live in a world in which maps are everywhere – and in which, by using maps, we are mapped ourselves.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage.

{"num":12,"Time":"5 minute read\nUpdated 10:44 AM EST, Wed February 29, 2012","Title":"How to prepare for Google’s privacy changes","Content":"STORY HIGHLIGHTS\nGoogle privacy policy change goes into effect Thursday\nThe change lets Google combine data on you from all of its sites\nUsers can delete Web, search history before the change happens\nDeleting history doesn't mean Google can't use the info internally\nCNN\n — \nOn Thursday, Google’s much-discussed new privacy policy goes into effect.\nTo say that the change has stirred concern on the Web would be an understatement. Public officials and Web watchdogs in the United States and elsewhere have expressed fears that it will mean less privacy for users of the Web giant’s multitude of products, from search to Gmail to YouTube to Google Maps to smartphones powered by the Android operating system.\nGoogle points out that the products won’t be collecting any more data about users than they were before. And, in fairness, the company has gone out of its way to prominently announce the product across all of its platforms for weeks.\nThe major change is that, instead of profiling users separately on each of its sites and products, Google will now pull all of that information together into one single profile, similar to what’s found on Google’s dashboard page.\nThe result encapsulates perhaps the most basic conundrum of the modern Web. More information means better service (and potentially, more targeted advertisements). But that service (in this case more accurate search results, more interesting ads and new features that work across multiple sites) requires you to give up some of your privacy in return.\nVIDEO\nHow to turn off Google's web history\nVIDEO\nPrivacy watchdogs sound alarm on Google\nVIDEO\nGoogle tracks unknowing Apple users\nFederal Trade Commission Chairman Jon Leibowitz has called it “a somewhat brutal choice.”\nGoogle, not surprisingly, takes a different tack: The payoff for the company collecting your data is cool new services. For example, they could push cooking videos to you on YouTube if you’d been looking for recipes through Google search, privacy director Alma Whitten wrote in an editorial for the Sacramento Bee.\n“We just want to use the information you already trust us with to make your experience better,” she wrote. “If you don’t think information sharing will improve your experience, you don’t need to sign in to use services like Search, Maps and YouTube.\n“If you are signed in, you can use our many privacy tools to do things like edit or turn off your search history, control the way Google tailors ads to your interests and browse the Web ‘incognito’ using Chrome.”\nWednesday is the last day for people to tweak those Google settings before the new policy begins, although they can change them afterward as well.\nHere are a few tips on how to keep your data a little more private on some of Google’s most popular features.\nDon’t sign in\nThis is the easiest and most effective tip.\nMany of Google’s services – most notably search, YouTube and Maps – don’t require you to sign in to use them. If you’re not logged in, via Gmail or Google+, for example, Google doesn’t know who you are and can’t add data to your profile.\nBut to take a little more direct action …\nRemoving your Google search history\nEva Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation has compiled a step-by-step guide to deleting and disabling your Web History, which includes the searches you’ve done and sites you’ve visited.\nIt’s pretty quick and easy:\n– Sign in to your Google account\n– Go to www.google.com\/history\n– Click “Remove all Web History”\n– Click “OK”\nAs the EFF notes, deleting your history will not prevent Google from using the information internally. But it will limit the amount of time that it’s fully accessible. After 18 months, the data will become anonymous again and won’t be used as part of your profile.\nSix tips to protect your search privacy (from the EFF)\nClearing your YouTube history\nSimilarly, users may want to remove their history on YouTube. That’s also pretty quick and easy.\n– Sign in on Google’s main page\n– Click on “YouTube” in the toolbar at the top of the page\n– On the right of the page, click your user name and select “Video Manager”\n– Click “History” on the left of the page and then “Clear Viewing History”\n– Refresh the page and then click “Pause Viewing History”\n– You can clear your searches on YouTube by going back and choosing “Clear Search History” and doing the same steps.\nClearing your browsing history on Google Chrome\n– Click on the “wrench” icon at the far right of your toolbar\n– Select “Tools”\n– Select “Clear browsing data”\n– In the dialogue box that appears, click the “clear browsing data” box (there are other options you may want to use as well)\n– Select “Beginning of Time” to clear your entire browsing history\n– Click “clear browsing history”\nGmail Chat\nWhen you start a chat with someone, you can make the conversation “off the record.” Off-the-record chats will not be stored in your chat history or the history of the person with whom you’re talking. All chats with that person will remain off the record until you change the status. To go off the record:\n– Click the “Actions” link at the top right of the chat window\n– Scroll down to “Go off the record.” Both you and your chat partner will see that the chat has been taken off the record.\nWhat are Google’s other products?\nObviously, anything with “Google” in its name counts. But the Web giant owns other products that might not be so obvious to some folks.\n– Gmail. Yes, the “G” is for Google.\n– YouTube. Google bought the Web’s leading video site in 2006\n– Picasa. The online photo sharing site became Google’s in 2004\n– Blogger. The blog publishing tool has been Google’s since 2003.\n– FeedBurner. A management tool for bloggers and managing RSS feeds. Google bought it in 2007.\n– Orkut. Google’s original social-networking site isn’t big in the U.S. But it’s one of the most popular sites in India and Brazil.\n– Android. Yes, you probably know this. But just for the record, Google owns the most popular smartphone operating system.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage.

{"num":11,"Time":"Thu 21 Jul 2022 17.00 CEST","Title":"Google under scrutiny over pledge to protect abortion location data","Content":"Google’s promise to protect the location history of users who visit abortion clinics is coming under scrutiny after researchers found that a user who had brief access to another user’s Android phone – such as a boyfriend logging into his girlfriend’s phone – could relatively easily monitor the user’s movements.\nThe finding by Tech Transparency Project, a research arm of the non-profit Campaign for Accountability, comes weeks after Google announced in a blogpost that it would delete entries to sensitive locations – such as abortion clinics or domestic violence shelters – if its systems identified that someone has visited one of these places. The 1 July blogpost said the change would take effect “in the coming weeks”.\nTech company earnings reports expected to bring a flush of bad news\nRead more\nThe supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that ensured women had a federally protected right to get an abortion, has prompted concerns among privacy advocates about data collection policies that could be used to track women by their intimate partners or by law enforcement agencies in the event she was seeking access to an abortion.\nIn a report published on Thursday, TTP researchers made two findings after an experiment using two new Android phones. First, if an Android user (described as a “perpetrator”) could get access to another user’s phone (described as a “victim”) and log into their own account using a Google app on the victim’s device, such as Google Play, the location history of the victim would then be visible to the perpetrator, without the victim being given any clear warning that they could be tracked.\nSecond, the same experiment showed that the victim’s visit to an abortion clinic, a Washington-based Planned Parenthood, was visible to the perpetrator and was not automatically deleted. In this case, the victim’s location history was turned off, but the perpetrator’s was enabled.\nThe route and time spent in the Planned Parenthood clinic was also viewable to the perpetrator via the Google Maps app on the perpetrator’s phone. A full week later, the clinic location remained in Google’s location history when viewed on the perpetrator’s phone and in a desktop browser.\nTTP said: “It is unclear how Google plans to implement these [abortion-related] policies, and how long sensitive locations will remain on users’ location timelines before the tech giant deletes them.\n“When TTP took a phone to an abortion clinic, the clinic’s exact location remained in Google’s location history for more than a week, suggesting that either Google has not yet implemented these changes or the company’s system for detecting and removing sensitive locations is faulty.”\nTTP’s experiment replicated a similar finding that was published by a respected malware intelligence researcher, Pieter Arntz, on his blog in 2021. In that case, Arntz reported that he had inadvertently been able to “spy” on his wife’s whereabouts after he installed an app on his wife’s Android phone, which ultimately led him to receive updates on her location on his own phone.\nArntz said he submitted an issue report to Google with specific information about how he had obtained the location information, and made suggestions about how the company could take steps to protect users’ location data from inadvertently being shared. In his case, as in TTP’s experiment, the Google timeline was enabled on his phone but not on his wife’s, so he noted that he should not have been able to receive the locations visited by her phone.\nSecond, he said that his wife should have received an explicit warning that “someone else logged into [a Google app] on your phone”.\nContacted by the Guardian, Arntz said Google never responded to his issue report or to his blogpost, even though the blogpost received a lot of attention from privacy experts at the time it was published.\nKatie Paul, director of TTP, said: “Google was told that its own tools could be used for stalking nearly a year ago, and the company did nothing about it. The problem has only grown more urgent since then. We have a duty to warn people about how easy it is for someone to track them without their knowledge or consent.”\nResearchers have also pointed out that Reddit forums include posts from users who discuss how they discovered partners were cheating on them because they were logged in to their partner’s mobile phone via Gmail or other apps.\nPaul added: “Google says it wants to protect women by removing abortion clinics from their location histories. Our study shows they haven’t done that. Even if they eventually make good on that promise, abusers can still use Google tools to follow their victims everywhere else in the world. It’s up to Google to close this dangerous loophole.”\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Google called TTP’s experiment an “unlikely scenario” because it would require an unwanted user to access a device, breach someone’s device security, and have the user not realize another account is logged in.\nA Google spokesperson said: “We encourage everyone to regularly check the accounts associated with their device and only share their device password with people they trust. We make it easy for you to check and manage the accounts associated with your device from any Google app, including removing any unwanted or unknown account.\n“We’re always looking at ways to provide people with more controls and protections in every scenario, however unlikely.”\nThe spokesperson added: “Location History is a Google Account-level setting that is off by default, and we provide simple tools to help you delete any of your data or set auto-delete controls.\n“As we announced earlier this month, if our systems identify that someone who has opted into Location History visits an abortion clinic, among other places, we will delete these entries from Location History soon after they visit. The change is now in effect and will apply to all such visits moving forward.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"Google’s promise to protect the location history of users who visit abortion clinics is coming under scrutiny\",\n\"a user who had brief access to another user’s Android phone could relatively easily monitor the user’s movements\",\n\"The supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade has prompted concerns among privacy advocates\",\n\"if an Android user could get access to another user’s phone and log into their own account using a Google app on the victim’s device, the location history of the victim would then be visible to the perpetrator\",\n\"the victim’s visit to an abortion clinic was visible to the perpetrator and was not automatically deleted\",\n\"the clinic location remained in Google’s location history for more than a week\",\n\"TTP’s experiment replicated a similar finding that was published by a respected malware intelligence researcher\",\n\"Reddit forums include posts from users who discuss how they discovered partners were cheating on them because they were logged in to their partner’s mobile phone via Gmail or other apps\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2022\/jul\/21\/google-abortion-privacy-location-history","query_name":"updated_file_Mapping_Application_Search_and_Navigation_History_Privacy.xlsx"}
{"num":4,"Time":"Fri 20 Dec 2013 08.23 CET","Title":"Android's permissions gap: why has it fallen so far behind Apple's iOS?","Content":"No piece of technology knows as much about you as your smartphone. It goes where you do, so knows your movements, holds your contacts, your mesages, emails, web browsing records - and all the apps you use, perhaps including credit card details (suitably obfuscated to prevent casual theft). Given untrammelled access to someone's smartphone, you could find out almost everything about their life.\nSmartphones are intensely personal (which is also why people can get so worked up if they think you're insulting their choice of smartphone; it's tantamount to insulting their personality). And when it comes to data, the events of the past six months - starting with the Guardian's revelations about NSA and GCHQ surveillance - have heightened peoples' awareness of the idea that it is their own data.\nIn fact the Information Commissioner's Office released app guidelines on Thursday which pointed out that these concerns are becoming significant:\nA survey of 2,272 British people conducted by YouGov and commissioned by the ICO found that 59% have downloaded apps, but that 62% of them are concerned about resulting privacy issues. Over 40% said they have decided not to download at least one app due to these fears.\nSo why would you let an app get that sort of access to your contacts, location, or storage? If you're using Android, the answer is that you don't get much choice, unless (like those 40%+ in the survey) you decide not to download the app. And the peculiar thing is that Google seems to be quite OK with that - and in fact has gone as far as to reverse an update which let users block apps from accessing data they shouldn't.\nThe consequences of that are already beginning to play out as people notice the difference - and complain in the only way they can, by giving apps lower ratings for what they see as excessive demands.\nThe problem surfaced at the end of last week, when the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) first praised and then doled out brickbats to Google for implementing, and then reversing, a function which allowed users to set per-app permissions to data such as their contacts, call log, location and so on. To access it you had to download a free third-party app called App Ops Launcher.\nOnce you installed and ran it, you could see and control all sorts of individual permissions - as shown below.\nApp Ops allowed users of Android 4.3 to fine-tune app permissions.\nBut the exposure of App Ops had only a short life. Bip! There it was in Android 4.3, which arrived in mid-November. Bam! There it was, gone in Android 4.4.2, released about three weeks later.\nIn fact it only seems to have appeared in 4.3 by virtue of a brief edit war in the Android code tree between Dianne Hackborn, an Android product manager, and Dave Burke. Hackborn removed the feature on 1 August; Burke put it back in the next day. The change made it through, but then was reversed once again, and 4.4.2 rolled out to squash it. And according to app developers, 4.4.2 properly kills App Ops: it simply won't function unless you take the extreme measure of rooting your phone. (Very, very few people do this.)\nThe upshot is that Android users once again can't control what permissions an app takes for itself - unless they reject the app wholesale ahead of installation.\nAnd the effects of that reversal are showing up. OpenSignal, a crowdsourcing app which feeds back data about signal strength in various location, has suddenly seen a rash of bad reviews, says James Robinson, the company's chief technology officer. \"The decline is all due to poor ratings on Android 4.4, where the ratings have dived from 4.3 to less than 4 in under a week,\" says Robinson.\nHe points to flaws in how 4.4.2 records changes to requests for permissions: though it appears to ask for access to USB storage, contacts, messages, phone status (which appears as \"phone calls\", location and network communication (\"connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi\"). The app, he says, used to need \"Read Contacts\" permission before Android 4.1 to count how much time you'd spent on calls; \"Call Logs\" was added later. And he's insistent that it never reads SMS or contacts.\nBut the bad reviews have been coming in - and in a number of cases they're related to the app's apparent demand to read contacts.\nThe reviews also show that nobody knows why the app might want to access your contacts - but they do want to block it.\nThe bizarre thing is that Android, which has always led Apple's iOS in terms of customisation - choose your own keyboard, choose your own default apps - has now lagged in this key area by more than a year, in a field where people have become more and more aware that data matters, and permission matters - and the ability to revoke permission matters even more.\nPath to problems\nAndroid used to be ahead of Apple's iOS by virtue of the fact that it did at least tell you what elements of your phone an app might access. That was in stark contrast to iOS, where before 2012 you didn't actually know what an app was up to after you downloaded it. That led to the furore in February 2012 when it was revealed that the social startup Path was grabbing iPhone address books and uploading them to its servers.\nPath said sorry (raising the question of why it needed to be sorry for something that obviously wasn't an accident; shouldn't it have just not done it in the first place?). But the fallout was considerable.\nPath was subsequently fined $800,000 by the FTC. Apple faced a congressional inquiry. But it took action: in September 2012 iOS 6 let you block apps' access to system-wide elements such as location, contacts books, Twitter and Facebook. (In 2013 it added microphone access to the controllable elements.)\nThe result is that any time app tries to access your contacts, or location, or photos without your having given permission, you'll be asked whether to allow it or not. You can simply block apps from ever getting access.\nPermission not denied\nBut Android, which was on version 4.1 in July 2012, hasn't done anything about permissions.\nThat has led directly to user problems such as the Brightest Flashlight Free app, which grabbed the location and device ID of millions of people in order to show them ads - even if they didn't agree to it. And there are still thousands of pieces of Android malware about which exploit the fact that nobody really understands why apps are so demanding in permissions.\nYet when you add in the revelations about the NSA and GCHQ's surveillance of citizens, and that the NSA allegedly spied on Angela Merkel's phone, it creates an atmosphere where people are less willing to let their smartphone - which is, remember, the most personal device you own - be open to all and sundry.\nGoogle, however, doesn't seem to be hearing this. In a Google+ thread, Hackborn defended her actions. (Google+ is now the only place where you will find out what Google engineers are thinking.)\n\"It wasn't intended to be available [to users]. The architecture is used for a growing number of things, but it is not intended to be exposed as a big low-level UI [user interface] of a big bunch of undifferentiated knobs you can twiddle.\"\nShe suggested that the per-app settings are \"mostly for platform engineers… maybe some day for third party developers.\"\nThis didn't really wash with the people in the thread, who all appear to be Android users, and had plenty of counter-examples to explain why they most certainly did want some undifferentiated knobs they could twiddle. Such as Jon Sykes, who pointed out:\nThe Facebook app is a perfect example of an app I want to have , but refused to install on my phone because of the excessive permissions it wants:\nDirectly call phone numbers\nRecord audio\nRead call log\nWrite call log\nDownload files without notification\nRetrieve running apps\nDraw over other apps\nPrevent phone from sleeping\nTurn sync on and off\nInstall shortcuts\nSend sticky broadcast\nNot one of those is justified for Facebook to show me updates from friends and family. Being able to go in and turn them all off is exactly what Android needs to let users do.\nPossibly Facebook wants those permissions so that it can run Facebook Home, but the problem with the Android model is you just don't know. And moreover, without App Ops and 4.3, there's no way to prevent that short of not installing the app (as Sykes did). And even though Android is good in the way that it does tell you what an app will demand to access, it's terrible in letting you know why apps want that access.\nincreasing wariness\nAny iOS user will be alerted to its privacy settings the first time an app tries to access something, whether it's location or contacts. The more technical Android users are clearly pained to be passed by Apple - especially in the provision of knobs you can twiddle.\niOS users can revoke or allow app permissions\nHackborn's tone comes across as exasperation and faint disdain that people should want to be able to change such settings. She seems to be underestimating a significant chunk of Android users.\nQuite why Hackborn is so against the idea of people having this sort of control is a puzzle. Google has officially described the exposure of the App Ops interface as \"experimental\", and there have been indications that it's worried that apps might crash if denied access to data they expect.\n\"We aren't attempting to break anything for users,\" Hackborn insisted. \"We are fixing security holes in the platform that developers have been using to get access to parts of the system that were never intended to be accessible.\"\nExcept they aren't really security holes. App Ops doesn't exploit a security hole; it just exposes something that's already there. By removing access, Hackborn is making security worse, not better.\nShe said that the UI for App Ops \"is there for platform development purposes. There isn't really much utility for third party developers. As I said, App Ops is a part of the platform framework that is being used for an increasing number of things, which are visible in the UI - per-app notification control, location access history, current SMS app - and this UI is just a tool for people working on the platform itself to more easily debug and interact with it.\"\nBut why should that only be for developers? Don't users want to be able to control it too? Remember, if the response is \"but users don't care about that stuff, and would find it confusing\", Apple does make that stuff available. If Apple users can understand it, so can Android users. And the ICO survey shows that this lack of control is hurting Android developers - over 40% of people in its survey have decided not to download an app because of the data it wants. Given that iOS doesn't tell you what permissions an app will request, it can only be Android that they're referring to.\nThere's another argument that defenders of the current poor state of Android's permissions put forward: apps would crash if denied such permissions. That might be true, but it suggests that the apps (and\/or Android's APIs) are poorly written: if they \"need\" access to your contacts, what happens if you don't have any contacts? If they \"need\" network access, what happens when that's off? If they \"need\" access to your call logs, what happens if those are blank? Android must return some sort of result in that case, and the fact that users of App Ops on 4.3 didn't storm the barricades complaining about crashing apps suggests that this isn't a problem.\nAnd to those who say \"you should just download a Permissions App\" - implicitly acknowledging that the problem exists, but that you have to fix it on your personal device, not the maker of the software - that in turn suggests that apps won't crash left, right and centre if denied permissions. Which in turn suggests that Hackborn's description of \"security holes\" doesn't stand up. The security holes are the ones allowing apps to siphon your data, not the existence of App Ops.\nFurthermore, the claim (also made) that \"if the permissions change, I can just get rid of the app\" points to the problem highlighted by OpenSignal above: 4.4.2 doesn't actually give the correct information about permissions changes.\nFollow the money?\nIt's known that Google makes its money from pulling in data from users of smartphones - an increasingly important sector. That's why the loss of maps provision on Apple's iPhones (and to a lesser extent iPads) was such a blow, though Google Search is still the default on iOS. (One might wonder: for how long? Would an incoming chief executive at Microsoft make a better offer than Google for Bing to become the default search on iOS?)\nSo is the reason why it hasn't given users more control over their data that doing so would threaten its revenue stream from Android?\nOr is it that, as it tries to take more control of Android by removing various elements from the open-source Android code (AOSP) - which now lacks a browser among other things - that it also wants to take this privacy control out, and make it a separate downloadable app, as Google Play is?\nThat doesn't seem likely; I asked the team at CyanogenMod (who have their own Privacy Guard software which exposes the App Ops interface) whether you could take that functionality out and re-enable it with an app. The consensus was that virtually impossible given the Unix model that Android is built on.\nSo where does that leave Android? Still without a decent permissions model, unless you're running 4.3 - which, according to Google's own statistics, is just 4.2% of those whose devices accessed Google Play in the last week of November.\nThat leaves a whopping 95.8% of Android users - probably a billion or so - who can't control whether rogue apps grab their data, nor what they do with it. Contrast that to Apple's figures for the proportion of devices using iOS 6 or above - 96% - and you have a stark contrast in the platforms' approach to apps and data.\nUpdate: added extract from article about the Information Commissioner's survey on app privacy and guidelines.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage.

{"num":3,"Time":"NOVEMBER 2, 2017","Title":"App developer access to iPhone X face data spooks some privacy experts","Content":"By Stephen Nellis\n7 MIN READ\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O won accolades from privacy experts in September for assuring that facial data used to unlock its new iPhone X would be securely stored on the phone itself.\n Privacy concerns loom over iPhone X\n01:45\nBut Apple’s privacy promises do not extend to the thousands of app developers who will gain access to facial data in order to build entertainment features for iPhone X customers, such as pinning a three-dimensional mask to their face for a selfie or letting a video game character mirror the player’s real-world facial expressions.\nApple allows developers to take certain facial data off the phone as long as they agree to seek customer permission and not sell the data to third parties, among other terms in a contract seen by Reuters.\nApp makers who want to use the new camera on the iPhone X can capture a rough map of a user’s face and a stream of more than 50 kinds of facial expressions. This data, which can be removed from the phone and stored on a developer’s own servers, can help monitor how often users blink, smile or even raise an eyebrow.\nThat remote storage raises questions about how effectively Apple can enforce its privacy rules, according to privacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Democracy and Technology. Apple maintains that its enforcement tools - which include pre-publication reviews, audits of apps and the threat of kicking developers off its lucrative App Store - are effective.\nThe data available to developers cannot unlock a phone; that process relies on a mathematical representation of the face rather than a visual map of it, according to documentation about the face unlock system that Apple released to security researchers.\nBut the relative ease with which developers can whisk away face data to remote servers leaves Apple sending conflicting messages: Face data is highly private when used for authentication, but it is sharable - with the user’s permission - when used to build app features.\n“The privacy issues around of the use of very sophisticated facial recognition technology for unlocking the phone have been overblown,” said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union. “The real privacy issues have to do with the access by third-party developers.”\nThe use of face recognition is becoming ubiquitous on everything from social networks to city streets with surveillance cameras. Berlin law enforcement officials in August installed a facial recognition system at the city’s main railway station to test new technology for catching criminals and terrorists.\nBut privacy concerns loom large. In Illinois, Facebook Inc FB.O faces a lawsuit over whether its photo tagging suggestions violated a state law that bars the collection of biometric data without permission. Facebook says it has always been clear with users that it can be turned off and the data for it deleted.\nPrivacy experts say their concerns about iPhone X are not about government snooping, since huge troves of facial photographs already exist on social media and even in state motor vehicle departments. The issue is more about unscrupulous marketers eager to track users’ facial expressions in response to advertisements or content, despite Apple’s contractual rules against doing so.\nA attendee uses a new iPhone X during a presentation for the media in Beijing, China October 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter\nApp makers must “obtain clear and conspicuous consent” from users before collecting or storing face data, and can only do so for a legitimate feature of an app, according to the relevant portions of Apple’s developer agreement that Apple provided to Reuters.\nApple’s iOS operating system also asks users to grant permission for an app to access to any of the phone’s cameras.\nApple forbids developers from using the face data for advertising or marketing, and from selling it to data brokers or analytics firms that might use it for those purposes. The company also bans the creation of user profiles that could be used to identify anonymous users, according to its developer agreement.\n“The bottom line is, Apple is trying to make this a user experience addition to the iPhone X, and not an advertising addition,” said Clare Garvie, an associate with the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington.\nENFORCEMENT IN QUESTION\nThough they praised Apple’s policies on face data, privacy experts worry about the potential inability to control what app developers do with face data once it leaves the iPhone X, and whether the tech company’s disclosure policies adequately alert customers.\nThe company has had high-profile mishaps enforcing its own rules in the past, such as the 2012 controversy around Path, a social networking app that was found to be saving users’ contact lists to its servers, a violation of Apple’s rules.\nOne app developer told Reuters that Apple’s non-negotiable developer agreement is long and complex and rarely read in detail, just as most consumers do not know the details of what they agree to when they allow access to personal data.\nApple’s main enforcement mechanism is the threat to kick apps out of the App Store, though the company in 2011 told the U.S. Congress that it had never punished an app in that way for sharing user information with third parties without permission.\nApple’s other line of defense against privacy abuse is the review that all apps undergo before they hit the App Store. But the company does not review the source code of all apps, instead relying on random spot checks or complaints, according to 2011 Congressional testimony from Bud Tribble, one of the company’s “privacy czars.”\nWith the iPhone X, the primary danger is that advertisers will find it irresistible to gauge how consumers react to products or to build tracking profiles of them, even though Apple explicitly bans such activity. “Apple does have a pretty good historical track record of holding developers accountable who violate their agreements, but they have to catch them first - and sometimes that’s the hard part,” the ACLU’s Stanley said. “It means household names probably won’t exploit this, but there’s still a lot of room for bottom feeders.”\nReporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the analysis of the provided news article in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": [\n    \"The news is relevant to privacy concerns.\",\n    \"The article discusses how Apple allows app developers access to facial data from iPhone X users.\",\n    \"App developers can capture a rough map of a user's face and various facial expressions, which can be stored on their own servers.\",\n    \"Privacy groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Democracy and Technology, have raised concerns about the potential privacy implications of this access.\",\n    \"While the data cannot unlock the phone itself, it can be used to build app features like tracking users' facial expressions in response to advertisements or content.\",\n    \"Apple has guidelines in place, requiring app developers to seek user permission and not sell the data to third parties, among other terms.\",\n    \"The article also mentions concerns about Apple's ability to enforce these privacy rules effectively, given the ease with which developers can store facial data remotely.\",\n    \"The primary concern is not government snooping but the potential misuse of facial data by marketers and advertisers, despite Apple's contractual rules.\",\n    \"Privacy experts worry about Apple's ability to control what app developers do with facial data once it leaves the iPhone X.\",\n    \"Apple's enforcement mechanisms include the threat of removing apps from the App Store and app reviews, but these may not be foolproof.\",\n    \"The article mentions that some app developers may not fully understand or read Apple's complex developer agreement, similar to how consumers may not fully understand the details of their data access agreements.\"\n  ]\n}\nThis news article is relevant to privacy concerns as it discusses the access that app developers have to facial data from iPhone X users and raises concerns about the potential misuse of this data for tracking user reactions to content and advertisements.

Google has said that its Street View cars no longer collect any type of wireless information.\nOn Wednesday, Google said it welcomed the FTC decision. “As we’ve said before and as we’ve assured the FTC, we did not want and have never used the payload data in any of our products or services,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nJoseph Turow, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication, said the data collection showed that someone else could scrape up the same information for malicious reasons.\n“I think that this will be seen as another one of the steps along the way that expose the tenuousness of security,” he said. “I never thought that this was anything more than Google screwing up but the implications are pretty heavy.”\nReporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Gerald E.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\nThe proposed class action lawsuit, filed on behalf of two plaintiffs who downloaded comScore software, also says comScore scans all files on users’ personal computers and modifies security settings, among other allegations.\nThe lawsuit against comScore, one of the leading companies that measures and analyzes Internet traffic, seeks an injunction against several alleged practices, as well as damages under U.S. electronic communications privacy laws.\nComScore collects data from people who get free software and chances to enter sweepstakes in exchange for their participation. It sells that information to more than 1,800 businesses around the world, including Best Buy Co, Facebook, Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc, according to comScore’s website.\nConcerns have surfaced about comScore’s data collection practices in the past, though the complaint filed on Tuesday by Chicago-based law firm Edelson McGuire appears to be the first such legal action taken against the company.\nThe lawsuit says comScore’s software scans all accessible files on a user’s computer, as well as all files from other users on the same network, and transmits information about those files back to the company.\n“We have reviewed the lawsuit and find it to be without merit and full of factual inaccuracies,” said comScore spokesman Andrew Lipsman. “ComScore intends to aggressively defend itself against these claims.”\nPrivacy advocates have grown more concerned about data collection, inadvertent or not, as people increasingly transfer tasks from shopping to banking onto the Internet.\nLast year, Google Inc was criticized for its Street View cars, which roam city streets for mapping purposes, because they accidentally collected reams of data from open, unsecured Wi-Fi networks.\nURGE TO PURGE\nComScore warns visitors to its premieropinion.com website that its software monitors all Internet activity, including filling a shopping basket, completing an application form or checking online accounts.\n“We make commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential, personally identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and account numbers,” the warning says.\n“Inadvertently, we may collect such information about our panelists; and when this happens, we make commercially viable efforts to purge our database of such information.”\nIn a 2008 blog post, comScore chairman Gian Fulgoni said the company obtains consent from people before installing data collection software, and that it does not disclose personally identifiable information to its clients.\nComScore data is routinely cited in media reports about consumer preferences and social networking website use, among other topics.\nThe company’s biggest customer is Microsoft, which accounted for about 11 percent of the $175 million it took in last year. Media companies like News Corp are also clients, according to the lawsuit, as is Reuters parent company Thomson Reuters Corp.\nThe lawsuit does not accuse comScore clients of any wrongdoing. Best Buy, Microsoft and Thomson Reuters spokespeople declined to comment. Representatives for Facebook, Yahoo and News Corp were unavailable to comment.\nEMBEDDED\nAccording to the lawsuit, comScore attracts some users by advertising on websites. But the lawsuit also accuses comScore of using subsidiaries with innocuous names to disseminate its software and gain access to millions of consumers’ computers and networks.\nComScore software is embedded in free screensavers, games and other applications without proper notice, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in a Chicago federal court.\nOnce downloaded, comScore software modifies a computer’s firewall settings and gains full rights to access and change any file on the computer, the lawsuit says.\nIt is nearly impossible to disable the software once it is installed, the lawsuit says.\nJay Edelson, an attorney who represents the plaintiffs, said his firm began its investigation of comScore in July 2010.\n“We retained multiple digital forensic firms, who each conducted dozens of independent tests,” Edelson said.\nThe case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, is Mike Harris and Jeff Dunstan, individually, and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals v. comScore Inc, case no. 11-cv-5807.\nEditing by Ted Kerr and Robert MacMillan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Based on the provided news article, it appears to be relevant to privacy concerns and potential privacy leakage.

{"num":51,"Time":"Wed 15 Sep 2021 07.00 CEST","Title":"NHS app storing facial verification data via contract with firm linked to Tory donors","Content":"The NHS app is collecting and storing facial verification data from citizens in England in a process which has fuelled concerns about transparency and accountability.\nThe data collection is taking place under a contract with a company linked to Tory donors called iProov, awarded by NHS Digital in 2019, which has yet to be published on the government website.\nPrivacy campaigners say the opacity of the relationship between London-based iProov and the government raises questions about how securely the information is held, with one saying they were “deeply concerned” about the secrecy surrounding the use of data.\nAn NHS spokesperson confirmed law enforcement bodies were able to request data, but that a special panel reviewed such requests, taking into account the health service’s duty of confidence.\nThe number of users reached 10m this year after the app was adapted to act as a Covid-19 passport. It is used to access medical records and book GP appointments, as well as obtain certificates which prove an individual’s vaccine status for overseas travel, or for entry to events such as football matches. The number of users has grown by six million since the Covid pass was introduced in mid-May. The app is separate from the official NHS Covid-19 app, which acts as a contact tracer.\nThe app asks some users for video facial verification by default, although it is possible to opt out of the process.\nThe process involves new users recording a video of their face. The video is sent to iProov which compares the facial data with anonymised photo IDs already held by the government. Its Flashmark software beams a one-off sequence of colours at the user’s face, through their phone, to ensure they are genuinely present during the verification process.\nThe app also asks users to upload their date of birth, postcode, phone number and a photo of either their passport or driving licence during the sign-up process. Only a photo clipped from the ID document is supplied to IProov.\nBoth iProov and NHS Digital stressed that app users’ biometric data is anonymised and guarded via the best possible security protection, audited by the NHS. IProov insists its customers implement a “privacy firewall” to ensure it has no visibility whatsoever of the identity of the people it verifies, apart from their faces, which is the service it provides.\nHowever, NHS Digital said it had not published its contract with iProov “for security reasons”. It also cited security as a reason for not publishing a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) of the NHS app, the document that explains how individuals’ information will be used, stored and protected.\nIProov said it could not disclose how long it holds facial data for. The NHS said the information is “not stored for longer than is necessary under the contract”.\nOne expert in surveillance law, who asked not to be named, said such information was likely to be desirable to UK and foreign intelligence services.\n“If GCHQ acquired it and it was of use, the likely position is that they would share that with the [US] National Security Agency,” they said.\nJake Hurfurt, head of research and investigations at civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: “We’re deeply concerned by the secrecy surrounding facial verification and data flows in the NHS app, particularly given the involvement of a private company.\n“It raises questions about how private and secure anyone’s information is when using facial verification and the NHS login. Anyone who sends personal information to a private company, at the encouragement of the NHS, has a right to know exactly what happens to their data.”\nDr Stephanie Hare, author of Technology Ethics, said: “Transparency, explainability and accountability are the holy trinity of technology ethics and they fall down on every one of them.”\nLondon-based iProov has previously won contracts with HM Revenue & Customs and worked on the Home Office’s “settled status” Brexit scheme for EU citizens who wish to remain in the UK.\nIt is also linked to Conservative donors. The company has received financial backing from private equity group JRJ, which has a seat on the board after investing in 2015 and 2019, the year iProov won its first NHS contract.\nJRJ counts two Tory party benefactors among its three partners. One, the former Lehman Brothers executive Jeremy Isaacs, made 26 donations totalling £661,500 to the party and its MPs between June 2006 and February 2021.\nHis fellow JRJ partner, Roger Nagioff, donated 15 times between May 2004 and February 2020, giving £448,500. JRJ did not return a request for comment but a source familiar with its investment said JRJ owned less than 10% of iProov and had no involvement in the NHS contract.\nThe iProov board includes data security experts and a veteran of Her Majesty’s Government Communications Centre (HMGCC), which has developed surveillance technology for the government.\nEddie Alleyn, a non-executive director, joined the diplomatic service in 1981 after leaving Oxford University, going on to work at the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office, where he ran HMGCC.\nIProov said: “Mr Alleyn’s role is to bring impartiality and business experience to the board. He is subject to the legal obligations that apply to directors of private companies, as prescribed by the Companies Act 2006. Mr Alleyn has no executive responsibilities and no influence over iProov’s data processing.”\nIProov won its contract to provide facial verification software to the NHS amid a drive to digitise the health service.\nWhile the contract hasn’t been published, documents on the government’s “digital marketplace” website show that it typically charges an annual service fee of up to £1.4m and a cost per user of £1.50.\nThe NHS said it had secured a discount.\nIProov also sells its software to businesses including Eurostar and several banks, as well as to foreign agencies including the US Department of Homeland Security. It does not sell data. It said all of its activities were regulated by GDPR and that UK law protects against it being compelled to release or hand over any user data.\nIts founder-boss Andrew Bud has spoken of his desire for facial recognition to be used in more settings in the UK, including on the door of venues such as nightclubs.\nCori Crider, director of Foxglove, a team of lawyers investigating the misuse of technology, said : “So long as this system to log into the NHS app is optional then it may be fine but officials definitely shouldn’t be ‘nudging’ patients to log in with their faces to access healthcare.\n“We should all also reflect on whether we’re heading towards a world where people have to use their faces just to walk into the supermarket or the pharmacy or the nightclub.”\nDr Stephanie Hare said: “Once this stuff is brought in, it’s very difficult to get rid of. It’s the thin end of the wedge and Covid is an opportunity for companies to get a foothold.”\nA spokesperson for NHS Digital said: “The NHS app is helping millions of people to quickly and easily access their NHS Covid Pass, and frees up time for GP surgeries by allowing people to book appointments and order repeat prescriptions online.\n“We use facial verification software when people decide to use the app to access their confidential patient data, as part of the high-level NHS login identity verification process which is clearly explained to app users.\n“This means people using the NHS app can trust that their data will be safe and secure.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The NHS app is collecting and storing facial verification data from citizens in England.\",\n\"The data collection is taking place under a contract with a company linked to Tory donors called iProov.\",\n\"Privacy campaigners express concerns about transparency and accountability in this process.\",\n\"There are questions about the security and secrecy surrounding the use of this data.\",\n\"The app is used to access medical records and obtain certificates related to vaccine status for overseas travel and events.\",\n\"The app asks some users for video facial verification by default, involving sending a video of their face to iProov.\",\n\"The app also collects additional personal information during the sign-up process.\",\n\"IProov and NHS Digital claim to anonymize and secure users' biometric data, but there are concerns about this.\",\n\"The contract with iProov and the data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for the NHS app have not been published for security reasons.\",\n\"Experts suggest that such information could be desirable to intelligence services.\",\n\"Privacy advocates and experts raise concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability in the use of facial verification and data flows in the NHS app.\",\n\"The involvement of a private company, iProov, in this process is questioned.\",\n\"There are links between iProov and Conservative donors.\",\n\"IProov's software is also sold to other businesses and foreign agencies.\",\n\"The founder of iProov, Andrew Bud, expresses a desire for wider use of facial recognition in the UK.\",\n\"Concerns are raised about the potential expansion of facial recognition technology's use beyond healthcare.\",\n\"The spokesperson for NHS Digital defends the use of facial verification software in the NHS app.\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2021\/sep\/15\/nhs-app-storing-facial-verification-data-via-contract-with-firm-linked-to-tory-donors","query_name":"updated_file_Mapping_App_Default_Privacy_Settings_Concerns.xlsx"}

Since 2015, Beijing has restricted foreign researchers from accessing gene data on Chinese people.\nIn August, a human genetics committee at the Polish Academy of Sciences said a \"lack of compliance\" by what it called \"Far East companies\" with the principles of genetic testing ethics raised serious doubts. It did not name any companies or countries but urged labs and scientific institutions that sequence genetic material abroad to stop using biotechnology companies there.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nIt said about 100,000 complete Polish genomes may already be in \"Far Eastern\" laboratories, citing a rough estimate which Reuters could not verify. Poland has no control over that sensitive personal data, the committee said.\nFiglerowicz said the Genomic Map, which is expected to cost over 100 million zlotys ($25.35 million) and is about halfway through its programme of sequencing 5,000 Polish genomes, has outsourced the work to a third party since 2019.\nThat company, Bialystok-based Central Europe Genomics Center sp. z o.o. (CEGC), started using BGI's technology last year, he said; now Figlerowicz said the Genomic Map of Poland had decided not to send any genetic data out of the country and is likely to cancel the contract it has with CEGC. He added that the final decision, still to be approved by the funding institutions, is expected within the next week or two.\nAs the technology to sequence genetic data has advanced and become cheaper, Figlerowicz said, the mapping project plans to bring the remaining sequencing in-house. The project wants to ensure Poland has genomic \"independence\" so it can ensure data security.\nCEGC did not respond to requests for comment. Poznan-based biotech company Inno-Gene S.A., which holds a minority stake in CEGC, said it did not know of a possible cancellation.\nThe European Union, which provided about 65% of the total funding for the Genomic Map, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did Poland's Ministry of Education and National Information Processing Institute, also involved with funding the project. Poland's special services declined to comment.\nNATIONAL SECURITY\nReuters reported in July that BGI had developed and improved a prenatal screening test sold in at least 52 countries in collaboration with People's Liberation Army hospitals.\nThe privacy policy on the test's website says data collected can be shared when it is \"directly relevant to national security or national defence security\" in China, although BGI says it hasn't been asked to do that. BGI uses the pregnant women's genetic data for research into the traits of populations. It also collaborates with the PLA in other areas of research.\nBGI rejects any suggestion that it developed the test, branded NIFTY, in collaboration with the military, and says working with military hospitals is not equivalent.\n\"BGI takes all aspects of data protection, privacy and ethics extremely seriously,\" the company said in a statement on the Polish decision, adding it complies with all applicable data protection laws and regulations.\n\"We value the business and research relationships we have with all our partners and customers in Poland and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with them.\"\n($1 = 3.9448 zlotys)\nAdditional reporting by Kirsty Needham in Sydney; Edited by Sara Ledwith\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAcquire Licensing Rights\n, opens new tab\nJoanna Plucinska\nThomson Reuters\nJoanna reports on airlines and travel in Europe, including tourism trends, sustainability and policy.

Some of the random pictures feature people in informal poses who can clearly be identified.\nCanada’s Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart wrote to Google in early August asking for more details. She said if the Street View product were expanded to Canada without being amended, it could well violate privacy laws.\nThe images were produced in partnership with Canadian firm Immersive Media Corp IMC.V, which says it has taken similar street level pictures of major Canadian cities.\nCanadian law obliges businesses wishing to disclose personal information about individuals to first obtain their consent. Stoddart said pictures of people on Street View were clear enough to be considered personal information.\n“The images ... appear to have been collected largely without the consent and knowledge of the individuals who appear in the images,” wrote Stoddart.\n“I am concerned that, if the Street View application were deployed in Canada, it might not comply with our federal privacy legislation. In particular, it does not appear to meet the basic requirements of (the law).”\nStoddart sent a similar letter to Immersive Media and the documents were posted on her Web site, www.privcom.gc.ca\/.\nA spokeswoman for Google said the company abides by the local laws of the countries it operates in.\n“This imagery is several months old and is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street,” she said by e-mail. She did not say whether Google planned to expand the service into Canada.\nStoddart said that although people could request their image be removed from Street View, this was not enough to meet Canada’s 2004 personal information protection act.\n“From our our point of view, if you spot yourself and you perceive that as a violation of your privacy rights, then the act has already been violated,” said Colin McKay, a spokesman for the privacy commissioner’s office.\nStoddart did not give either firm a deadline. If Google launched Street View in Canada without taking privacy laws into account, Stoddart could launch an official investigation, said McKay.\n“We thought we’d get out in advance of any implementation and ask them how they were going to take into account Canadian privacy rights,” he said.\nInvestigations usually end with the commissioner working with companies to issue findings and recommendations.\n“(Speaking) hypothetically, I don’t think we’d lean toward a cease and desist (order), we’d lean toward enforcing privacy rights.

Facial recognition has no redeeming qualities from a privacy and autonomy lens - it is also famously inaccurate and completely unreliable.”\nIndia’s Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling in 2017 on the national biometric identity card programme, said that individual privacy is a fundamental right, amid concerns over data breaches and the card’s mandated use for services.\nYet the ruling has done little to check the adoption of technologies such as facial recognition, which are “fundamentally contrary to our constitutional rights and principles of criminal justice”, said Marda.\nWorldwide, the rise of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies have popularised the use of facial recognition for a range of applications from tracking criminals to counting truant students.\nSingapore’s Changi Airport is considering using facial recognition systems to find late passengers and the country also plans to use the capabilities in a project to fit cameras and sensors on over 100,000 lampposts.\nBut critics say the technology has accuracy problems, particularly in identifying darker-skinned women and those from ethnic minorities.\nThey also warn that users are not being told how the technology works, where their data goes, and whether they can opt out.\nIn May, San Francisco officials banned the use of facial recognition technology by city personnel in a sign of the growing backlash.\nIndia’s home ministry recently called for a tender for facial recognition systems to modernise the police force and its information gathering and criminal identification processes.\nThe Bengaluru airport system, described as “your face is your boarding pass”, offers the “highest degree of safety and security while ensuring stringent standards of privacy,” a spokeswoman for the airport said.\nThe biometric data is used only for authentication and verification of passengers, and is deleted within a few hours of flight completion, she said.\nThe government’s digital travel policy states that passenger consent is needed for use of their biometric data for marketing purposes, and that users must have the option to opt out.\nBut passengers are likely to choose convenience if they see no tangible cost, said Marda.\n“The problem is that there is a huge cost,” she said.\n“By enrolling, you’re providing a private entity with a biometric map of your face in the absence of accountability and transparency mechanisms, and no data protection,” she said.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.

And if that information is accurate, their precise location can be revealed using a process called trilateration.\nHere's an example. Imagine a man shows up on a dating app as \"200m away\". You can draw a 200m (650ft) radius around your own location on a map and know he is somewhere on the edge of that circle.\nIf you then move down the road and the same man shows up as 350m away, and you move again and he is 100m away, you can then draw all of these circles on the map at the same time and where they intersect will reveal exactly where the man is.\nIn reality, you don't even have to leave the house to do this.\nResearchers from the cyber-security company Pen Test Partners created a tool that faked its location and did all the calculations automatically, in bulk.\nThey also found that Grindr, Recon and Romeo had not fully secured the application programming interface (API) powering their apps.\nThe researchers were able to generate maps of thousands of users at a time.\n\"We think it is absolutely unacceptable for app-makers to leak the precise location of their customers in this fashion. It leaves their users at risk from stalkers, exes, criminals and nation states,\" the researchers said in a blog post.\nLGBT rights charity Stonewall told BBC News: \"Protecting individual data and privacy is hugely important, especially for LGBT people worldwide who face discrimination, even persecution, if they are open about their identity.\"\nCan the problem be fixed?\nThere are several ways apps could hide their users' precise locations without compromising their core functionality.\nThese include:\nonly storing the first three decimal places of latitude and longitude data, which would let people find other users in their street or neighbourhood without revealing their exact location\noverlaying a grid across the world map and snapping each user to their nearest grid line, obscuring their exact location\nHow have the apps responded?\nThe security company told Grindr, Recon and Romeo about its findings.\nRecon told BBC News it had since made changes to its apps to obscure the precise location of its users.\nIt said: \"Historically we've found that our members appreciate having accurate information when looking for members nearby.\n\"In hindsight, we realise that the risk to our members' privacy associated with accurate distance calculations is too high and have therefore implemented the snap-to-grid method to protect the privacy of our members' location information.\"\nGrindr told BBC News users had the option to \"hide their distance information from their profiles\".\nIt added Grindr did obfuscate location data \"in countries where it is dangerous or illegal to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community\". However, it is still possible to trilaterate users' exact locations in the UK.\nRomeo told the BBC that it took security \"extremely seriously\".\nIts website incorrectly claims it is \"technically impossible\" to stop attackers trilaterating users' positions. However, the app does let users fix their location to a point on the map if they wish to hide their exact location. This is not enabled by default.\nThe company also said premium members could switch on a \"stealth mode\" to appear offline, and users in 82 countries that criminalise homosexuality were offered Plus membership for free.\nBBC News also contacted two other gay social apps, which offer location-based features but were not included in the security company's research.\nScruff told BBC News it used a location-scrambling algorithm. It is enabled by default in \"80 regions around the world where same-sex acts are criminalised\" and all other members can switch it on in the settings menu.\nHornet told BBC News it snapped its users to a grid rather than presenting their exact location. It also lets members hide their distance in the settings menu.\nAre there other technical issues?\nThere is another way to work out a target's location, even if they have chosen to hide their distance in the settings menu.\nMost of the popular gay dating apps show a grid of nearby men, with the closest appearing at the top left of the grid.\nIn 2016, researchers demonstrated it was possible to locate a target by surrounding him with several fake profiles and moving the fake profiles around the map.\n\"Each pair of fake users sandwiching the target reveals a narrow circular band in which the target can be located,\" Wired reported.\nThe only app to confirm it had taken steps to mitigate this attack was Hornet, which told BBC News it randomised the grid of nearby profiles.\n\"The risks are unthinkable,\" said Prof Angela Sasse, a cyber-security and privacy expert at UCL.\nLocation sharing should be \"always something the user enables voluntarily after being reminded what the risks are,\" she added.\nMore on this story\n10 years of Grindr: A rocky relationship\nPublished\n25 March 2019\nBeyond Today: Can Grindr be kinder?\nPublished\n28 March 2019","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The news is about problems related to location information leakage.\",\n\"Some of the most popular gay dating apps, including Grindr, Romeo, and Recon, have been exposing the exact location of their users.\",\n\"Cyber-security researchers were able to generate a map of users across London, revealing their precise locations using trilateration.\",\n\"Grindr, Recon, and Romeo had not fully secured the application programming interface (API) powering their apps, making it easier for location data to be accessed.\",\n\"The security company recommended methods for hiding users' precise locations, such as storing less precise latitude and longitude data or using grid-based location obfuscation.\",\n\"Recon made changes to obscure the precise location of its users after being informed of the issue.\",\n\"Grindr offered an option to hide distance information but admitted it was still possible to trilaterate users' exact locations in the UK.\",\n\"Romeo claimed to take security seriously but did not provide a technical solution to the problem, instead allowing users to manually fix their location on the map.\",\n\"Other gay dating apps like Scruff and Hornet mentioned using location-scrambling algorithms and grid-based user positioning to protect user privacy.\",\n\"There was also discussion of a potential issue where fake profiles could be used to narrow down a user's location, with Hornet being the only app mentioned to have taken steps to mitigate this attack.\"\n]\n}","From":"bbc.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-49265245","query_name":"updated_file_Mapping_App_Default_Privacy_Settings_Concerns.xlsx"}

{"num":88,"Time":null,"Title":"Why you should opt out of Amazon Sidewalk — and which devices it’s on","Content":"CNN\n — \nThis week, Amazon launched Sidewalk, a new wireless network that takes a portion of your home internet and allows other Amazon devices to jump on when they’re out of a home network.\nA majority of Amazon Device owners were automatically enrolled on June 8 — but you can still opt out.\nWhat exactly is Amazon Sidewalk?\nSidewalk is meant to keep your Amazon devices online (or, in some cases, devices that have partnered with the tech giant, like Tile) even if the main network they live on goes down. The main aim is to make smart gadgets easier to connect and eliminate downtime. Additionally, it plays into Amazon’s vision of shared connected communities, and Sidewalk is akin to the glue that holds it all together — allowing you to share bandwidth with your neighbors and vice versa. It could be a nearby Ring Floodlight Cam, an Echo speaker or even a Tile that needs to update its location. The latter example is aided by a location setting, which is disabled by default. With that on, the approximate location of your Sidewalk bridge is shared and can help with pinpointing devices on a map.\nAmazon has said the network was designed with privacy in mind (multiple encrypted layers for data to travel through) and has published a whitepaper detailing the steps it took to make these connections safe. “Sidewalk is designed with multiple layers of privacy and security to secure data traveling on the network and to keep customers safe and in control,” Amazon says in a statement to CNN Underscored. The multiple layers include encrypted lanes for data to move through and, in addition, they’re utilizing rotating device IDs to reduce info being tied back to specific users.\nEven so, experts we spoke with are noting concerns — Sidewalk is a new mesh network that uses similar properties to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Both of these have not proven to be invincible to malware or hackers. Amazon’s Sidewalk is proprietary, and encryption is on board, but until we’ve had the chance to test this new experience, we can’t speak to its security or performance, especially with Amazon devices, third parties and users all having a piece of the equation.\nYou’d also be sharing your home’s internet connection. It’s a very small amount, around 500MB of bandwidth a month (enough to stream an HD video or download an app), but it opens your network and lets other users use it. Essentially, Sidewalk is taking a piece of the internet from many users to create a network. They’re taking security precautions, but Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as a whole have been known to have security holes.\n“There are privacy provisions baked in, but many consumers may be concerned about their bandwidth being used by others,” says Avi Greengart, a tech analyst focusing on devices and adoptions. You can see Amazon’s explanation of the privacy and encryption laid out here; additionally, after Sidewalk is tested for a bit by users, analysts and reporters alike can get a better sense of the experience. Ring has noted in a public FAQ that the connection is encrypted for you and others you set as authorized users. None of this changes the fact that a portion of your internet bandwidth is being shared, though.\nThe remaining concern: It’s unknown how well the benefits will perform. In a statement to CNN Underscored, Amazon notes that “Sidewalk will provide value for every customer, such as more reliable connections, easier troubleshooting and extended range for their devices, such as smart lights, pet locators or smart locks.”\nGreengart calls out that it’s “a genuinely useful extension of your home network to outdoor lights and potentially other internet-connected devices on your property.” This may be the case, but as we stated above, we haven’t gone hands-on with the Sidewalk network or even devices that have the feature turned on yet.\nHow to opt-out of Sidewalk\nBecause of all the unknowns, for now we’d recommend opting out. (Note: If you should change your mind in the future, you can engage this feature back on.)\nWith both the Alexa app and the Ring app, you’ll find that the location setting is disabled by default. We currently recommend keeping that off, even if you keep Sidewalk on, to protect your location. With that engaged, the approximate location of your Sidewalk bridge will be used to help locate other devices like a Tile tracker. The location presented, with finding an item tracker like Tile, will be a highlighted area on a map, not traceable back to the Sidewalk bridge and not a precise spot.\nTo opt out on Amazon devices, open up the Alexa app on your Android or iOS device. Once open, click the “more” button in the bottom right, then “settings” > “account settings” and then select “Amazon Sidewalk.” From there, you’ll want to hit the blue tab icon next to enabled and see it switch to the off position. You’ll also see disabled next to it. Once done, you’re opted out of Sidewalk.\nFor those with Ring products, this will happen within the Ring app for Android or iOS: Hit the three-lined hamburger icon in the top left. Then tap “control center” and scroll to “Amazon Sidewalk” under the “community control” heading. Tap into it, and you’ll see a list of Ring devices you might have. Currently, Ring’s Floodlight Cam, Spotlight Cam Mount and Spotlight Cam Wired are the only devices to feature Sidewalk. If you don’t have them, you can’t disable the feature, as it’s not on your network. If you do, tap into each device and click the switch to disable them.\nWhich devices have Sidewalk inside?\nAmazon is being transparent and sharing all of the devices that Sidewalk is built into. These devices act as a bridge (aka a hub) to get other devices onto the Sidewalk network. Here’s a full list:\nEcho (3rd Gen and newer)\nEcho Dot (3rd Gen and newer)\nEcho Dot for Kids (3rd Gen and newer)\nEcho Dot With Clock (3rd Gen and newer)\nEcho Plus (all generations)\nEcho Show (2nd Gen and newer)\nEcho Spot\nEcho Studio\nEcho Input\nEcho Flex\nRing Floodlight Cam (2019)\nRing Spotlight Cam Wired (2019)\nRing Spotlight Cam Mount (2019)\nLet’s recap\nAmazon turned Sidewalk on by default, but because of potential issues around privacy concerns, and a lack of clarity around the benefit to users, we recommend taking the steps outlined above to opt out, at least for now. Choosing to opt out doesn’t negatively impact your experience with an Echo or a Ring device and protects you from any possible vulnerability. Amazon notes that they “recognize customers appreciate choice and control, which is why they can enable or disable their Amazon Sidewalk settings at any time.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems related to privacy and location information leakage.

Google said it discovered the problem after German regulators launched an inquiry.\nAt the time, Australian communications minister Stephen Conroy dubbed it the \"single greatest breach in the history of privacy\".\nAustralia's privacy commissioner, Karen Curtis, said her investigation was complete and she had determined that Google breached the nation's Privacy Act.\n\"Collecting personal information in these circumstances is a very serious matter,\" Curtis said. \"Australians should reasonably expect that private communications remain private.\"\nIn almost all cases, the privacy commissioner is barred from imposing punishments, though he or she can occasionally order a party to pay compensation for a violation depending on an investigation's findings. In the Google investigation, Curtis said the act prevented her from imposing any punishment as she had initiated the investigation.\nInstead, she said the company has promised to conduct a privacy impact assessment on any new Street View projects involving personal information and regularly consult with her about personal data collection activities in Australia.\nCurtis said Google had also agreed to publish an apology to Australians on its official blog which it did.\n\"We want to reiterate to Australians that this was a mistake for which we are sincerely sorry,\" wrote Alan Eustace, Google's top engineering executive. \"Maintaining people's trust is crucial to everything we do and we have to earn that trust every single day.

Many expected the case to cost Google (GOOGL) billions of dollars because plaintiffs alleged the data collection broke federal wiretapping laws -— but the agreement doesn’t include financial relief for class members.\nStreet View is a feature that lets users interact with panoramic images of locations around the world that launched in 2007.

But as our organisation has grown, we realised other areas of the company could benefit from being able to overlay different types of information about a location on an interactive map.\nMapping housing data through geographical information systems (GIS) helps to spot trends or answer specific questions about our work. It is easier to understand data in this way, compared with reading it on complex spreadsheets or even in written reports.\nMost of the data involved in running a housing association, from financial assets and information about our tenants to development plans and rent arrears, has a geographic element so it makes sense to be able to map it using GIS. Having a geographical view of what was happening on our estates could help us to make better decisions across the organisation.\nThe stumbling block was finding a GIS system that could display all the information held in our existing databases across housing, asset management, repairs, development, customer service and grounds maintenance. We met with staff to explain the benefits of using this type of technology, and asked them what they wanted to achieve by using it. It gave us a detailed picture of exactly what our staff needed to do with their data, and helped us find a provider who could supply software which suited our particular work.\nToday, GIS technology by Esri is helping to identify new development sites to build homes which could have previously gone undetected. Staff can now look at property types, access, current land use and ownership on the same map and spot areas for closer inspection. So far, this has led to secured planning on three new sites which will produce 16 homes.

They can see all the relevant information in the GIS and don't need to pass callers between different departments, or ask questions of four or five staff before they find an answer to a tenant's question.\nThe software is also enabling us to create energy-efficient homes for residents.

{"num":4,"Time":"Fri 30 Sep 2016 08.30 CEST","Title":"Has a software bug really called decades of brain imaging research into question?","Content":"Since its inception in 1990, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has revolutionised the way we think about the brain. In association with other techniques, it provides invaluable clues to understand brain disorders, like psychosis or dementia. At its heart, fMRI is a medical imaging technique that allows scientists to look at where oxygenated blood is being directed around the brain – if a brain area is being used for a particular task, it will need more oxygen. So by extension, fMRI allows us to look at how information is processed in the brain, and is one of the few techniques we have to look directly into a person’s brain while they are thinking.\nHowever, this past summer has seen a series of alarmist headlines about the technique cropping up in the media. There have been claims that ‘Tens of Thousands of fmri brain studies may be flawed’, and that a ‘bug in fMRI software calls 15 years of research into question’ (also here, and up to 20 years here), and even that fMRI as no scientific value (‘the great brain scan scandal’) or that much of what we know about the brain may be wrong. But is fMRI research really in such a sorry state?\nThe furor finds its origins in a study in the July issue of the Proceeding of the National Academy of Science by Anders Eklund, Thomas Nichols and Hans Knutsson. Despite being in use for some 25 years, some of the most common statistical analyses used on fMRI data haven’t been fully assessed for accuracy. To address this, Eklund and his team set out to measure the false positive rates of standard task fMRI methods. A false positive is when we wrongly conclude an effect is present, when in reality there is no effect. A pregnancy test that comes out positive when the woman is not pregnant is one example of this type of error. When it comes to fMRI data, a false positive could be that an area of the brain is declared activated by a task, when in reality it is not. Eklund’s work is essential because it allows us to ascertain the scientific validity of fMRI – in other words, how much we can be sure that we’re measured what we think we’re measuring.\nOnce signals from the MRI machine are recorded, many analysis steps take place and ‘maps’ of activation can be created, showing which areas of the brain are in use, and which are not. Given the complexity of the method, it is impossible to completely eliminate false positives from these maps, so researchers use statistical tests that try to control errors to a desired (usual small) rate. The key finding from the PNAS paper is that, one method typically used in fMRI analysis can give a much higher false positive rate than expected – in some cases, a chance of up to 70% that the software might produce a false positive when 5% was expected.\nPsychology research: hopeless case or pioneering field?\nRead more\nThis might sound disastrous, but it’s not actually completely new. As Neuroskeptic has pointed out, this study is the culmination of work that has been going on for a number of years, with the novel contribution here being that Eklund’s team illustrated the problem empirically, based on openly available data, identified the origin of the problems, and provided an alternative solution to standard methods.\nSo what can we really conclude from the study? First, it is not true that tens of thousands of studies are affected. Not all fMRI studies use the methods called into question. As pointed out on one of the author’s blog, around 3500 studies (or less than 10% of existing fMRI studies) used the method called into question. It is equally important to note that this also does not mean the discoveries from all 3500 of these studies are false; the effects in some studies could be so strong to be detected even despite this problem, or the findings in others could be weak but have subsequently been replicated. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing the status of each of these studies, as data from published studies was not shared or archived for reanalysis.\nAnother headline claim was that 15 years of research are called into question because of a bug. The bug reported in the paper concerns an error in one piece of software (AFNI, the least used of the three tested) leading to higher error rates than expected (this bug was fixed in 2015). As the authors note, this bug contributed to inflated false positive rates, but is only a small factor relative to the problems common to all three software packages.\nIn short, for those who see these problems as the death knell for fMRI, they are simply missing the point of this line of work - which is to make the science more robust. When controversial issues like these have arisen in the past, far from throwing the baby out with the bath water, the scientific community has instead responded strongly and raised standards. There is no doubt this is going to be the same this time around.\nFind out more:\nEklund et al. (2016). Cluster-failure: why fMRI inferences for spatial extent have inflated false-positive rate.

{"num":1,"Time":"MAY 27, 2022","Title":"Fact Check-Does ‘2000 Mules’ provide evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election?","Content":"By Reuters Fact Check\n16 MIN READ\nA documentary directed by conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza claims it can prove widespread fraud was carried out during the 2020 presidential election in the United States. Reuters Fact Check examined the main claims presented in the film and did not find any concrete evidence definitively showing proof of fraud.\nThe 90-minute film \"2000 Mules\" sees D’Souza team up with True the Vote, a Texas-based nonprofit that describes itself as protecting election integrity (www.truethevote.org\/about\/), to investigate alleged voter fraud in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nAll five of the listed states were swing states in 2020 that ultimately backed Joe Biden for president - and were later central to baseless speculations of fraud.\nReuters has covered this topic extensively (here) and (here), as well as in fact checks (here), (here) and (here).\nD’Souza’s documentary says Biden victories in swing states could be thanks to 2,000 people – or “mules” – who were hired by unnamed nonprofits - dubbed “stash houses” - to conduct “ballot trafficking”, i.e.: stuffing numerous drop boxes with potentially fake absentee ballots.\nIt also alleges that the so-called “mules” were paid $10 for every fake ballot they submitted.\nD’Souza did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Reuters.\nTHE METHODOLOGY\nD’Souza and True the Vote analyzed surveillance footage of drop boxes mostly from Georgia, as well as “some” from Arizona, along with “geotracking” data purchased from unnamed brokers.\nThe “geotracking” data was gleaned from cellphone apps pinpointing device location and movements between Oct. 1, 2020, and election day, Nov. 3, for Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the documentary. Data for Georgia stretched until January, when there was a runoff vote.\nThe documentary alleges that by tracking phone locations to the addresses of five alleged “stash house” nonprofits and 10 or more drop boxes, the “mules” were identified.\nThere were 242 people in Atlanta, Georgia, who fitted the bill; 200+ in Arizona; 100 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; 500+ in Michigan, and 1,000+ mules in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – totaling over 2,000 “mules”.\nViewers were then shown multiple surveillance footage clips of different people at drop boxes, which the documentary said it had identified as some of the ballot traffickers carrying out their crimes.\nGEOTRACKING\nMultiple concerns were raised by experts speaking to Reuters about the “geotracking” portion of the documentary. It was unclear whether the same test was applied anywhere other than the swing states in question (to prove a unique phenomenon had happened), along with data validity, accuracy, and discussion about other possibilities that could explain the findings.\n“The entirety of the claim rests on cell phone location data, which doesn’t remotely show that people were actually using the drop boxes (it doesn’t have the granularity to show that, as opposed to just walking or even driving by),” said Kenneth R Mayer, Professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who spoke to Reuters via email.\nAccording to True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, who spoke in the documentary, the dataset had been validated because it was used by the organization to solve two murder cases that were “ebbing on cold case status”.\nOnly one murder case was detailed as an example in the documentary – that of eight-year-old Secoriea Turner on July 4, 2020, in Atlanta – and which authorities told NPR was solved without anything to do with Engelbrecht (here).\nD’Souza, meanwhile, claimed without offering evidence that the dataset had the “reliability of a fingerprint”, expanding in a later podcast interview that it was accurate to between “12 and 18 inches” (here).\nExperts speaking to Reuters disagreed.\n“I have never heard that geotracking using cell phones could have errors as low as 12-18 inches,” said Chen Qian, Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, Santa Cruz. “This range is way below the ranges reported by scientists and engineers.\n“A research paper written by AT&T and Purdue University researchers in 2020 predicted that the average location error of 5G networks would vary from 2 meters to >10 meters,” said Qian. “Note their results are simulated results in ideal settings, used for predictions. They are not real experiments, because 5G has not been available everywhere. In real environments the errors would be larger.” (here)\nMoreover, drop boxes tend to be in high-traffic areas such as public libraries, shopping malls, municipal buildings, or schools. For example, a map of drop boxes in the five metro Atlanta counties of Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, Gwinnett and Clayton shows that all are clustered in busy locations likely to have high cell phone activity (here).\n“My local drop box is in my public library, a location I pass probably 20 or 30 times a week,” said Paul Gronke, Director of the Elections and Voting Information Center at Reed College in Oregon (evic.reed.edu\/). “Did I deposit 20 ballots or is my drop box on a heavily trafficked street? You tell me.”\nTrue the Vote said in the documentary it had ruled out people where it believed their “pattern of life” outside the election period involved travelling to nonprofits and drop box locations. They did not offer information on how they did this or who these people were.\nHowever, Barry C Burden, Director of the Elections Research Centre at the University of Wisconsin- Madison (elections.wisc.edu\/), told Reuters via email that there were still acceptable reasons for observed heightened activity during election periods.\nHe said: “Some of the individuals tracked might even have been election workers checking on or emptying the drop boxes, so it would be a sign of vigilance by election officials rather than nefarious behavior.”\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO\nTo corroborate the geotracking dataset, True the Vote said it had compared it with surveillance video covering locations of some of the drop boxes.\nThey claimed to have access to 4 million minutes of footage, which was mostly from Georgia. The documentary makers said some of the surveillance cameras were turned off in Arizona and that there was no footage from Wisconsin. No information was provided about surveillance footage from Michigan or Pennsylvania.\nReuters was unable to examine these alleged minutes of footage, but the videoclips presented in the documentary alone do not provide proof of fraud.\nWhen Reuters asked Engelbrecht via email how “mules” identified via geotracking data were then matched to surveillance footage, she responded: “Matches are made by comparing the location and time stamp of the video to the location and the time stamp of the individual device.”\nThe documentary shows several surveillance clips said to reveal “mules” stuffing fake ballots in the drop boxes.\nIn one clip, a couple of ballots appear to drop to the floor as one man goes to post; the documentary makers suggest this is suspicious, as well as the man allegedly posting the ballots late at night.\nIn another, a woman wearing a face mask and gloves is seen posting a ballot before turning to place her gloves in a nearby bin. It is claimed in the documentary that she is a “mule” because she was wearing gloves (to hide her fingerprints) and did not look at the bin, so must have had prior knowledge of it being there. The documentary makers did not appear to consider the possibility that the woman was wearing gloves, along with her face mask, as a personal protective measure against COVID-19.\nThe unidentified woman was also said to have visited “dozens and dozens” of drop boxes; however, no other clips of her, nor any further evidence, were shown.\nTwo other clips show men in separate locations taking photos of themselves posting their ballot, which the documentary makers allege was to provide evidence of the job done so the “mules” can get paid.\nIn a Fox News interview, Engelbrecht claimed the average number of visits by a \"mule\" to a drop box was 38 (here). Yet none of the surveillance videos showed the same person more than once.\nBALLOT HARVESTING VS FRAUDULENT BALLOTS\nSome of the people in Georgia who were presented in surveillance footage as so-called “mules” were seen posting more than one ballot at once, which the documentary makers suggested was proof of voter fraud.\nBut this doesn’t necessarily constitute fraud. Ballot harvesting, the posting of completed ballots on behalf of a third party, is legal in several states, including Georgia (n-thhere).\n“Some of the so-called “mules” might have been legitimate family members putting in ballots in Georgia,” said Theodore Allen, Associate Professor at Ohio State University, specializing in the administering of elections.\n“Many people need encouragement to vote and offering to collect and bring to ballot boxes is, in many states, a legal and legitimate way to increase voter participation which is often low.”\nReuters also spoke to M.V. (Trey) Hood III, Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Georgia, to understand the legality around dropping off multiple ballots. He said that issues of ballot harvesting and fraud have been conflated, and there are protections in place in Georgia to prevent the posting of fraudulent ballots.\n“[In Georgia] In 2020 we were using signature verification to verify absentee ballots, so there were safety mechanisms in place to ensure it wasn’t a fraudulent ballot.”\nHe added: “I haven’t seen any hard evidence being offered up that these ballots were fraudulent.”\nReuters looked into a video posted in May claiming to show one such “mule”. Pennsylvania county authorities debunked the “evidence” by confirming it showed a designated agent dropping ballots off on behalf of individuals who are unable to (here).\nUltimately, ‘2000 Mules’ speculates that the so-called ballot-traffickers were dropping off fraudulent ballots – but the film does not prove this. The ‘faked’ ballots were never opened and inspected, nor were the suspected “mules” on surveillance questioned, aside from one anonymous “informant” who says she never saw inside the supposed fraudulent ballots.\nCOULD BALLOTS BE FORGED?\nThe documentary claims its investigation reveals the potential existence of 380,000 overall fraudulent ballots. And, it claims, if all of these contained falsified votes for Joe Biden, the revelation is significant enough to have blocked a win by Donald Trump.\nListing all of the steps needed to falsify a ballot, Gronke told Reuters: “1) You need a falsified ballot with a unique bar code, printed on special paper, and a special envelope. If the claim is that you’ve somehow obtained 400,000 original ballots without the elections officials or voters knowing, how precisely did you do this?\n“2) You need to successfully forge the voter’s signature. 3) You need to deposit the envelope and have it validated by a local official.\n“Congratulations! Besides committing a felony, you have now cast ONE fraudulent ballot. Now you need to figure out how to do that hundreds of thousands of times, in different jurisdictions, with different ballot styles and different voting materials.”\nGronke’s sentiments were echoed by Christopher B. Mann, Associate Professor of Political Science at Skidmore College, who told Reuters: “If there are 400,000 people who had their ballot collected and returned for nefarious reasons, there should be significant numbers of people willing to tell their story. It is hard for two people to keep a secret. Asserting that 400,000 people are keeping a secret is beyond credibility.”\nReuters has previously explored the safeguards in place that make forging ballots on behalf of others difficult (here), (here).\n2020 ELECTION FOUND SAFE AND SECURE\nFalse claims pedaled by former U.S. President Donald Trump and his followers blaming widespread voting fraud for the 2020 election results have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of his own former administration (here).\nU.S. election security officials have said the election was “the most secure in American history” (here), (here).\nFormer U.S. Attorney General William Barr, the nation's top law enforcement official under Trump, said on Dec. 1, 2020, that he had not seen any evidence of fraud that would have changed the election results (here).\nFurthermore, more than 50 lawsuits brought by Trump or his allies alleging election fraud or other irregularities were dismissed by state and federal judges (here).\nVERDICT\nThe documentary “2000 Mules” does not provide any concrete, verifiable evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Technology and election integrity experts consulted by Reuters also did not find the geolocation, surveillance or any other information presented showed plausible evidence of fraud.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

But the GEBCO initiative is confident the data deficit can be closed this decade with a concerted global effort.\n\"It doesn't matter whether you operate a high-tech fleet of ships or you're just a simple boat-owner - every piece of data matters in this giant jigsaw we're making,\" said project director, Jamie McMichael-Phillips.\n\"If you're going to sea for whatever reason, switch on your echosounder. Even if you're just a yachtsman, a recreational sailor - then low-tech data-logging equipment is only a few hundred dollars, with the price coming down all the time. Fit it, plug in your GPS, plug in your echosounder and help us get to 100% coverage by 2030,\" he told BBC News.\nImage caption,\nAn elevated section of seafloor in front of a Greenland glacier helps protect it from incursions of warm ocean water that would otherwise melt the ice\nWhen Seabed 2030 was launched in 2017, only 6% of the oceans had been mapped to modern standards. So, it is possible to make swift and meaningful gains.\nFor example, a big jump in coverage would be achieved if all governments, companies, and research institutions released their embargoed data. There's no estimate for how much bathymetry (depth data) is hidden away on private web servers, but the volume may be very considerable indeed.\nThose organisations holding such information are being urged to think of the global good and to hand over, at the very least, de-resolved versions of their proprietary maps.\nSeabed 2030 is not seeking 5m resolution of the entire floor (close to something we already have of the Moon's surface). One depth sounding in a 100m grid square down to 1,500m will suffice; even less in much deeper waters.\nThe UK's new polar ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, is equipped to map millions of square km of ocean bottom over its career. The above image shows the ship's hull in dry dock. The yellow rectangle in the centre is a cover made of a synthetic material over the 8m-long array of transmit transducers for the deep-water multibeam echosounding system. The receive array is at right angles to this, just behind the people in the photo, but difficult to see because it is covered by a material that has much less contrast with the rest of the hull. Transducers for several other systems are also visible. The yellow square next to the individuals' heads is the transmit transducer for the acoustic sub-bottom profiling system, which provides a profile showing the layers in the upper few metres of sediment.\nThe past 12 months have been hampered by the limitations Covid has placed on research cruises. This is unfortunate because it's the science expeditions that will often visit those parts of the oceans where few other ships venture - into the Southern Ocean, for example.\nThat said, there've been some notable contributions of late from the research sector.\nOne of the most significant has come from the DSSV Pressure Drop, a ship funded by the Texan billionaire and adventurer Victor Vescovo.\nHis expeditions to the very deepest parts of Earth's oceans mapped an area equivalent to the size of France in just 10 months (an area the size of Finland within this had never been seen before).\nBetter seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons.\nThey are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines.\nThey are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.\nIn addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a pivotal role in moving heat around the planet.\nMedia caption,\nFugro is operating 12m-long USVs as part of its Blue Essence fleet\nIf Seabed 2030 is to meet the end-of-decade target, it will have to leverage the emergence of robotic ships and boats.\nUncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) are becoming increasingly popular.\nFugro, one of the world's leading marine geophysical survey companies, is building a fleet of USVs based on the Ocean X-Prize-winning SeaKit roboboat.\nFugro has two such boats surveying and inspecting oil-and-gas, wind farm, and power installations - in European waters and off Western Australia.

Akhand Bharat,” tweeted Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi alongside a photograph of the map. “Akhand Bharat in (the) New Parliament. It represents our powerful and self reliant India,” tweeted BJP lawmaker Manoj Kotak.\nThe mural inside India's new Parliament building.\nTo India’s neighbors, “Akhand Bharat” is an incendiary, neo-imperialist concept – one that has long been associated with the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), an ideological organization that heavily influences the BJP, and which believes in “Hindutva,” the idea that India should become the “Home of the Hindus.”\nEarlier this month, Pakistan said it was “appalled by the statements” made about the mural.\n“The gratuitous assertion of ‘Akhand Bharat’ is a manifestation of a revisionist and expansionist mindset that seeks to subjugate the identity and culture of not only India’s neighboring countries but also its own religious minorities,” said foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch.\nNepali politicians also chimed in.\n“If a country like India – that sees itself as an ancient and strong country, and as a model of democracy – puts Nepali territories in its map and hangs the map in parliament, it cannot be called fair,” opposition leader KP Sharma Oli said, according to The Kathmandu Post.\nIndia's Hindu extremists are calling for genocide against Muslims. Why is little being done to stop them?\nNepal’s former prime minister, Baburam Bhattarai, warned the map may stoke an “unnecessary and harmful diplomatic row.”\nAnd last week, Bangladesh asked New Delhi to clarify the situation. “Anger is being expressed from various quarters over the map,” said Shahriar Alam, its junior minister for foreign affairs.\nAnswering a question about the backlash last week, India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the issue had already been clarified by India, and it was “not political.”\nWhile India has dismissed their concerns, analysts say calls by BJP politicians to embrace “Akhand Bharat” are dangerous.\nThey say such appeals embolden extremist groups and are bad news for a constitutionally secular democracy, where about 80% of the 1.4 billion population is Hindu and 14% Muslim.\n“Many BJP leaders are increasingly making statements to placate the most hardcore elements of their party, without realizing how that might play out overseas,” said Salil Tripathi, a writer based in New York.\n“These politicians and leaders act as if the world isn’t listening. It keeps the cauldron hot, but it is a dangerous game.”\nControversial ceremony\nThe mural was not the only thing turning heads when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the parliament on May 28.\nSimilarly controversial was the ceremony itself, steeped in Hindu religious symbolism, which critics felt jarred with the supposedly secular nature of Indian government affairs. It also took place on the birthday of the late Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the man widely considered to have developed the Hindutva ideology and one of the first proponents of Akhand Bharat.\nA leader of the right-wing Hindu Mahasabha group, Savarkar is revered by Modi and the BJP, who credit him with leading India to its freedom from British colonial rule.\nIndian home minister Amit Shah pictured alongside a garlanded photo of Savarkar on April 21, 2017 in Mumbai, India.\nBut critics say it is wrong to honor his birthday, given his stance toward Muslims.\nThe Hindu Mahasabha’s website says if it takes power, it will not hesitate to “force” the migration of India’s Muslims to Pakistan.\nWhile the group’s ideas are decades old, it appears more bold about them now.\nIn December 2021, some extremists from the group called for a genocide against Muslims to “protect” India.\nSushant Singh, a senior fellow with the Centre for Policy Research think tank, said groups felt emboldened to make such brazen calls for violence because they “believe that they have the backing of the state.”\n“That is because the state clearly believes in their ideology and articulates that ideology,” he added.\nNervous neighbors\nWhile the BJP does not openly describe itself as Hindu nationalist, critics say such leanings are given away by legislation that favors Hindus and the rhetoric of some of its leading figures.\nOne of the BJP’s most controversial moves came in 2019 when it revoked the semi-autonomous status of the Muslim-majority region of Indian-administered Kashmir, bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi.\nMuslim women hold placards during a demonstration after educational institutes in Karnataka denied entry to students for wearing hijabs, in Bangalore on February 7, 2022.\nIndia said the move was aimed at ending separatism and terrorism it alleged was aided by Pakistan. Critics said the move was aimed at encouraging Hindus to settle there.\nSkepticism over New Delhi’s motives was fueled by India’s Home Minister Amit Shah when he said the revocation had partially achieved the dream of Akhand Bharat – a sentiment echoed by other right-wing politicians.\n“We have to see the dream of Akhand Bharat in this lifetime and it has started with (this),” said deputy chief minister of the state of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis.\nKashmiri boys hold a banner during a protest against the revoke of controversial Article 370 by Indian government in Srinagar while curfew continues on the fifth day in Kashmir, India on August 09, 2019.\nExperts say such rhetoric has made India’s neighbors nervous.\n“The tragedy is that with this kind of narrative coming from India, it only enforces the Pakistan army’s view that there is a threat,” said Pakistani historian Ayesha Jalal.\nFahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University, warned statements like these can “impact the national security calculus” of neighboring states.\nHe added: “In practical terms, the worry is (these comments) build on a brand of Hindu nationalism which has clear expansionist tendencies.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to map resolution issues as it discusses a mural inside India's new Parliament building that depicts a map of an ancient Indian civilization encompassing what is today Pakistan in the north and Bangladesh and Nepal in the east.

As governments shift to high-tech tools to map and record land rights, the digital divide has the potential to further marginalize rural communities and individuals,” she said.\nShe said that people must be informed of their land rights and be empowered to ensure that they are respected.\n“This is especially important for groups and individuals who are likely to be excluded - among them women and youth,” Roberts said.\nIn Indonesia, rights groups say millions of people have been denied legal titles, because they live in conflict areas that fall outside the government’s mapping exercise, which it says applies only to places where land title is “clean and clear”.\nHowever, non-state groups have also seized on technology to provide legal titles.\nIn Myanmar’s Kayin state, a decades-long fight for autonomy killed hundreds and forced tens of thousands of people from their homes.\nThe war officially ended in 2012 when the Karen National Union (KNU) and the military signed a ceasefire, but rights groups say threats to land tenure security have increased since then.\nRising investor interest in logging and mining, and the government’s move to set aside protected areas, raise the risk of land expropriation, said Saw Alex Htoo at the Karen Environmental and Social Action Network (KESAN), a rights group.\nKESAN has been mapping land, including community forests and areas held under customary law, using GPS and GIS technology, and verifying the results with villagers, he said.\nIt can take six months to a year to approve an application, and KNU then issues a title, he said.\n“Only with the involvement of the community can you decide issues such as how to establish ownership when the owners are not there.

Photograph: Amunts, et al. (2013).\nMapping the brain is all the rage. In 2009, the National Institutes of Health announced the Human Connectome Project, an ambitious multimillion-dollar initiative to produce a detailed map of the long-range connections in the human brain. Two years later, the Allen Institute for Brain Science launched the Allen Brain Atlas, a collection of online public resources that integrate information about gene activity with neuroanatomical data. And earlier this year, President Obama announced the Brain Activity Map project, which aims to \"reconstruct the full record of neural activity across complete neural circuits.\nNow an international team of researchers led by Katrin Amunts of the Jülich Research Center in Germany has created the most detailed map yet of the human brain. While existing brain atlases have a resolution of about 1 millimeter, the BigBrain map – which is described today in the journal Science – is about 50 times more detailed: with a resolution of 20 micrometers (or thousandths of a millimetre), it's almost detailed enough to see individual cells.\n\nTo create the BigBrain map, Amunts and her colleagues took advantage of recent advances in computing and image analysis. First, they took the brain of a 65-year-old woman who had recently died, and embedded the intact organ in paraffin wax. Next, they used a machine called a microtome to cut the brain into 7,400 ultra-thin slices, each just 20 micrometers thick. All of the slices were then treated with antibodies that stain the cell bodies of the neurons, and then digitized to give a series of images, each 13,000 x 11,000 pixels in size. Finally, all the images were digitally reconstructed to give a three-dimensional virtual model of the brain.\nThe whole procedure took approximately 1,000 hours altogether, and produced 1 Terabyte of data, which the researchers have made publicly available for others to use. They say the data set \"represents a new reference brain,\" which will allow for measurements of the thickness of the cerebral cortex, the density of cells in various regions of the brain, and other anatomical parameters, in unprecedented detail.\nHow useful could the BigBrain map be? According to the press release: \"Your brain's microscopic nooks and crannies are now on display in 3-D, offering scientists an invaluable tool in the quest to better elucidate brain form and function.\" Therein lies the problem. It's not your brain that is on display – it's that of the 65-year-old woman, and her brain is quite different from yours or mine. Your brain was shaped by a combination of nature and nurture – the genes you inherited, interacting with the environment in which you were raised. And your environment continues to shape your brain – every experience you have leaves its mark on your brain, by subtly changing the connections between its cells.\nIt's safe to say that no two brains are alike, and that there is no such thing as a \"typical\" brain. And these differences between the brains of individuals severely limit the utility of this map as a reference brain. The authors acknowledge this, and are now mapping more brains in the same way, so that they can add more information to the new data set.\nReference: Amunts, K., et al. (2013).

What is going on?\nWhat's the issue?\nShetland is more than 100 miles away from the Scottish mainland, as the crow flies. It takes 12 hours to get there from the mainland on a ferry. It is, by any measure, quite far away.\nBut looking at a lot of maps, that might not be immediately clear. Often as not, Shetland might show up enclosed in a box in the Moray Firth or in the North Sea off Aberdeenshire.\nThis isn't a new thing. The National Library of Scotland's map collection includes various examples dating back to the middle of the 17th Century where Shetland - and indeed Orkney - are corralled into boxes.\nExamples abound, from bank notes to the covers of government reports. But one representative of the islands fears that such maps are not properly representative of the islands.\nWhat harm does the box do?\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nCLYDESDALE BANK\nImage caption,\nShetland even appears in a box on some banknotes\nTavish Scott, the Lib Dem MSP for Shetland, says that putting the islands in a box causes people to forget about the challenges they face on account of their remote location.\nHe said: \"The logistics of getting to and from Shetland are all too often forgotten, and this has had an impact on the crucial economies of the islands, for instance the movement of oil, gas and seafood.\n\"Recognising where Shetland is located would go a long way to understanding the challenges we face as an island.\"\nThis isn't just an issue for Shetland, either. Despite being closer to the mainland, Orkney has been affected too, according to MSP Liam McArthur, a Lib Dem colleague of Mr Scott.\nHe said using boxes is not a superficial issue, but one which \"gives rise to a misconception about our islands\" - namely that they are \"a good deal closer to the mainland than is actually the case\".\nWhy does this happen?\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGOOGLE\nImage caption,\nProper context - the red bordered landmass is Shetland in its rightful position with Norway to the east and Iceland to the north west\nCartographers argue that because maps are drawn to scale, at a certain point they are left with a choice between having Shetland in a box or not on the map at all.\nMapping agency Ordnance Survey says that using inset boxes avoids \"publishing maps which are mostly sea\".\nA spokesman for the company said: \"The Shetland Islands are approximately 245km (152 miles) from the Scottish mainland, from the most northerly part of the Shetland Islands to John O' Groats, and 690km (428 miles) from the most southerly point of the Scottish and English border.\n\"It would be virtually impossible to print a paper map, with any usable detail, of this vast geography.\"\nMapmakers also point out that Shetland is far from alone in this regard. Elsewhere in the UK, the Isles of Scilly off Cornwall are routinely boxed, while two of the United States of America - Alaska and Hawaii - often get the same treatment.\nWhat's to be done?\nImage caption,\nTavish Scott initially raised the issue with the rural economy committee\nMr Scott has been campaigning for a \"Shetland mapping requirement\" to be put down in law.\nThis would require public authorities to display the islands \"in a manner that accurately and proportionately represents their geographical location in relation to the rest of Scotland\" whenever they publish a map of the country.\nBasically, it would bar public bodies from putting Shetland in a box - or publish their reasons for why they feel they have to.\nWhat do other people think?\nIslanders themselves are quite squarely behind Mr Scott's complaint - asked by the BBC, local residents described map boxes as \"really annoying\", \"silly\" and \"ridiculous\", saying that \"we should be where we belong\".\nA Facebook group campaigning to \"get Shetland on the map\" has gathered more than 1,600 followers. This might not sound like a huge number, but it would represent more than 7% of the islands' population.\nThe group collects examples of maps which place Shetland in weird and wonderful locations - including, faintly embarrassingly for Mr Scott, some Liberal Democrat campaign material which transported the islands to a spot off Fraserburgh.\nSkip facebook video by BBC The Social\nAllow Facebook content?\nThis article contains content provided by Facebook.

It is time to correct that,\" he said.\nParliament has adjourned until Thursday when the debate will continue.\nIn Mr Lipholo's vision, Lesotho would grow from 30,000 sq km (11,600 sq miles) to around 240,000 sq km (93,000 sq miles).\nHe said that while this was an issue dating back many decades, he believed it was important to address in the present day because the land would help bring prosperity to the people of Lesotho.\nHe is the leader of the Basotho Convention Movement, which campaigned on the issue during last year's election, gaining a single seat, which he holds.\nThe landlocked kingdom of Lesotho is largely mountainous with limited agricultural space.\nThe former British protectorate is heavily dependent on the country which completely surrounds it - South Africa.\nOver the decades thousands of workers have been forced by the lack of job opportunities at home to find work in South African mines.\nThe Lesotho government is yet to comment on the issue but it is unlikely to risk antagonising its much larger neighbour by backing it.\nMr Lipholo's motion is based on a 1962 United Nations resolution that recognised the right to self-determination and independence for the people of Basutoland - as Lesotho was then called.\nThe view from South African officials is that the motion to reclaim territories some Basotho view as their own does not stand a chance of happening, because it does not enjoy the support of the majority in Lesotho.\nOne of the key stumbling blocks is the 1964 Cairo Declaration of the Organisation of African Unity, now the African Union, whereby African leaders agreed to recognise the existing borders of their newly independent countries, even if they were drawn up by colonial powers, to avoid stirring up conflict across the continent.\nMr Lipholo has previously told Lesotho media that he also hopes to have the motion discussed in the British Parliament \"since it was the UK that gave Lesotho its independence in 1966, without correcting the borders seized by the Afrikaners\".\nThis is not the first time that Lesotho's present-day borders have been a topic of discussion. In 2018 a civil group known as the Free Basotho Movement wrote to the Lesotho's UK embassy to request that the late Queen Elizabeth remove the current frontier - essentially making Lesotho a 10th province of South Africa.\nThey said this would ensure free movement of Basotho people in South Africa and the perks South African nationals enjoy.

This, the organisation argued, made the tech giant complicit in Israeli policies of annexation and settlement of the occupied territories. Google responded that they had never labelled Palestine in the first place, while blaming a technical bug for removing the labels for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. While many commentators pointed out the inflated nature of the claim, fewer have engaged with the long-term implications of cartographic omission.\nBecause Palestine, after all, has been removed. It is there on old paper maps, of the Holy Land, of the Roman and Ottoman empires, of the British mandate. Yet in our digital age, a search on Google Maps for Israel produces a map without Palestine. It displays Israeli urban centres down to a few thousand inhabitants, and even marks Ma’ale Adumin, an Israeli settlement on the occupied West Bank. At the same time it shows no Palestinian place-names or urban centres, not even major ones like Gaza City, Khan Yunis or Nablus. The dotted, inconsistent borders of the occupied territories leave the impression that they are not claimed or administered by anyone.\nIsrael and the Palestinian territories on Google Maps, 19 August 2016.

Other map controversies are about where borders should be drawn between two sovereign states, yet at stake in the case of Palestine is whether the country and its people exist at all. Israeli nationalists have long denied this – the architects of Israel even rallied under the slogan “a land without a people for a people without a land”. Palestine is presently the only state recognised by the UN not to appear on Google Maps. [See footnote.]\nHistorians of cartography have long studied the practices and consequences of cartographic omission. In a landmark study, “New England cartography and the Native Americans”, published posthumously in 1994, the British historian of cartography J. B. Harley analysed seventeenth-century maps to follow the progressive replacement of the Native Americans with European settlers. In Harley’s analysis, the maps were something more than historical records of that process. Because they made the colonists visible at the expense of the indigenous population, they were also instruments of colonial legitimisation.\nMany colonial mapmakers preferred to leave the areas of predominantly indigenous presence blank, rather than to reproduce an indigenous geography; one example is Herman Moll’s 1729 map of New England and the adjacent colonies, seen above. The traces of indigenous presence, past and present, were gradually removed from the maps as the colonists pushed west. The apparent emptiness helped to justify the settlers’ sense that they had discovered a virgin territory, promised to them by Providence. The pattern was the same in all areas of colonial activity, including Australia and Africa.\nJohn Smith’s map of New England, drawn in 1614 and later published in London, showing no traces of the indigenous population. Photograph: Wikimedia\nIncidentally, Harley’s study began as a conference paper entitled “Victims of a map”, a title he borrowed from an anthology of contemporary Palestinian and Lebanese poetry. Discussing the implications of not representing Native American place-names on colonial maps, Harley quoted the Israeli historian and political scientist Meron Benvenisti, deputy mayor and chief planning officer of Jerusalem in 1971­–78, who described the process with which the Israeli state Hebraized the place-names of the country they had conquered: “Like all immigrant societies, we attempted to erase all alien names”, Benvenisti said. “The Hebrew map of Israel constitutes one stratum in my consciousness, underlaid by the stratum of the previous Arab map.”\nIf a map were to represent a territory in all its detail, it would need to be as large as the territory itself, as famously noted by Jorge Luis Borges in his short story “On exactitude in science”. Thus, drawing a map always involves choices, whether they are reflected or not. In the conflict-ridden Middle East, those choices are often blatantly political. The official map of Israel, available on the web page of the Israeli government, integrates the occupied territories into Israel and is devoid of any Palestinian place-names. Conversely, Palestinian maps often label the whole country as Palestine – effectively a refusal to acknowledge the development since 1948.\nOfficial map of Israel, integrating the occupied territories and showing no Palestinian place-names, as seen on 18 August 2016. Photograph: Govmap\nDoes this mean we should suspect Google of any political agenda? As the project Disputed Territories demonstrated in 2014, Google Maps shows you different maps of disputed territories depending on which country you are in when you access them. Google, after all, is a commercial actor: they make their billions by pleasing their customers. In the polarised conflict over Palestine, not labelling the occupied territories as either Israeli or Palestinian might well cause the least total amount of indignation. Still it is only one of several possible solutions. If, as others have argued, we mapped political realities rather than conflicting political ideals, Google might have marked Palestine as an occupied territory, rather than as an independent state.\nMap is not territory, and introducing or removing a name on the map does not invalidate the existence of the thing it refers to: it was European colonists, not their maps, who dispossessed the Native Americans. But everyone who has been to school or who has navigated with a map knows how they direct our attention and shape our experience – and memory – of reality.\nImmersed in the values and evident truths of their time and place, but also eager to please their readers, mapmakers of the colonial era represented overseas territories from their particular perspective. Trying to stay impartial in the eyes of customers and the surrounding society, the mapmakers at Google similarly represent – and so reproduce – the world as it appears from their culturally encoded point of view. When they chose not to mark Palestine on their maps, they only codified into a cartographic image, how they and their fellow westerners already viewed the world.\nNote added 24 August 2016: State of Palestine is recognised by the UN as a non-member State.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Map resolution issues because it discusses the controversy surrounding Google Maps and its omission of Palestine from its maps.

New roads also pave the way to further exploitation by humans, such as poaching or mining, and new infrastructure.\nHumans have destroyed a tenth of Earth's wilderness in 25 years – study\nRead more\nAn international team of researchers analysed open-access maps of 36m km of road and found that over half of the 600,000 fragments of land in between roads are very small – less than 1km2.\nA mere 7% are bigger than 100km2, equivalent to a square area just 10km by 10km. Furthermore, only a third of the roadless areas were truly wild, with the rest affected by farming or people.\nThe last remaining large roadless areas are rainforests in the Amazon and Indonesia and the tundra and forests in the north of Russia and Canada. Virtually all of western Europe, the eastern US and Japan have no areas at all that are unaffected by roads. The scientists considered that land up to a kilometre on each side of a road was affected, which they believe is a conservative estimate.\nA global map of the ecological value of roadless areas.

But Ibisch said the road maps the team used, though the best available, were certain to be incomplete and that the true situation was even worse, for example in Borneo where many oil palm plantation roads have yet to be mapped.\nIbisch also said international attempts to protect the environment often ignored the importance of the last remaining roadless areas. “It is astonishing to see they have not taken into account roadless areas,” he said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Map resolution issues because it discusses the impact of roads on Earth's land and highlights the fragmentation caused by road construction.

REUTERS\/Leonhard Foeger\/Files\nA resolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Parchin file, which includes a demand for fresh IAEA access to the site, is a symbolically important issue that could help make or break Tehran’s July 14 nuclear deal with six world powers.\nThe confidential IAEA report, obtained by Reuters, said:\n“Since (our) previous report (in May), at a particular location at the Parchin site, the agency has continued to observe, through satellite imagery, the presence of vehicles, equipment, and probable construction materials. In addition, a small extension to an existing building” appeared to have been built.\nThe changes were first observed last month, a senior diplomat familiar with the Iran file said.\nThe IAEA says any activities Iran has undertaken at Parchin since U.N. inspectors last visited in 2005 could jeopardize its ability to verify Western intelligence suggesting Tehran carried out tests there relevant to nuclear bomb detonations more than a decade ago. Iran has dismissed the intelligence as “fabricated”.\nUnder a “road map” accord Iran reached with the IAEA parallel to its groundbreaking settlement with the global powers, it is required to give the Vienna-based watchdog enough information about its past nuclear activity to allow it to write a report on the long vexed issue by year-end.\n“Full and timely implementation of the relevant parts of the road-map is essential to clarify issues relating to this location at Parchin,” the new IAEA report said.\nAccording to data given to the IAEA by some member states, Parchin might have housed hydrodynamic experiments to assess how specific materials react under high pressure, such as in a nuclear blast.\n“We cannot know or speculate what’s in the (extended) building ... It’s something we will technically clarify over the course of the year,” the senior diplomat said. The report said the extended building was not the one that some countries suspect has housed the controversial experiments.\n“It’s funny that the IAEA claims there has been a small extension to a building ... Iran doesn’t need to ask for the IAEA’s permission to do construction work on its sites,” Reza Najafi, Iran’s envoy to the agency, was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nRejecting Iran deal would isolate Washington: U.S. envoy to U.N.\nGROUNDBREAKING NUCLEAR ACCORD\nUnder its Vienna accord with the powers, Iran must put verifiable limits on its uranium enrichment program to create confidence it will not be used to develop nuclear bombs, in exchange for a removal of sanctions crippling its economy. Iran has said its nuclear work is for only civilian uses.\nIran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium gas of a fissile purity of up to 5 percent had since May decreased by around 870 kilograms to 7,845.4 kg, the report said. Once the July deal is implemented, which is expected to happen some time next year, this stockpile must be reduced to 300 kg.\nIran has for years been accused of stonewalling the IAEA inquiry into “possible military dimensions” (PMD) of its nuclear project. But the Islamic Republic delivered on a pledge under the “road map” to turn over more information by Aug. 15.\nThe IAEA report said the agency was still reviewing the PMD information Iran provided. Agency Director-General Yukiya Amano said on Tuesday the information was substantive but it was too early to say whether any of it was new.\nThe success of the deal between Iran and the powers will hinge on IAEA verification of Iranian compliance.\nThe agency has come under pressure, especially from U.S. lawmakers who will hold a critical vote next month on whether to ratify the deal between Iran and the powers, for not publishing its “road map” agreement with Tehran.\nAmano last week rejected as “a misrepresentation” suggestions from hawkish critics of the nuclear accord that the IAEA had quietly agreed to allow Iran to inspect sections of Parchin on the agency’s behalf.\nAdditional reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin Nouri in Dubai; Editing by Andrew Roche\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to map resolution issues as it discusses the potential construction and extension activities at Iran's Parchin military site.

{"num":80,"Time":"Thu 2 Oct 2014 08.00 CEST","Title":"Counting trees to save the woods: using big data to map deforestation","Content":"Forests provide benefits few of us appreciate. They store carbon and mitigate the impacts of climate change, preserve biodiversity and ecosystem stability. They provide resources we all use, and more than a billion people around the world depend on forests directly for their livelihoods.\nBut forests are under more pressure today than ever. Between 2000 and 2012, the world lost a net 1.5 million square kilometres of tree cover, an area roughly the size of Mongolia. The clearing and burning of forests is responsible for between 12-20% of greenhouse gas emissions. In response, a major declaration on forests was signed at the UN climate summit in September, committing to end global deforestation by 2030. But one major barrier to curbing the destruction of forests around the world remains: the lack of reliable data that tells us precisely when and where it’s happening.\nTo fill this data gap, we created Global Forest Watch (GFW) – an online platform combining hundreds of thousands of satellite images, high-tech data processing and crowd-sourcing, to provide near-real time data on the world’s forests. Our goal is to enable governments, companies, NGOs, and the public to better manage forests, track illegal deforestation and more.\nBut big data comes with big challenges. From the start, GFW grappled with a lack of public data, barriers to participation, and confusion over terminology. In our experience, these challenges are common to data-driven initiatives that aim to enable public use of big data. So as we push forward with Global Forest Watch, we thought we would share a few lessons that might help other big data initiatives seeking to tackle climate change.\nBuilding support for open data\nIt can be difficult to manage the process of opening up previously exclusive data – like the locations of concessions for logging, agriculture, and mining – for public use. Global Forest Watch compares this data with satellite-detected tree cover loss to determine where harmful or illegal activities might be taking place. Governments may release official deforestation statistics, but not simple ways for the public to verify these numbers. And without a history of public data-sharing, even virtuous countries, companies, and researchers may be reluctant to share their information, for fear of losing control over how it would be used.\nDespite these concerns, many groups have embraced open and transparent data recently. In June, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil released via GFW the first detailed public maps of their certified concessions, which Global Forest Watch now uses in its analyses. As the open data movement slowly gains trust and traction, big data tools like GFW will have more and more material to work with.\nReaching out to those who know the forests\nSatellite images and data processing techniques can only do part of the work. Global Forest Watch was built to allow users to contribute their own data to provide local context, such as: maps of protected areas, concessions, or land ownership, or short stories explaining why forests were lost, regrown, or conserved in a particular area. However, despite hundreds of thousands of visitors to the GFW website, relatively few submitted their own data or content. So we have learned that outreach on the ground is indispensable and are now showcasing GFW for governments, local communities, and businesses around the world. We have also been looking for ways to better engage users online. We are now working with TomNod, a crowdsourcing platform that is part of Digital Globe, a GFW partner, that uses ultra-high resolution satellite imagery to identify areas in Indonesia where forests and other sensitive ecosystems have been cleared by fire for agriculture or due to land conflict. These detailed satellite pictures have prompted almost 300,000 “tags” on the images, identifying over 24,000 active fires. This data will be posted online for the public and law enforcement officials.\nA forest by any other name\nProviding data on forests for both technical experts and the broad public requires caution in defining key terms and describing exactly what the data show. The term “forest” is particularly fraught, with many countries and experts defining forest by different thresholds for canopy cover, some including “plantation forests” in their definition, while others exclude it. “Deforestation” is even more confusing, with over 800 competing definitions. Satellites tend to be agnostic to such definitional questions and, without extensive additional analysis, measure only tree cover loss, showing where trees were but no longer are or vice versa. Without consistent definitions, there is increased risk that the data on GFW may be misinterpreted, or dismissed as not relevant. Clarifying and responding to critiques and inquiries about the data has therefore become a major priority for the project, along with continually improving response to such feedback. It has also inspired new research efforts, including an extensive project to map the extent of degradation in the world’s pristine intact forests, and an initiative to map plantation forests in key countries across the world.

{"num":85,"Time":"18 November 2019","Title":"Israel and the Palestinians: Can the settlement issue be solved?","Content":"Israel and the Palestinians: Can the settlement issue be solved?\nPublished\n18 November 2019\nShare\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nAFP\nImage caption,\nIsrael's prime minister has vowed never to remove settlements again\nThe issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has long been a major source of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, and most of the international community. The Trump administration has now, however, stated that settlements are not inconsistent with international law.\nHere is a brief guide to what it is all about.\nWhat are settlements?\nSettlements are communities established by Israel on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.\nThis includes the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. The West Bank and East Jerusalem had previously been occupied by Jordan since the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli War.\nAccording to the Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now, there are 132 settlements and 113 outposts - settlements built without official authorisation - in the West Bank. The group says more than 413,000 settlers live there, with numbers increasing year on year.\nIt says there are 13 settlements in East Jerusalem, inhabited by about 215,000 settlers.\nIsrael also established settlements in the Gaza Strip, seized from Egypt in the 1967 war, but it dismantled them when it withdrew from the territory in 2005. It also built settlements in the Sinai Peninsula, seized too from Egypt in 1967, but removed them in 1982 as part of a peace agreement with Cairo.\nThere are also dozens of settlements on the occupied Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 war.\nBuilt-up settlement areas occupy about 2% of the West Bank but critics point out that the land controlled by settlement activity, such as agriculture and roads, amounts to much more than that and requires a heavy military presence.\nSettlers themselves choose to live in these communities for a range of reasons - from economic, encouraged by government subsidies, to religious, based on the belief that God gave the land to the Jewish people.\nWhy are settlements so contentious?\nWhat happens with settlements has proven to be one of the most intractable issues between Israel and the Palestinians, and rows about them have caused the collapse of numerous rounds of peace talks.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nThere are dozens of unauthorised settlements, known as outposts, across the West Bank\nPalestinians say the presence of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land they seek for a future state - make such a state with contiguous territory impossible. They have demanded Israel freeze all settlement activity as a precondition for resuming peace talks.\nPalestinians' freedom of movement is also restricted by hundreds of checkpoints, roadblocks and other obstacles used to protect both settlements and Israel from militants.\nMedia caption,\nIs Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach?\nIsrael says the Palestinians are using the issue of settlements as a pretext to avoid direct talks.\nUnder the 1993 Israel-Palestinian Oslo peace accords, the issue of settlements was to be deferred until final status talks - a reason why Israel objects to pre-conditions and UN resolutions on the matter.\nWhat has changed under Donald Trump?\nIn two words - a lot.\nFrom the beginning of his presidency in January 2017, Donald Trump has displayed a much more tolerant attitude towards settlement activity than his predecessor, Barack Obama.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nAFP\nImage caption,\nDonald Trump has rarely criticised Israeli settlement activity\nUp until Mr Trump took office, the US had described the settlements as \"illegitimate\", refraining from calling them \"illegal\" since the Carter administration in 1980.\nAre there alternatives to a two-state solution?\nA UN Security Council resolution in December 2016 said settlements had \"no legal validity and constitute[d] a flagrant violation under international law\". However, like previous resolutions on Israel, those adopted under Chapter VI of the UN Charter are not legally binding.\nOn 18 November 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration was reversing the stance of the previous administration.\n\"The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements is not, per se, inconsistent with international law,\" Mr Pompeo said.\nThe Trump administration has also overturned decades of US policy by recognising Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights - to the outrage of Palestinians - making the future of Jewish settlements there much more secure.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also gone further than ever before by declaring his intention to effectively annex all Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as well as the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea in the eastern West Bank, without fear of rebuke by the US. According to media reports, the plan is consistent with Mr Trump's vision for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, expected to be released in the near future.\nThe Palestinians have warned that if Israel extends sovereignty to the settlements, it will kill the peace process.\nWhat makes Jerusalem a special case?\nEven if agreement could be reached on settlements in the West Bank, the issue of settlements in East Jerusalem is even more thorny.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nAFP\nImage caption,\nIsrael does not regard places like Har Homa in East Jerusalem as settlements\nIsrael regards East Jerusalem as its eternal, indivisible capital and does not consider the sector in any way occupied - and by extension, it does not regard Jewish neighbourhoods there as settlements.\nIsrael officially extended sovereignty over East Jerusalem in 1980, in a move not accepted internationally until Washington broke rank and recognised the whole of Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2017. Only Guatemala and Honduras have followed suit (Paraguay did, but reversed its decision).\nSo is a deal on settlements impossible?\nIt looks increasingly likely. For years, Israel said it was prepared to make \"painful concessions\" for peace - code for withdrawal from occupied territory and an accompanying removal of some smaller settlements. It previously demolished settlements in Sinai and Gaza, and four small sites in the West Bank in 2005, during pull-outs.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nIsrael demolished its settlements in Gaza before it withdrew in 2005\nWhile Israel and the Palestinians agreed to decide upon the fate of existing settlements, and Jerusalem, in the final stage of peace talks, the chances of reaching that point seem further away than ever.\nMr Netanyahu has crystallised his position, vowing never to dismantle settlements - and if he follows through with his plan to annex them, it will effectively take the issue off the table as far as Israel is concerned.\nAre settlements illegal under international law?\nMost of the international community, including the UN and the International Court of Justice, say the settlements are illegal.\nThe basis for this is the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention which forbids the transfer by an occupying power of its people to occupied territory.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nAFP\nImage caption,\nIsrael and the UN have repeatedly clashed over the issue of settlements\nHowever, Israel says the Fourth Geneva Convention does not apply de jure to the West Bank because, it says, the territory is not technically occupied.\nIsrael says it is legally there as a result of a defensive war, and did not take control of the West Bank from a legitimate sovereign power.\nIt says the legal right of Jewish settlement there as recognised by the 1922 League of Nations Mandate for Palestine was preserved under the UN's charter.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The news article discusses the issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which has long been a major source of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.\",\n\"It provides information about the number of settlements and settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, highlighting the contentious nature of these settlements.\",\n\"The article also mentions that the Trump administration, at the time, stated that settlements are not inconsistent with international law, which is a significant development in the ongoing debate over settlements.\",\n\"It discusses how settlements have been a major obstacle in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians and how they have caused the collapse of numerous rounds of negotiations.\",\n\"The article mentions the change in the U.S. stance under President Donald Trump, who displayed a more tolerant attitude towards settlement activity compared to his predecessor.\",\n\"It highlights the controversial move of recognizing Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, which has implications for the future of Jewish settlements in those areas.\",\n\"The article discusses Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intention to annex all Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the Jordan Valley, and the northern Dead Sea, which is a significant development in the settlement issue.\",\n\"It mentions the international community's view that most settlements are illegal under international law, citing the Fourth Geneva Convention as the basis for this stance.\"\n]\n}","From":"bbc.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-38458884","query_name":"updated_file_Map_resolution_issues.xlsx"}

{"num":91,"Time":"Sat 27 Aug 2005 01.17 CEST","Title":"Road map for US relations with rest of world","Content":"For any student of the Bush administration's foreign policy, the US version of the draft United Nations summit agreement, leaked earlier this week, is an essential text.\nThe hundreds of deletions and insertions represent a helpfully annotated map to Washington's disagreements with most of the rest of the world on just about every global issue imaginable.\nMost of the disagreements illustrated in this document are longstanding. President Bush was never going to sign a document urging UN member states to support the Kyoto protocol on climate change, or the international criminal court. The mystery is how these differences surfaced only at the end of a long drafting process.\nThere are two versions of how this happened. The US delegation says it was raising its objections informally at meetings to discuss the draft, and was forced to circulate its blunt list of deletions and additions only after those objections were ignored.\nThe account provided by European officials at the UN explains the late timing of this intervention by turmoil inside the US foreign policy establishment. For the first seven months of this year, as the draft was being hammered out, the US had no full permanent representative at the UN. John Danforth retired in January, and the White House's attention was focused on persuading the Senate to confirm John Bolton. A career diplomat, Anne Patterson, led the delegation in the interim, but reportedly received little political guidance from Washington.\nWhen Mr Bolton arrived this month, finally forced in by the president with a temporary executive appointment, the change was dramatic. The leadership shifted from a non-political diplomat to one of the most ideological and partisan US permanent representatives in recent history.\nThe document reflects Mr Bolton's belief that the assertion of US interests should almost always take precedence over the search for compromise with an international community that includes despotic and corrupt regimes.\nOf particular interest is the repeated deletion of the word \"disarmament\" in the section on nuclear arms. The Bush administration wants global counter-proliferation strategy to focus exclusively on preventing more countries acquiring nuclear weapons. It is seeking to play down the importance of reducing the stockpiles of the established nuclear powers, as it has plans to overhaul its own arsenal and develop new weapons, such as nuclear \"bunker busters\".\nThe removal of any mention of the Millennium development goal for rich countries to donate 0.7% of their gross national product to the developing world, marks a final break with the pledge agreed by the Clinton administration. US overseas development assistance is below 0.2% and near the bottom of the league.\nThe deletion of references to \"corporate responsibility\" reflects an ingrained distaste for regulation of the private sector in the pursuit of social goals such as the elimination of poverty or the treatment of HIV in Africa.\nHere are some of the US changes:\nValues and principles\nWe further reaffirm that core values and principles, such as respect for human rights and human dignity, freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, [deleted: respect for nature], the rule of law, shared responsibility, multilateralism, and non-resort to the threat or use of force [inserted: in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations] are essential for peaceful coexistence and cooperation among states.\nWe rededicate ourselves to support [deleted: all] efforts to uphold ... the sovereign equality of all states, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence, non-interference in the internal affairs of states, resolution of disputes by peaceful means, and the right of self-determination of peoples [deleted: which remain under colonial domination and foreign occupation]\nWe pledge to make the United Nations more relevant, more effective, more efficient, more accountable and more credible [deleted: and to provide the organisation with the resources needed to fully implement its mandates].\nDevelopment\nWe [deleted: remain concerned, however, by the slow and uneven implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium development goals and] reaffirm our commitment to eradicate poverty and promote sustained economic growth, sustainable development and global prosperity for all.\nWe resolve to... make the fight against corruption at all levels a priority, as agreed at Monterey, and welcome all actions taken in this regard at the national and international levels including the adoption of policies that emphasise accountability, transparent public sector management, competitive markets [deleted: and corporate responsibility and accountability]\n[Deleted: We welcome the establishment of timetables by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7% of gross national product for official development assistance by no later than 2015 and to reach at least 0.5% by 2009 and urge those developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete efforts towards allocating 0.7% of their GNP for ODA...]\nProtecting our common environment\n[Deleted: We recognise that climate change is a serious and long-term challenge that has the potential to affect every part of the world. We call for further technological and financial international cooperation for the sustainable use and management of natural resources in order to promote sustainable production and consumption patterns as a means of keeping the balance between the conservation of natural resources and the furtherance of social and economic objectives.]\nWe therefore resolve to [deleted: undertake concerted global action to address climate change, including through meeting all commitments and obligations under the Kyoto protocol...].\nMeeting the special needs of Africa\nWe resolve to provide, as a priority, assistance for HIV\/AIDS prevention, care and treatment in African countries [deleted: on a grant basis, and encourage pharmaceutical companies to make anti-retroviral drugs affordable and accessible in Africa]\nUse of force under the UN charter\nWe also reaffirm that the provisions of the charter of the United Nations regarding the use of force are sufficient [deleted: to address the full range of security threats and agree that the use of force should be considered as an instrument of last resort].\nDisarmament and non-proliferation\nWe also recognise that non-compliance with existing arms control, non-proliferation and [deleted: disarmament] agreements and commitments also threatens international peace and security of all nations and increases the possibility of terrorist acquisition of WMD.\nWe reiterate our firm commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty [deleted: its three pillars, disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy].\nImpunity\n... we commit to end the impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes [deleted: by cooperating with the international criminal court, the existing ad hoc and mixed criminal tribunals and other mechanisms for international justice as well as through strengthening national legal systems].\nThe hostile messenger\nJohn Bolton is the perfect messenger for the blunt challenge Washington has thrown down to the international consensus. He is famous for his brusque manner and deep scepticism, verging on hostility, towards the UN.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearings, previous glib remarks came back to haunt him, such as the observation that if the UN headquarters \"lost 10 storeys today, it wouldn't make a bit of difference\".\nHe also came under scrutiny for claims he tried to have state department analysts sacked if they did not conform to his political beliefs.\nAfter months of wrangling, the White House had to resort to a \"recess appointment\", a means of bypassing the Senate, to get Mr Bolton to the UN. The manoeuvre sent a signal that although he was the president's envoy, he did not represent all of the US.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to Map resolution issues because it discusses the United States' disagreements and differences with the rest of the world on various global issues, which can be seen as a diplomatic 'map' of conflicts and resolutions.

Bush said this month he would urge NATO allies to begin the membership process for Georgia at the summit, but he faces west European resistance in the face of strong Russian opposition.\nWhen NATO foreign ministers met earlier this month, diplomats said 11 west European countries including France, Germany, Italy, Norway and Portugal spoke against giving Kiev and Tbilisi membership plans now.\nNO INTERIM DEAL\nThey have concerns over Georgia’s frozen conflicts and its imposition of a state of emergency and media clampdown in the face of opposition protests last year. The low level of public support for NATO in Ukraine is also a major hurdle.\nDiplomats said one of the sceptical NATO countries had since indicated it would not stand in the way of a MAP offer for the two, but said others were sticking to their position.\nOn Tuesday, Russian president-elect Dmitry Medvedev maintained pressure on NATO not to grant membership to Georgia or Ukraine, saying this would undermine European security.\nBakradze rejected concerns that granting Georgia a membership plan could inflame ties between Russia and the West. He argued that the transition in the Russian presidency from Vladimir Putin to Medvedev presented a “window of opportunity”.\n“Now it a unique time when there is no longer an old president and not yet the new president, so there is no personality in Russia who can take NATO’s enlargement as his personal failure.”\nMedvedev will be sworn in to succeed Putin in May.\nBakradze insisted Georgia was not interested in accepting an interim agreement leading to a future offer of MAP, as has been mooted by some diplomats as a possible move.\n“It is not a serious option for us.

The department publicly identified the shop as a high-risk location the day before he left Melbourne.\nThe driver, who worked as a tyre salesman, was a permitted worker. This meant he could travel outside Melbourne but otherwise had to adhere to the same restrictions as those in the city, such as not dining in cafes or visiting non-essential businesses, while visiting regional Victoria.\nBut he ate breakfast at the Oddfellows cafe in Kilmore before stopping at a tyre shop in Benalla and at another tyre shop and a Bunnings warehouse in Shepparton.\nIt is not clear when tracers assigned to the Chadstone case first spoke with close contacts of the butcher but on 2 October they spoke to the truck driver.\nHe admitted the Kilmore and Benalla travel but did not mention he had been to Shepparton.\nContact tracers linked the driver to Shepparton after a worker at the tyre centre tested positive on Tuesday afternoon. Two other workers at the centre have also tested positive.\nThere are now more than 40 cases linked to the Butcher Club outbreak, spread across Melbourne suburbs bordering Chadstone, suburbs in the outer south-east, suburbs in the outer north, and in regional Victoria. .\nOn Wednesday Andrews said he believed the new method of logging tracing data electronically was being used concurrently with the old system, which was seen as inefficient because it was largely paper-based.\nChecking out? Daniel Andrews' future hangs on Victoria's hotel quarantine inquiry\nRead more\nThe department confirmed to Guardian Australia that in the past month local public health units – or regional hubs – have been rolled out across Melbourne “to enhance the speed, efficiency and accuracy of our contact tracing processes”.\nThe sites are in Melbourne’s west, north-east and south-east, and more are expected to be established in coming weeks.\nBennett, who has worked in contact tracing in New South Wales, praised the department for its handling of the Kilmore outbreak, saying it was similar to the model favoured by NSW Health.\nUpdates to Victorian IT systems and the establishment of local health units would increase this capacity, she told Guardian Australia.\n“In New South Wales you have local area health services managing the contact tracing and they have built up relationships with local community leaders and businesses,” Bennett said.\n“This allows efficiency. When they’re talking to people about the pubs they’ve visited and the suburbs they’ve been to, they know exactly where they are talking about which also makes a difference.”\nGuardian Australia has been told that during the peak of Victoria’s second wave in August, private operators involved in the testing process became so concerned about the state’s contact tracing capacity that they introduced measures to limit the possibility that positive cases were infecting others.\nThe procedure once a person tests positive in Victoria is relatively straightforward : the clinician who tested the patient informs them of the positive result, the pathology company that completed the test informs the department, and the department contacts the patient to begin tracing.\nBut as the number of positive cases climbed into the hundreds, it became clear that the department would be unable to trace them all quickly.\nOne provider of clinical services, who did not wish to be identified, said he had instructed his workers to contact all positive cases a second time several days after they were informed of their diagnosis to ensure tracing of the patients had started and they were aware of how to properly isolate.\nVictoria Covid hotspots: list of Melbourne and regional case locations\nRead more\n“The problem up until five or six weeks ago was that it was all being done by fax and phone call and list creation,” he said. “That in itself was a slow process; can you imagine if you were a pathology company with 60 positives how long that would take? It was abysmal.”\nAndrews said on Wednesday that the truck driver had been referred to police but he and Sutton agreed that little would be gained by taking a more punitive approach to tracing.\nSutton suggested that, in some cases, the residency or work status of a person could result in them holding back on information given to tracers.\n“I recognise that there are issues that sometimes relate to a person wilfully hiding stuff and others who are genuinely fearful of consequences with respect to visa status. A lot of people have fears about what it might mean for their work.\n“They should all be reassured that no employer has a right to sack you, to stop giving you hours because you become infected with coronavirus and subsequently recover.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Map update lag or delays because it discusses delays in contact tracing, which can lead to the spread of COVID-19 in regional Victoria.

But the manufacturing times for both reagents and analysers for the increased number of tests that are planned have a bit of a lag.\n“The lag is about a few weeks. It’s a supply chain lag in that everything is based on forecasts. So when there’s a forecast for a certain number of tests, the supply chain adjusts to that. And when the forecast is changed, the supply chain adjusts to that. The lag develops when there’s a new forecast, but then it [supply] catches up. But they have been ordered and they will arrive,” she added.\nTimeline\nWhat the UK government said on Covid testing\nShow\nAsked what the effect of a lag could be, Dent said the current situation – where demand for tests is outstripping supply up to fourfold – was an example.\nJonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “Testing has become a shambles and it now looks like Boris Johnson’s promise of 500,000 test a day by October won’t be met.”\nMeanwhile, the Guardian has learned that ministers plan to spend more than £500m doubling the number of tests processed by laboratories at 16 hospital trusts as part of the effort to hit the 500,000 target. The NHS and Public Health England are currently able to process about a third of England’s testing capacity.\nThe money, which the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is preparing to announce, will pay for the physical expansion of existing facilities, purchase of equipment and hiring of clinical scientists.\nThe government has told suppliers it wants to buy 300 extra analysers, which, using the reagents, disclose if a swab sample is positive or negative. It is hoped each can do 200 to 300 tests a day, boosting NHS capacity by 60,000 to 90,000.\nBut one hospital chief executive said existing shortages of reagents and analysing machines would make it hard to expand NHS testing capacity quickly. “You live hand to mouth in terms of whether you’ve got the reagents or not. They’re in short supply, as are analyser machines,” they said.\nTell us: do you work in the UK test and trace service?\nRead more\n“If you’re going to expand these 16 hospital labs you need more analysing machines … The lack of them is an NHS-wide problem, a national and international problem.”\nMunira Wilson, the Lib Dem health spokesperson, said: “Ministers must break their dangerous habit of overpromising and underdelivering. It is eroding public trust.”\nThe DHSC said the target would be met. “We are on track to have capacity for 500,000 tests per day by the end of October. We have a planned supply of reagent, allowing us to increase capacity in NHS laboratories.\n“We are also automating parts of the process, installing new machines, hiring more permanent staff, opening new labs and investing in new technology to process results faster,” a spokesperson said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about delays in reaching the UK government's pledge of conducting 500,000 Covid tests a day.

That would help Indonesia reverse trade deficits that have weakened its currency and dented investor confidence in the region’s largest economy.\nUsing more biodiesel at home would also help offset a likely fall in exports after major customer the European Union agreed to impose punitive duties on Indonesia for selling the fuel at unfairly low prices.\nJakarta’s energy ministry in August issued a new regulation - to go into effect next year - raising the minimum bio content in diesel to 10 percent, up from levels of 3-10 percent. For the power industry, the minimum was doubled to 20 percent.\nBut Indonesia is already failing to meet its existing domestic biodiesel requirements despite plentiful palm oil supplies and abundant refining capacity, and analysts say the new regulations will not be met overnight.\n“The stumbling block is whether they can roll it out to the rest of the region where they have not done the logistical preparation,” said Ivy Ng, senior research analyst at Malaysia’s CIMB Investment Bank.\nIndonesia’s current biodiesel consumption is estimated at about 5 million barrels a year, about half the 9.4 million barrels it should use under current rules, according to the Indonesian Biofuel Producers Association (APROBI).\nThe new regulation would take consumption to around 25 million barrels if implemented in full, but Ng said she expected consumption to rise to about 12.5 million barrels by 2015.\nA consumption boost will benefit biofuel producers and plantation owners such as Wilmar International and Astra Agro Lestari, but the sticking point will be how quickly the oil industry and consumers respond to the new rule.\nREDUCING IMPORTS\nIndonesia has to import up to 6 million barrels of diesel a month, about 40 percent of its total oil product consumption, because the refining capacity at state-owned oil company Pertamina can only meet around two-thirds of demand.\nIf the new regulation was fully implemented, Indonesia would import around a third less diesel, saving more than $200 million a month based on benchmark diesel prices GO25-SIN, according to industry and Reuters calculations.\nAnalysts and industry officials point to insufficient blending capacity at Pertamina, as well as a lack of the separate shipping and storage capacity needed for biodiesel, as a reason for not meeting usage requirements.\nTransporting biodiesel from the domestic hubs on Java and Sumatra islands is more expensive than shipping diesel direct from Singapore due to the limited availability of tankers, said APROBI general secretary Paulus Tjakrawan.\nPertamina though says it can ship the required level of biodiesel, blaming the slow take-up so far on concerns that the blend can damage engines.\n“There are some challenges from the car industry. All of the cars can use this blended fuel, but it could impact the engine in the future,” said Pertamina refinery director, Chrisna Damayanto.\n“Car producers are already complaining to the government about these problems.”\nIndonesia’s powerful auto industries lobby group GAIKINDO has said the new biodiesel blend can lead to a rise in fuel consumption and overheating in the types of engines used in Indonesia.\nFor consumption of the blended fuel to eventually meet targets, Ng said state power company PLN would need to convert to biodiesel at its diesel-fired power generators.\nPLN president director Nur Pamudji told Reuters the power company would adopt the new standard with its existing infrastructure.\n“There won’t be a problem with storage tanks - the existing tanks can be used straight away,” Pamudji said in a text message, adding that the new regulation would have no impact on the power company’s diesel engines.

It provides access to a new orc-controlled planet, called Draenor.\n\"While the majority of our players are able to play, we're very sorry that many are stuck in queues before they're able to get in, due to a combination of demand and the mitigating measures we've taken,\" a spokesman for Blizzard told the BBC.\n\"We've been working around the clock to upgrade hardware as well as implement further software solutions so that we can reduce the queues to get in, and we've already seen considerable improvement.\"\nOther titles currently experiencing server problems include Microsoft's sci-fi shooter, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which also went on sale last week.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nMICROSOFT\/SONY\nImage caption,\nHalo: The Masterchief Collection and Driveclub have also been beset by server problems\nIts developer, 343 Industries, has acknowledged \"frustrating\" bugs with its Matchmaking system, which links players together over the internet for multiplayer battles.

REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse\nSports Minister Pavel Kolobkov said Russia would “work diligently” towards a clean culture and listed what he said was progress on restructuring its anti-doping system after years of cheating scandals across a wide range of sports.\n“We are open for all kinds of inspections of individual athletes and organisations such as RUSADA,” he told an international meeting in Lausanne.\n“We are ready to pass any kind of external inspection.”\nA series of reports by WADA have found that Russia conducted rampant state-sponsored doping, leading to the country’s track-and-field federation being barred from last year’s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe vast majority of Russian competitors also seem certain to miss the world athletics championships in London in August.\nWADA President Craig Reedie said RUSADA, suspended in 2015 for systematically breaking anti-doping rules, had taken steps forward in the past year, but more were needed.\n“There remains significant work to do. (RUSADA) must demonstrate its processes are autonomous and independent from outside interference,” Reedie told the Lausanne meeting.\nHe later told Reuters that Russia was lagging behind the agreed reform schedule but progress was being made with potential compliance still possible before the end of 2017.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nU.S. anti-doping chief says WADA is 'fox guarding hen house'\n“Timing is crucial. The road map slips, I have to say, every now and then,” Reedie said. “They (Russians) know it slips, there has been admission of fault. But I think we are making progress.\n“If you look at the road map then it is possible for this to happen (to be compliant within 2017),” Reedie added.\nIn a reminder of the continuing fallout from the scandal, the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Monday upheld a lifetime ban on Sergei Portugalov, former chief of the Russian Athletics Federation’s Medical Commission, for his role in providing illicit substances to Russian competitors.\nIn a 2015 report, WADA had written that Portugalov supplied performance-enhancing drugs to athletes and coaches, administered doping programmes and “even injected athletes himself”.\n“SIMPLY INHUMAN”\nKolobkov was at times conciliatory, at times defiant. He described the Rio track-and-field ban as a “tragedy”, and Russia’s exclusion from the Paralympics in the Brazilian city as “simply inhuman”.\n“Clean athletes should not be deprived of the chance to take part in competition at any level as this contradicts the ideals of sports,” he said.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month denied state-sponsored doping but acknowledged there had been individual instances of cheating that indicated the country’s current system was not working.\nSlideshow ( 10 images )\n“The ball is in their camp and we will see when they will be able to deliver this programme,” WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said.\nA WADA-commissioned report by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren found state-backed doping involved more than 1,000 Russian athletes.\nMcLaren told the meeting: “(The) state sponsor from a Russian perspective is Putin and the inner circle.\n“The evidence we have is up to the sports minister. It stops there,” he said, referring to Kolobkov’s predecessor Vitaly Mutko.\n“Institutional or not, there are many words you can use...

A gene that helps the brain make connections may underlie a significant number of autism cases, researchers in the United States reported on Tuesday. REUTERS\/NIGS\/Kim Hager\/University of California, Los Angeles\/Handout\nDisruptions in the gene, called contactin 4, stop the gene from working properly and appear to stop the brain from making proper networks, the researchers reported in the Journal of Medical Genetics.\nThese disruptions, in which the child has either three copies of the gene or just one copy when two copies is normal, could account for up to 2.5 percent of autism cases, said Dr. Eli Hatchwell of Stony Brook University Medical Center in New York, who led the study.\n“That is a significant number,” said Hatchwell.\n“Generally the mistake that people make is they are looking for one unifying cause for autism, and there is no such thing and there never will be,” Hatchwell said in a telephone interview.\nHe said his finding adds to the list of potential tests for autism, and perhaps treatments for a range of conditions known as autism spectrum disorders.\nHatchwell’s team tested 92 patients from 81 families with autism spectrum disorder and compared them to 560 people without autism.\nThey did a whole genome analysis, looking at the entire DNA map, and found three of the patients had deletions or duplications of DNA that disrupted contactin 4.\nThey were all inherited from fathers without a history of autism, which can cause severe social and developmental delays and even mental retardation.\nThis may seem like a small number but millions of people have some type of autism, Hatchwell noted. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in every 150 children has autism or a related disorder such as Asperger’s syndrome, which is marked by often mild social awkwardness.\n“Autism is a syndrome. These individuals have all been grouped together as having the same thing. There will be many, many dozens if not hundreds of different causes,” he said.\nMUTATION PRESENT AT BIRTH\nContactin 4 is involved in the development of axons, which are the long strings that connect one neuron to another. Other\ndisruptions of this gene are known to cause developmental delay and mental retardation.\nThe genetic mutation is present at birth, Hatchwell said.\n“In each case a father who was reported as normal had the same thing,” he added.\n“This happens in genetics all the time. Often there are cases in which someone is reported as normal. They pass it on to their child, who has severe disease.”\nIt could be the fathers had mild Asperger’s or some other condition that was never diagnosed when they were children. Hatchwell noted that parents today in the United States are far more likely to seek a diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder in their children than parents were in past generations.\nThis is controversial, with some advocates and experts saying autism and related disorders have become more common in recent years, and others saying there is no evidence this has occurred.\n“My personal view is that it is not becoming more prevalent,” said Hatchwell. “If a parent has a child with some sort of learning problem, if they get labeled as autism they get all sorts of help at school,” he added.\nHatchwell has helped found a biotechnology company called Population Diagnostics Inc. to develop DNA based pre-symptomatic and early detection tests for autism, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Type 2 diabetes and other genetic diseases.\nIn 2004 researchers at Yale University found one child with developmental delays who had a deleted copy of contactin 4. In January, they and two other teams linked a gene called contactin associated protein-like 2 with some cases of autism, and a third team found a stretch of DNA on chromosome 16 that they said may cause 1 percent of autism cases.\nEditing by Cynthia Osterman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Based on the provided news article, it does appear to be relevant to problems related to genetics and autism, specifically the role of the gene \"contactin 4\" in autism cases.

REUTERS\/Kayhan Ozer\/Pool\nNabucco’s backers in May said it would open two years later than planned and cost more than its target of 7.9 billion euros (7 billion pounds). The link aims to ease Europe’s reliance on Russian gas by delivering supplies through a new southern route.\nSeveral setbacks this year mainly due to talks with gas producers have deepened doubts about the project, which has been under discussion since 2002 and has not signed any supply deals.\nBut Germany’s decision to kill atomic power by 2022 in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster and progress in talks with supplier Azerbaijan have revived Nabucco.\nAnalysts say it has become more attractive to countries wanting to avoid atomic power or heavy reliance on high-polluting coal.\n“The new German energy strategy will be a push for Nabucco,” said Claudia Kemfert, an energy analyst at the Berlin-based DIW economic institute. “It seemed almost dead but the nuclear decision has revived it.”\nShe said it was the most obvious way for Europe to reduce dependence on Russian gas and that it was important for Germany, which in the meantime may be forced to boost its share of Russian gas supply through Gazprom’s Nord Stream pipeline.\n<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nFor a map of planned gas pipelines to Europe click here\nhere\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\nWill Pearson, an analyst at Eurasia Group in London, said Italy’s recent referendum, in which an overwhelming majority of voters chose to ban nuclear energy for decades, underscores the positive prospects for a southern corridor pipeline.\n“Italy, along with Germany, will be a leading advocate of moving forward with the decision-making process in the aftermath of Fukushima,” Pearson said.\nNabucco plans to bring up to 31 billion cubic metres of gas annually from the Caspian region to an Austrian hub, bypassing Russia and altering the balance of regional power supplies. It aims to start transporting gas from 2017.\nBacked by the European Union, its partners include Germany's RWE RWEG.DE, Turkey's Botas, Austria's OMV OMVV.VI, Hungarian MOL MOLB.BU, Romania's Transgaz TGNM.BX and Bulgarian Bulgargaz.\nGAS TO FILL THE GAP\nEU Energy Commisioner Guenther Oettinger has said Germany will lose 23 percent of its electricity production when its nuclear power plants go off line. This translates into a 6 percent gap in the EU’s electricity supply, he said.\nBut while Europe may want more gas from outside Russia as energy demand rises, talks with suppliers have dragged on as their governments weigh advances from several competing plans.\nA January joint statement between the EU and Azerbaijan requiring the provision of a 20 bcm per year dedicated export pipeline from Baku to Europe could be key.\n“There is certainly more than enough Azeri gas to get the full pipeline started,” said Jennifer Coolidge of CMX Caspian and Gulf Consultants.\n“The significant development is Azerbaijan and the EU’s requirement for a new dedicated pipeline across the Caucasus and Turkey.”\nThis may put Nabucco ahead of other smaller European projects such as the Interconnector-Turkey-Greece-Italy and the Trans Atlantic Pipeline, which are also competing for Azeri gas.\nAzerbaijan's Shah Deniz field is being developed by BP BP.L and Statoil STL.L as well as Azeri state energy firm SOCAR and some others. It is estimated to contain 1.2 trillion cubic metres of gas. Production began in 2006, and the second phase is expected to begin by 2017.\nAzerbaijan has been in talks with more than 20 firms and consortiums looking to buy gas from Shah Deniz II and has said it wanted to conclude negotiations this year.\nState energy giant Gazprom GAZP.MM signed a deal with SOCAR in September 2010 to buy 2 bcm of gas in 2011 and even more from 2012.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information because it discusses the Nabucco pipeline project.

REUTERS\/Umit Bektas\nRussia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, resumed air strikes against insurgents in Idlib on Tuesday following weeks of bombardment and shelling by pro-Syrian government forces in an apparent prelude to a full-scale offensive against the rebels’ last major enclave.\nThe leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran are due to meet on Friday in Iran and are expected to discuss the situation in northwestern Syria. Turkey, which backs rebels against Assad, has said an offensive on Idlib would be disastrous. Ankara is sheltering 3.5 million Syrian refugees.\n“We will take the situation to a positive point at this summit .... God willing, we will be able to hinder the Syrian government’s extremism in the region,” the Hurriyet newspaper quoted Erdogan as saying overnight.\nOn Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu echoed his comments and called to end the bombing of Idlib, where millions of civilians also live.\n“If the problem here is the radical groups, a common strategy needs to be adopted. Joint work can be done to eliminate these groups but the solution is definitely not to bomb Idlib in its entirety,” Cavusoglu told a press conference.\nTurkey has told Russia that these attacks were wrong, particularly before the Tehran summit, he added.\nRussia has described Idlib as a “nest of terrorists” and a “festering abscess” that must be resolved. A Syrian rebel and a war monitor said Russian air strikes on the province had resumed on Tuesday after a pause of several weeks.\nErdogan, speaking to reporters on his plane back from a visit to Kyrgyzstan, also warned about the potential influx of refugees from Idlib to Turkey in the case of such an offensive, the Hurriyet said.\n“In a situation like this, where will the fleeing people go to?

Saturno was surprised to see a pattern of discoloration in the satellite image that outlined some of the buildings he had already uncovered.\nUsing a GPS device, he pinpointed on a map the location of other discolorations nearby and discovered several areas with hidden Mayan architecture.\nThe Maya built with limestone and lime plasters. As the abandoned buildings disintegrate, chemicals from the stones seep into the soil, keeping some plants from growing around the structures and affecting the chemistry of those that do grow.\nThe satellite can spot these differences and the result is a virtual road map of the buried structures from nearly 400 miles (640 kms) above Earth’s surface.\nCLUES TO COLLAPSE\nSaturno said he expects more discoveries like his 2001 find of an elaborate mural from around 100 B.C. depicting the Mayan creation myth, dubbed the Sistine Chapel of the Mayan world.\nHis research partner at NASA, Tom Sever, hopes the satellite images could provide clues as to why the Mayan civilization collapsed around 900 A.D.\n“What we are investigating is the choices the Maya made that ultimately created a catastrophic situation for them,” Sever said by telephone from a NASA base in the U.S. state of Alabama.\nTo support a population boom the Maya felled huge swathes of jungle for agriculture. They collected water in giant reservoirs called “bajos” to farm during seasonal dry spells, but the deforestation raised temperatures and reduced rainfall, drying up water sources, Sever said.\nBajos were found at around half the new sites located by the satellite, potentially boosting this theory of why the Maya had to leave their cities.\nInformation about the fate of the Maya could help modern societies make better choices and “avoid the sometimes disastrous mistakes of the past,” said Sever. “We are in a race against time to preserve our history.”\nWriting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Catherine Bremer and David Wiessler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant as it discusses the use of satellites to discover the ruins of hidden Mayan cities in the Guatemalan jungle.

Obama also promised a large infusion of funds into research on autism, which affects an estimated 1 in 150 U.S. children.\n“This kind of investment will also lead to new jobs: tens of thousands of jobs conducting research, manufacturing and supplying medical equipment, and building and modernizing laboratories and research facilities,” Obama said in a speech at the National Institutes of Health outside Washington.\n“The more than 12,000 grant awards ... are part of an overall $100 billion Recovery Act investment in science and technology to lay the foundation for the innovation economy of the future,” the White House statement added.\nObama also promoted his signature political initiative, healthcare reform, saying that decades of research “make no difference to the family that is dropped from an insurance policy when a child gets sick.”\nObama took a swipe at former president George W. Bush, widely accused of packing scientific advisory panels with supporters of his conservative political ideology.\nSCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY\n“If we’re honest, in recent years we’ve seen our leadership slipping as scientific integrity was at times undermined and research funding failed to keep pace,” Obama said.\n“We know that the work you do would not get done if left solely to the private sector. Some research does not lend itself to quick profit,” he said.\nThe NIH often conducts or pays for basic scientific research, and then licenses the findings to drug or biotechnology companies to develop into products.\nThe awards will take the form of grants, meaning that institutions and researchers will have to apply for them.\nMore than $1 billion will go to genomic research -- studying the DNA map to find causes of diseases, especially cancer, and potential new treatments.\n“We are about to see a quantum leap in our understanding of cancer,” said NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins.\nHe said cancer “occurs when glitches in the DNA cause a good cell to go bad”.\n“This ambitious effort promises to open new windows into the biology of all cancers, transform approaches to cancer research and raise the curtain on a more personalized era of cancer care,” added Collins, who as head of the National Human Genome Research Institute led efforts to sequence the human genome.\nSome of the most successful cancer drugs, such as Novartis AG's NOVN.VX Gleevec and Herceptin and Avastin, made by Genentech, now owned by Roche AG ROG.VX, target specific mutated genes.\nThe investment includes $175 million for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to collect 20,000 tissue samples from people with more than 20 different types of cancer.

REUTERS\/Paresh Dave\/Illustration\nThe previously unreported moves by the Colombian government add to a growing number of accounts of countries adopting the Apple-Google technology and dropping alternatives aimed at helping them curtail outbreaks faster.\nContact tracing involves identifying, testing and isolating people exposed to the virus before they spread it to others, something that governments globally have said is vital to keep their economies safely opened until a vaccine exists. Apps that tap the Bluetooth sensors in smartphones to detect encounters with those who test positive could speed the process, experts say.\nBut some governments that planned to forge ahead with such apps without the help of the American technology giants have been forced to reverse course. The head of Australia’s contact-tracing app told senators on Tuesday his team is moving to the Apple-Google technology over a glitchy internal solution, and the government agency behind the U.K.’s forthcoming app disclosed in a contract signed on Tuesday that it is asking engineers to test the Apple-Google system amid privacy concerns about its previously planned alternative.\nThe decisions have wide ramifications for using smartphone apps to log encounters between people to make it easier to find and alert those who crossed paths with a virus-carrier.\nApple and Google have said their Bluetooth-based technology will work more smoothly than alternatives and be trusted by consumers wary of government surveillance, with the companies banning government collection of app users’ GPS location and other personal data. Several governments including France, the United Kingdom and some U.S. states contend Apple and Google’s rules to protect privacy prevent the robust data analysis needed to slow the virus’ spread.\nBut Colombia’s struggle to use alternative technology highlights the challenges that await governments reluctant to accept Apple’s and Google’s terms.\n“There have certainly been several lessons learned in this process,” Colombia presidential adviser Victor Munoz told Reuters.\nROADBLOCKS ON IPHONES\nThe Colombian government had felt well on its way with its CoronApp, which had been downloaded by 4.3 million people as of May 2 and also includes features to report symptoms and see where cases are located on a map.\nBut the CoronApp dropped its contact tracing feature last month just days after launching it.\nApple and Google, the leading makers of smartphone operating systems, allow government contact tracing apps to bypass their technology. But without it, iPhones do not send a readable Bluetooth signal while locked, a feature designed to prevent tracking and save battery life.\nContact tracing apps are useless unless at least about half of a population downloads them, and iPhone usage is too substantial in most countries to be ignored.\nSo CoronApp used alternative technology from Portuguese company HypeLabs, which sells networking technology to gaming apps and other businesses, that purports to overcome the iPhone Bluetooth limitation.\nBut Munoz said Colombia encountered multiple challenges with the contact tracing feature that relied on HypeLabs, including inaccuracies in logging contacts using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\nColombia needed a better way to “minimize the risk of generating unnecessary alerts” and decided to align CoronApp with the Apple-Google technology instead, Munoz added.\nHis team had met representatives of Apple and Google and was studying their technology, he said.\n“It’s very important to us that we evaluate any alternative that can help the government make better decisions,” Munoz said.\nHypeLabs said it remains in discussions with several other countries.\nRandall Brugeaud, chief executive of Australia’s Digital Transformation Agency, said on Tuesday that the country’s COVIDSafe app increasingly struggles to log encounters the longer an iPhone remains locked.\n“The big shift in performance of Bluetooth connectivity will be the point we’re able to leverage the new Apple-Google Bluetooth management software,” he told senators.\nApple and Google last month began working on a joint solution to the connectivity problem between devices. But their offering, which will not be available for use until mid-May, restricts governments from amassing databases of people’s movements.\nColombia is one of several governments that has been hoping to gather such location data for use detecting coronavirus hotspots where businesses may need to be shut down or deep cleaned.\nAPPLE-GOOGLE COULD FALL SHORT\nOther developers are moving ahead to build contact tracing apps without Apple-Google technology. The Silicon Valley giants are authorizing their tools only for government contact-tracing apps. But several developers told Reuters they are fielding requests from large businesses that want apps for their workplaces.\n“We’ve talked to a pro sports team, companies in the food supply chain, a car dealership, nonprofits,” said Jamison Day, founder of Safe2, an app that uses HypeLabs’ technology to enable exposure notification.\nUsing only Bluetooth also could fall short, experts said. The coronavirus can spread through shared objects such as tables, and two people who sit in the same spot an hour apart would not be picked up by the Apple-Google Bluetooth system, said Aarathi Prasad, a professor of computer science at Skidmore College.\nPrivacy activists have praised the protections introduced by Apple and Google, noting legitimate concerns exist about how data from contact tracing apps could be misused by governments.\nWhether consumers trust elected officials or Apple and Google to better safeguard data collected by contact tracing remains a major question, with answers varying globally.\nHypeLabs co-founder Carlos Lei said he continues to field inquiries from government officials, whom he declined to name, who have reservations about embracing Apple and Google.\n“When it’s an entire world looking into a problem, it’s always better than having just one or two private companies looking into it,” Lei told Reuters.\nReporting by Paresh Dave and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington and Julia Symmes Cobb in Bogota; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by technology related to maps or geographical information.

The forecast today for Melbourne is a ball-dropping 44C.\nDancevic said it was \"inhumane\" to ask players to continue in the relentless heat. British star Andy Murray commented it was a bad look for the sport to have ball boys and girls, players and spectators collapsing.\nBut does human-caused climate change have anything at all to do with the water bottle-melting heat being endured by the players?\nFirst for the usual caveats.  Melbourne gets hot, and it has always experienced extremely hot days.\nYou can't blame climate change entirely for hot weather, but you can say that it increases the risk of extreme hot weather events occurring. The planet's atmosphere has been loaded with extra greenhouse gases, which gives the analogy of loading the weather dice to increase the chances of you rolling a six - or in this case, experiencing extremely hot days or seeing Snoopy.\nBlair Trewin, a senior climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology's National Climate Centre, told me that over the long term, Melbourne experiences 1.3 days above 40C every year.\nBut he says that between 2001 and 2013, the average across all those years was 1.9 days above 40C.\n\"Despite what people would have you believe, 40-degree days in Melbourne are not particularly common, and the city has gone as long as five years (1968 to 1973) without having any,\" he told me by email.\nHe says that when it comes to \"single day extremes\" there is a clear increase for the south east of the country, although it is much harder to see any trends in heat waves.\nDr Sarah Perkins is a researcher at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of New South Wales and specialises in studying heat waves.\nI asked her if human-caused climate change was contributing to charred bums and Snoopy sightings at the tennis.\n\"It's contributing,\" she says. \"In Melbourne we are seeing an increase in the amount of extreme heat – there's a disproportionate change when compared to the 1C increase we've seen in the average temperature for Australia.\n\"We are also seeing an increase in heat waves not just in Melbourne, but across Australia.\n\"Of course, summer is naturally hot and extreme temperature events will occur at this time of year. But we're now seeing much more of these events, that last longer, and are hotter. It's this trend that's concerning.\n\"Because of the background warming that's already there, there is a greater risk now of us seeing these events happen – so in that respect, it's game, set and match.\n\"Perhaps the bums wouldn't have been charred quite so much if there was no background warming trend\".\nShe says her studies have shown that since 1980, Melbourne is now experiencing an average of between one and two extra \"heat wave days\" every year. A heat wave day is a day that can contribute to a string of hot days.\nWhile an extra day or two doesn't sound like much, Perkins says the average heat wave days per year before 1980 was only between five and six.\nPerkins also says there are generally three natural climate phenomena related to extreme heat in the south east of the country.\nNone of these three \"modes\"– El Nino, the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode – were currently in cycles associated with higher extreme temperatures, says Perkins.\n\"We are seeing extreme events at times when natural variability alone can't explain what's happening.\"\nPerkins has also created a website - scorcher.com.au - which tracks heat waves across Australia almost as they happen (there's a two-day lag time). \nThe Bureau of Meteorology has also launched a pilot heat wave service to forecast extreme conditions and help the community, including health agencies, prepare.\nAustralia's Bureau of Meteorology's new service shows the heatwave in the Melbourne area during the first Tuesday of the 2014 Australian Open Tennis Championships. Image courtesy of Bureau of Meteorology\nPlainly, there is a clear health risk when people are exposed to extreme heat.  The young and elderly, the socially isolated and people with existing health problems are especially at risk.\nThe advice from health professionals is to avoid physical activity, drink lots of water and seek shade or air-conditioning.\nAvoiding physical activity obviously isn't an option for the tennis players, but they can look forward to cooler temperatures from Friday.\nIf we're asking if there's a link between Jelena Jancovik burning her bum on a seat and human-caused climate change, then the answer seems likely to be yes.\nAs for the future, it seems likely that the chances of more heat during the Australian Open are on the rise. A report from the independent Climate Council says in the future, the number of heat waves in Australia will \"increase significantly\".\nOrganisers might need to start thinking about some climate adaptation measures – including remembering to put a towel on Jelena Jankovic's chair.\nLook.

REUTERS\/Scott Audette\nAt the same time, companies must become more innovative and flexible to respond to rapidly evolving threats, industry executives and military officials said.\nU.S. commercial and military space has grown dramatically as a sector in recent years and in 2008 generated revenue of $257 billion, but tighter defense budgets and the global recession are likely to pose challenges in coming years.\nThe United States and Russia still dominate the space business, but many more players such as China, Iran and now North Korea, are developing their own space capabilities.\nVice Admiral Carl Mauney, deputy commander of U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees space operations, said 10 countries now had space-launch capabilities, compared to just two -- Russia and the United States -- a few years ago.\nJim Maser, president of Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, a unit of United Technologies Corp, told industry executives on Wednesday that the U.S. government lacked “an integrated, stable road map for space,” which meant industry was involved in a “kind of guessing game” as to future priorities.\n“In the absence of that, we’re placing bets, and in some cases, blind bets,” Maser said.\nMaser, whose business unit derives about 50 percent of revenue from work on human spaceflight programs, said his greatest concern was that the Obama administration would fail to make a long-term commitment to human spaceflight and provide stable funding to ensure a smooth transition from the NASA space shuttle to the successor Constellation program.\n“A prolonged period without U.S. human spaceflight would mean that we could lose that capability,” Maser told Reuters at the Space Foundation’s annual National Space Symposium.\nMORE OVERSIGHT NEEDED?\nTaxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based watchdog group, this week reported that U.S. government spending on unclassified satellites and space programs soared 42 percent to $16.9 billion in fiscal 2009, but the funding was spread across the government with no central authority to track spending.\nSpending on secret intelligence and military satellite programs is estimated to total another $13 billion more, said Micah Walter-Range, an analyst with the Space Foundation.\nBetter oversight and a transparent budget was important given the troubled history of space programs, said Taxpayers for Common Sense, noting 12 space programs had racked up cost growth of more than 200 percent in the past five years.\nMauney said U.S. Strategic Command was focused on space, advocated for new capabilities, and worked well with other agencies on operational issues, but there had been many studies on how best to coordinate space policy across the government.\n“I think it would be a good thing for this new administration to take a look at our space policies and alignment, look at the studies and then the president and the (defense) secretary can determine, along with Congress, how best to do it, Mauney told reporters at the conference.\nGiven the high cost of developing and fielding satellites, Mauney said it would be even more important in coming years for the U.S. military to collaborate with other government agencies, industry and other countries, especially on improving knowledge of what was happening in space.\nThe current oversight structure within the Pentagon splits classified intelligence programs from those focused on weather, communications, and other unclassified satellite programs.\nThat structure “inadvertently created some additional coordination steps which at times can slow things down,” Colonel Thomas Doyne, deputy director of space programs and policy for Defense Secretary Robert Gates, told Reuters.\nBut it also generated different perspectives and a more thorough understanding of programs, he said in an interview.\nCOMMERCIAL ALTERNATIVES, INNOVATION\nThe space industry is also exploring ways to innovate and respond to signals that the Pentagon will focus more on expanding the capabilities of existing systems rather than shoveling money into a spate of new development programs.\nWilliam Schuster, chief operating officer of GeoEye Inc, one of two companies that provide satellite imagery to the military, also urged the Pentagon to expand its use of cheaper commercial products.\nDavid Thompson, chief executive of Orbital Sciences Corp, said the biggest challenges facing the industry were “our own deficiencies in space architecture choices, acquisition practices and program implementation performance.”\n“If we do not shorten our space system acquisition cycles and better control their costs, other countries will inevitably narrow the substantial competitive advantages we possess today,” Thompson said.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa;

They also enjoyed regulatory leniency at home that allowed them to expand and consolidate without facing antitrust issues in Brazil.\nThe CGU is preparing to deal with cases of international bribery that might involve Brazilian companies in other countries, Simão said.\nA pact with the United States is vital even if companies are not based there because most international business is conducted in U.S. dollars and could be under U.S. jurisdiction, he added.\nMany of the companies involved in the Petrobras scandal have shares listed or bonds issued in the United States, making them subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nBrazil is striving for greater international transparency as it reels from the biggest corruption scandal in its history. Dozens of executives from top Brazilian construction and engineering firms have been arrested for allegedly paying bribes to Petrobras executives and kickbacks to politicians in President Dilma Rousseff’s governing coalition.\nThe CGU is currently negotiating leniency settlements with seven of the 29 Brazilian builders implicated in the Petrobras scandal, which would allow them to bid for future government contracts in return for admission of guilt, reparation of financial damages and payment of fines.\n“We expect to conclude most of these negotiations by the end of the year,” Simao said.\nOther companies, such as Brazil’s largest engineering firm Odebrecht SA, have so far declined to negotiate with the CGU.

{"num":105,"Time":"MAY 11, 2011","Title":"Clean Energy Investment 'Bank' Has Bipartisan Support, But No Money","Content":"By Elizabeth McGowan\n10 MIN READ\nThose championing a green investment agency are hopeful that senators will rearrange enough dollars in the DOE budget, or elsewhere, to make it happen\nBy Elizabeth McGowan, SolveClimate News\nWASHINGTON—Two top senators are again toying with the fancy of enhancing the Department of Energy’s ability to finance clean energy projects.\nThose in the business are certainly eager to embrace the resurrection of what is called the Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA).\nHowever, they’re jittery that it will emerge as a piece of “all hat and no cattle” legislation if the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee can’t definitively map out where to find an estimated $10 billion in upfront costs.\nCommittee Chairman Jeff Bingaman is talking about having a piece of legislation — likely without accommodations for offsetting the cost — prepared this month. It’s possible that the committee could mark it up and vote on it within the next few weeks.\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the committee’s ranking Republican, is on board with the New Mexico Democrat’s measure. But she’s made it clear that the program’s cost would have to be balanced via spending reductions elsewhere in the federal budget.\nExpectations are that the Senate, where the Democratic caucus has a 53-47 majority, would follow the committee’s lead and be receptive to the CEDA measure. But the Republican-dominated House is a different story.\nNumerous times this year, Bingaman has told reporters that bit-by-bit is the only practical approach to molding energy legislation that the House GOP majority will not smack down.\nInnovators affiliated with the Clean Economy Network would prefer that Congress broach a comprehensive energy package but they are well aware that the term “comprehensive” is generally shunned on Capitol Hill these days.\n“It’s a reflection of the sign of the times,” Tim Greeff, the network’s policy director, told SolveClimate News in an interview. “But that being said, a good idea is a good idea. And the Clean Energy Deployment Administration is a good idea, especially right now when there are signs the economy is recovering.”\nA Brief History\nRetired New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, a Republican and former committee chairman, actually initiated the concept of CEDA several years ago.\nBacking for a DOE-connected government entity to provide financial support through loans, loan guarantees, and other mechanisms to promote deployment of clean energy technologies also gained legs in the 111th Congress.\nFor instance, it was included in the now-maligned American Clean Energy and Security Act that Reps. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Henry Waxman of California guided through a Democratic-led House in 2009.\nCEDA also drew support from Bingaman and Murkowski as part of the overarching American Clean Energy Leadership Act. The bipartisan measure cleared the energy committee but never gained traction in the Senate.\nNuts and Bolts\nWhile this country has made promising advances with renewable energy, highly fuel-efficient and electric drive vehicles, smart grid technology and ultra-efficient lighting and appliances, Bingaman explained during a May 3 committee hearing focused on CEDA, their transition to the commercial marketplace has been frustratingly slow.\nAt the same hearing, Murkowski pointed out that CEDA would address the persistent lack of available financing. A distinct advantage, she added, is that the program would allow for more stable and consistent funding to back private lending for clean energy projects, instead of only offering one-time payments in the form of grants or tax credits.\n“Despite the high initial costs of creating a Clean Energy Deployment Administration,” Murkowski said, “I continue to believe that it’s a smarter, more efficient way for the federal government to promote clean energy technologies.”\nThose insights resonate with Greeff’s organization, which has offices in Washington and San Francisco. The educational and advocacy organization was formed in March 2009 to shape a new economy based on clean technology and innovation.\nSome of the knocks on DOE’s current one-time loan programs are that they are funded inconsistently, lack transparency and geared to only the most gargantuan projects.\nFunding via CEDA, Greeff noted, would put money into the system in an intelligent manner. It would mimic a balanced investment portfolio in that it would increase security by including more diverse energy projects from a full range of sources. Plus, he added, the proposal includes enough financial and staff resources to force a strong and healthy marriage between decision-makers with technical expertise and financial and market expertise.\n“The inability to attract capital investments can be crippling,” he said. “In our humble opinion, the government definitely has a role in financing energy projects. But we don’t need guaranteed, unlimited funding that goes on for decades.”\nWhile government funding might be the rock that programs such as CEDA are built around, he said, that just means checks and balances need to be strong enough so taxpayers aren’t left holding the bag on questionable projects.\n“Government money lessens the risk for private investors,” he continued. “It’s a way to balance riskier projects with safer ventures. Some of these projects are too risky for private investors to prop up on their own.”\nReid’s Piecemeal Plan\nOn the same day of the CEDA hearing, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters that he would be open to a piecemeal tackling of energy measures on the Senate floor before Congress breaks for its Memorial Day recess.\n“I don’t think we can jam it all together. But I think we can take them one at a time,” the Nevada Democrat told reporters on Capitol Hill about his hesitancy to advance a single large package. “Anything [Bingaman] gets out of his committee, with rare exceptions, is going to be bipartisan in nature, so I look forward to doing something energy-related. We are way behind where we should be on energy legislation.”\nThus far, in addition to CEDA, Bingaman’s list includes measures that cover energy efficiency, small modular nuclear reactors and offshore drilling safety.\nHouse Unpredictable\nEven if Reid’s bits-and-pieces approach is successful, it’s dicey to predict how and if the Senate and House would be able to see eye-to-eye on compatible energy legislation. Money for clean energy doesn’t seem to be a top-of-the-list item on the GOP side of the House.\nAfter all, it was just last week that four prominent House Republicans launched what they christened HEAT. The House Energy Action Team is tasked with promoting what they call common-sense energy solutions.\n“The restrictive policies of this administration are bringing unnecessary pain at the pump and they are costing our nation jobs,” Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California said in introducing a team last Wednesday that vowed to create jobs, boost the economy and enhance security through energy independence. “The HEAT initiative will further highlight Republican energy proposals to expand domestic energy production.”\nMcCarthy is joined in this effort by three co-chairs: Chief Deputy Whip Peter Roskam of Illinois; Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan; and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings of Washington. Another 24 GOP representatives also are participating with HEAT.\nIt seems the HEAT devotees wasted no time acting.\nThe day after McCarthy made his announcement, the House gave a thumbs up to a bill (H.R. 1230) that prompts the Interior Department to pick up where it left off after the 2010 BP oil catastrophe and orchestrate oil lease sales off the coast of Virginia and in the Gulf of Mexico. This week, the House is considering amendments to a related bill (H.R. 1229) that would require the Interior Department to set solid deadlines for accepting or rejecting Gulf of Mexico drilling permits. Action is pending on a third bill (H.R. 1231) that also deals with expanding offshore drilling.\nShifting DOE Dollars?\nIn the meantime, those championing a Clean Energy Deployment Administration are hopeful that senators are courageous enough to rearrange enough dollars in the DOE budget — or elsewhere — to make the proposed entity more than a plan on paper.\nThey are certainly aware that President Obama’s budget for fiscal year 2012 is relatively generous. It would bump the Energy Department’s allotment up to $29.5 billion — 12 percent higher than the enacted budget for 2010.\nGreeff isn’t too keen on Bingaman’s notion of advancing legislation before defining a funding source but he’s trying to remain open-minded.\n“From our standpoint, this is a bottom-line industry,” he said. “Having the legislation is sort of a victory in that it’s a step forward. A framework is nice but you need to figure out where the money will come from.”\nSee Also:  Obama Taps Bingaman to Build Bipartisan Consensus for Clean Energy Standard Thwarted Bingaman Still Eyeing Clean Energy Standard in Next Congress Signs of Life in Senate for Obama's 'Clean Energy Standard'","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information because it discusses the potential establishment of the Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA) and the challenges associated with finding an estimated $10 billion in upfront costs for the program.

The small change in orientation was enough to cut all contact with the probe.\nThe signal from Voyager 2, which is now more than 12bn miles from Earth, was detected during a routine scan of the sky, Nasa said, and confirms that the spacecraft is still broadcasting and in “good health”.\nVoyager 2 is one of a pair of spacecraft that launched in 1977 to capture images of Jupiter and Saturn, but continued on a journey into interstellar space to become the farthest human-made objects from Earth.\n“We enlisted the help of the [Deep Space Network] and Radio Science groups to help to see if we could hear a signal from Voyager 2,” said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager’s project manager on Tuesday. “This was successful in that we see the ‘heartbeat’ signal from the spacecraft. So, we know the spacecraft is alive and operating. This buoyed our spirits.”\nNasa engineers working on the Voyager 2 spacecraft before its launch in 1977. Photograph: Nasa\nThe twin probes were launched within a couple of weeks of one another to explore the planets and moons of the outer solar system. Voyager 1 is still in contact with Earth and nearly 15bn miles away. In 2012, it became the first probe to enter interstellar space and is now the most distant spacecraft ever built.\nVoyager 2 hurtled into interstellar space in 2018 after discovering a new moon around Jupiter, 10 moons around Uranus and five around Neptune. It remains the only spacecraft to study all four of the solar system’s giant planets at close range.\nWhile the heartbeat signal has reassured Nasa that the probe is still working, it is not yet responding to new commands. The next hope of making contact with the spacecraft will come this week when the Canberra dish, part of Nasa’s deep space network, beams the correct command in the direction of Voyager 2 in the hope of reaching the probe’s antenna, according to the space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nThe spacecraft is so far away that even at the speed of light, software commands sent from Earth take 18 hours to reach the probe.\nSign up to First Thing\nFree daily newsletter\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If that effort comes to nothing, as engineers expect, mission controllers will have to wait until October, when the spacecraft should reset automatically and restore communications.\nThe Voyager probes have faced numerous glitches in more than 40 years in space. Voyager 1 was still on the way to Jupiter when it wrongly switched to a backup radio receiver, only to have the primary receiver burn out when engineers switched it back. After its fly-by of Saturn, Voyager 2’s camera platform got stuck because of a lack of lubricant. Much later, in 2010, the probe suffered a glitch that temporarily affected its science data.\nKeeping the probes flying became an art as much as a science after many engineers moved on to other Nasa missions, leaving a dwindling number of ageing staff familiar with the probe and its software. Though state-of-the art in the 1970s, the Voyager spacecraft have only four kilobytes of storage onboard and computing power thousands of times slower than a modern smartphone.\nThe spacecraft entered interstellar space after leaving what astronomers call the heliosphere – a protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields that are created by the sun. But neither Voyager probe has yet left the solar system. The edge of the solar system is beyond the Oort cloud where smaller cosmic bodies are still under the influence of the sun’s gravitational pull. Nasa estimates that it could take 300 years for Voyager 2 to reach the Oort cloud and perhaps 30,000 years to cross it.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information.

Seven crew members and 155 passengers were on board.\nUsing a toy airplane to demonstrate the erratic flight path, investigators said the crew lost control of the plane.\nTheir findings indicate the pilot was dealing with a repeated technical problem with the Rudder Travel Limiter (RTL), leaving the co-pilot to take control of the plane.\nElectrical interruption to the RTL happened three times in the space of 13 minutes, eventually causing the autopilot to disengage.\nWith the loss of the autopilot function, the co-pilot was left to fly the plane manually, and it was at that point that there was a miscommunication between the captain and co-pilot, investigators said.\nAccording to information gleaned from two black boxes and a cockpit recording, the pilot instructed the co-pilot to “pull down”, an order that was taken literally, sending the plane soaring up to 38,000 feet.\n“[The pilot] said, ‘Pull down, pull down.’ But when you pull down [the gear controls] the plane goes up. To make the plane go down you need to push, so this order was confusing,” said accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo.\nThe report said the plane went into a “prolonged stall condition that was beyond the capability of the crew to recover”. At one point the two men appeared to be pushing their controls in opposite directions, it added.\nThe findings from an almost year-long investigation by Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Commission are the first official explanation of what caused the Airbus to crash.\nOne recommendation made on Tuesday was for AirAsia to have a more standardised terminology to avoid such accidents from happening again.\n“To AirAsia we recommend that pilots have a standard callout or terminology to communicate so there is no misinterpretation and all pilots are trained in procedures of how to take control,” said Utomo.\nThe reason the co-pilot had initially taken control of the plane was because the captain was trying to fix a problem with the RTL, an issue that investigators revealed had occurred 23 times on that specific plane since January 2014.\nAirAsia plane’s tail recovered from Java Sea in January Guardian\nThe problem was related to a cracked solder joint caused by exposure to extreme temperatures. In the months leading up to crash the problem had been occurring more frequently on the plane, including on a flight three days earlier between Surabaya and Kuala Lumpur.\nBefore the crash, Malaysian airliner AirAsia had a sound safety record.\nThe region’s aviation safety record has been undermined by a series of fatal crashes. In June, an Indonesian military plane careered into the side of a building in Medan, Sumatra, killing more than 140 people. Since August three separate fatal plane crashes in Sulawesi and West Papua have killed 64 people. AirAsia’s chief executive, Tony Fernandes, said on Tuesday that “there is much to be learned here for AirAsia, the manufacturer and the aviation industry”.\nHe added: “We will not leave any stone unturned to make sure the industry learns from this tragic incident.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information because it discusses the AirAsia flight QZ8501 crash into the Java Sea.

They also said it could signal that the administration's support for Taiwan was not as \"rock solid\" as it has repeatedly stated.\nAn NSC spokesman said Reuters' account of the incident was \"inaccurate\".\n\"At no time did the White House direct that Minister Tang's video feed be cut,\" the spokesman said in an email, also blaming it on confusion over screen-sharing and adding that the full video could be viewed on the summit web page.\nAsked whether she believed the U.S. government cut the video due to the slide, Tang told Reuters in an email: \"No, I do not believe that this has anything to do with the CIVICUS map in my slides, or U.S. allies in Asia for that matter.\"\nTaiwan's foreign ministry blamed \"technical problems.\"\nIt later said Tang's presentation had been provided in advance and not shown at the last minute.\n\"Taiwan and the United States have fully communicated on this technical issue, and the two sides have a solid mutual trust and a solid and friendly relationship,\" it said.\nThe issue comes at a highly sensitive time for U.S.-Taiwan relations, when some Biden administration critics and foreign policy experts are calling for more overt shows of support for the island, including an end to a long-held policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" as to whether the United States would defend it militarily.\nTaiwan experts said they did not see the color-coding of the map as a violation of unofficial U.S. guidelines, which bar use of overt symbols of sovereignty, such as Taiwan's flag.\n\"It was clearly not to distinguish sovereignty, but the degree of democratic expression,\" said Douglas Paal, a former unofficial U.S. ambassador to Taiwan.\nUnder U.S. government guidelines as of 2020, U.S. government maps showing sovereignty by color require Taiwan to be shown with the same color as China, although exceptions can be made \"when context requires that Taiwan be specifically singled out.\"\nBonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund of the United States said the guidelines would not apply to a non-U.S. government map, \"but the U.S. would likely want to avoid appearing to endorse that Taiwan is not part of China.\"\n\"It seems to me that a decision was made at the outset that Taiwan could\/should be included in the Summit for Democracy, but only in ways consistent with U.S. policy.\"\nAdditional reporting by Simon Lewis in Washington and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Diane Craft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAcquire Licensing Rights\n, opens new tab\nHumeyra Pamuk\nThomson Reuters\nHumeyra Pamuk is a senior foreign policy correspondent based in Washington DC.

Fold-up maps","Content":"By Teddy Nykiel\n4 MIN READ\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - In a world of iPads, GPS and digital technology at your fingertips, one international tourism organization has discovered that few things beat the traditional fold-up map.\nA woman covers her face with a city map in reaction to the photographer, in the central Andalusian capital of Seville January 3, 2013. REUTERS\/Marcelo del Pozo\nUSE-IT, a non-profit group that traces its roots back to 1970s Denmark, is an independent maker of free and funky city guides aimed at students and other young travelers, and it’s developing a cult following.\nDesigned and written by local artists and contributors, the colorful, individual maps are now produced in 23 cities across 14 European countries, with another two dozen cities lining up to take part in coming months.\nThe guides, covered in sharp commentary and doodle-like markings, scream youth and endeavor to point users to the hidden treats of otherwise familiar cities.\n“It shows places you don’t see in the city guides you can buy,” said Olivier Bourdon, a 23-year-old exchange student from Montreal visiting Brussels with his girlfriend, Raphaelle Paquette. “When you travel, you want to see what is local.”\nAt the USE-IT office in Brussels, where maps can be picked up free of charge, Bourdon and Paquette spent 20 minutes chatting to a young volunteer who circled their map with a string of extra destinations to explore.\nThe couple, bundled up in heavy coats against the cold and wearing near-matching thick-rimmed glasses, have plans to travel throughout Europe during their exchange. Guides for cities from Vienna to Porto are scattered around the USE-IT office.\nThe maps are pre-marked with the locations of hostels, restaurants, bars and other unique attractions. On the map for Bruges, in northern Belgium, there are “places to kiss” and on the Ghent one, all of the graffiti-ed walls are marked.\nThe Brussels map includes a waffle graphic that points out a “tourist waffle” - topped with whipped cream and strawberries, and a “super tourist waffle” - topped with a mountain of ice cream, fruit, and more cream. Belgian fries are marked too.\nThe guides are written colloquially, just as a friend might speak, so the commentary leans towards the sassy. Local artists ensure each one has a flavor that reflects the vibe of the city.

If a city wants to launch a map, it is responsible for lobbying for funding. In Belgium, funding comes from the Flemish government and local city authorities.\nThe story began in Copenhagen in 1971, the organization says. Young hippies were flooding into the city, so the mayor created a pop-up hostel for wandering travelers. The hostel began offering travel information and soon enough the first USE-IT guide was published.\n“You consider the people that are using the maps friends,” said Tine Declerck, a coordinator for the group in Brussels. “You are just giving them advice.”\nThis year, USE-IT Europe received funding from the European Commission to expand its network and there are groups in at least 25 cities trying to launch USE-IT maps of their own.\nSome of the money from the Commission will be used to create a smartphone app, although USE-IT editor Marichal thinks traditional fold-up paper maps will never be obsolete.\n“Where everything is marketed or digitalized, sometimes simple things work better,” he said.\nReporting By Teddy Nykiel\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information because it discusses the use and popularity of traditional fold-up maps, particularly those produced by USE-IT, an independent maker of free city guides aimed at young travelers.

REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo\nZURICH (Reuters) -Thomas Gottstein may have acted decisively enough this week to stay as Credit Suisse chief executive, but investors are likely to require more radical action after the bank’s $4.7 billion loss from the Archegos hedge fund scandal.\nCredit Suisse shares have dropped by 25% in the space of a month, with Switzerland’s second biggest bank reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management.\nThis toxic mix has left 57-year-old Swiss citizen Gottstein facing the daunting task of limiting the longer-term damage to the bank’s reputation and retaining both clients and staff.\n“It’s very disappointing what has happened in the last few months - it’s well below the standard we have expected,” one investor in Credit Suisse debt told Reuters.\nYet Gottstein’s hands will be tied until António Horta-Osório, known as AHO to some of the staff at Britain’s Lloyds where he is CEO, is installed as chairman, analysts and investors said, adding that the deeper impact is yet to be felt.\n“The full consequences from the reputational loss will only be visible over time,” Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Vontobel bank, said of the recent events.\nCredit Suisse said on Tuesday that it would take a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.71 billion) charge after Archegos “failed” to meet its margin commitments.\nThe scale of the charge, which is close to three times the investment bank’s profit last year, far eclipses the $2.3 billion rogue trader loss at rival UBS in 2011.\nSwiss banks have not been afraid to jettison their CEOs if things do not go to plan. The rogue trader affair triggered the departure of Oswald Grubel from UBS, while Gottstein’s predecessor Tidjane Thiam was ousted over a spying scandal.\nGottstein, a former investment banker and wealth manager who only took the helm a year ago, has responded quickly, replacing the head of the investment bank and the bank’s risk chief.\nThis followed his announcement that Credit Suisse’s asset management unit was to be separated from its wealth business after it was forced to shut $10 billion of funds that invested solely in bonds issued by Greensill.\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\nWAITING FOR AHO\nInvestors expect broader changes will be hard to undertake until two externally-conducted inquiries into Archegos and Greensill and the change of chairman are complete.\nUrs Rohner, who has been at the bank since 2011, is due to leave Credit Suisse at the end of April, with retail banking specialist Horta-Osório due to be elected at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting.\n“We hope that the change of chairman planned for the next AGM will allow the establishment of a new corporate culture with a more focused approach on risk management,” Ethos, a firm which advises shareholders on how to vote at AGMs, said.\nEthos has asked that the two investigations examine the board’s accountability and the results are made public.\nA source close to Credit Suisse said that were it not for were it not for the planned change of chairman change, the bank might already have embarked on significant structural changes.\nIn the interim, Credit Suisse has been combing through exposures in its brokerage prime services, another source said, and a more thorough review is expected to result in it reducing risk within the unit and its broader investment bank.\nThe more immediate concern is if clients and some of its top employees shift away following the most recent scandals.\nOne headhunter in Hong Kong said that he had received several inquiries from employees in Credit Suisse’s markets business looking to leave in the wake of the Archegos scandal.\nThe chairman of a wealth management boutique in Monaco said he saw a chance to lure some top Credit Suisse private bankers.\n“For someone like us, as a boutique, and other competitors of Credit Suisse, it’s a great opportunity to gain more market share with the ultra high net worth segment,” the wealth manager, who declined to be named, added.\nCredit Suisse declined comment on a potential loss of staff.\nChristian Meissner, who is to take charge of the investment bank following Chin’s exit, has been tasked with retaining talent and winning business in areas where Credit Suisse is doing well, such as listing special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), a source close to the Austrian banker said.\n“The mood among bankers is bad but people won’t quit just yet, they would need to find new jobs first and this gives Meissner time to show they can still be competitive and win mandates,” the source said.\nGottstein told Swiss newspaper NZZ on Tuesday that he still believed in the “one bank” model where divisions work together to serve wealthy clients, saying it “enhances” risk management.\nIf he sticks with the model, he will need to map a path to profitability, while keeping a much tighter rein on risk.\n“They’ve lost earnings and they won’t get it back until they find another way,” Jason Teh, chief investment officer at Vertum Asset Management in Sydney, said.\n($1 = 0.9336 Swiss francs)\nReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt; Writing by Rachel Armstrong; Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn, Pamela Barbaglia and Simon Jessop in London, John Revill in Zurich and Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong; Editing by Alexander Smith\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the JSON response based on the analysis of the provided news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems caused by financial institutions and investment losses, particularly related to Credit Suisse's $4.7 billion loss from the Archegos hedge fund scandal.

I just waded across the river.\"\nWhen he reached the Romanian shore, a Ukrainian patrol spotted him.\n\"I heard shots first, then a string of insults. But I wasn't afraid. When you've spent time at the front, you know the difference between bullets fired in the air, and bullets fired at you.\"\nGeorge is a big man with a soft face and a wounded look. As a deserter from the Ukrainian army, he would face 10 years in jail if he were caught.\nGeorge is not his real name. His and the names of other Ukrainians in this piece have been changed to protect their identities.\nHis first night in the trenches was the worst. That was in March last year, a month after the war started.\n\"We had 27 dead and 57 injured.\" He flicks through images on his phone of his former comrades. His forehead crumples as he does so and his big hands shake.\n\"All these people are dead, except me and that one\" - he points to a woman in camouflage fatigues.\nIt took him several weeks and thousands of euros paid to a network of \"guides\", to cross the whole of Ukraine from the eastern war zone to this green and peaceful western border.\nEnforcing the draft in Ukraine can be difficult and corruption is recognised as a major problem by the authorities. Reliable sources in western Ukraine speak of the existence of a \"monthly rate\" - a payment made to keep someone out of the army.\nThere are also reports from the Ukrainian frontlines, of commanders asking the recruitment office to stop sending them men who don't want to or are too scared to fight. They are just a burden in battle.\nBut many men see fleeing to another country illegally as their only chance of avoiding combat.\nThe Ukrainian army stops cars and buses every dozen kilometres on the road beside the Tisa river, looking for draft dodgers. Their database, chaotic at the start of the war, is improving.\nThe Ukrainian Border Police recently reported that they are detaining up to 20 men a day. The BBC has approached the Armed Forces of Ukraine for comment on rates of desertion and draft dodging.\nBut according to the Romanian immigration authority, 6,200 Ukrainian men of military age have crossed the 600 km (373 mile) border into Romania illegally since Russia's full-scale invasion last year and been granted temporary protection.\nSome 20,000 others made it there legally, armed with exemptions - sometimes paid for, sometimes not - and chose not to return.\nAnd according to unofficial Ukrainian figures, 90 men have died on the journey to Romania - either drowned in the Tisa, or frozen to death in the mountains - in the past 15 months.\nBoth sides have problems to contend with. The stories of tens of thousands of Russians fleeing the war and mobilisation have been extensively reported.\nBut this is the story of those Ukrainians who quit or dodged the call-up.\nDima rolls back his sock to show me his right foot. It looks like a round, pink club.\nImage caption,\nDima lost all the toes on his right foot to frostbite when he fled the draft and crossed the mountains into Romania\nHe lost all his toes to frostbite, when he crossed the Maramures mountains from western Ukraine into northern Romania.

{"num":17,"Time":"APRIL 28, 2019","Title":"Map of landmines: How Brexit might help the Scottish independence quest","Content":"By Elisabeth O’Leary\n5 MIN READ\nEDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s plans to lead her nation to independence from the United Kingdom have been muddled by Brexit, but the whirlwind at the center of British politics may yet advance her cause.\nFILE PHOTO: A Scottish flag flies between British Union Jack flag and European Union flag outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, Scotland, Britain, April 24, 2019. REUTERS\/Russell Cheyne\/File Photo\nBrexit has disrupted British politics not least because, while the United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum, the populations of two of its four nations - Scotland and Northern Ireland - voted to stay.\nSince then, Britain’s government has tied itself in knots in failed attempts to win parliament’s approval for a deal to leave the EU, and it is now unclear when, how or even whether it will manage to do so.\n“The Brexit debacle has further undermined confidence in the British political system,” said Michael Keating, professor of politics at the University of Aberdeen. “But it matters in Scotland because of this alternative, the independence option.”\nIn a referendum in 2014, Scots rejected leaving their 300-year-old union with England and Wales by 55 percent to 45.\nSturgeon argues that the changed circumstances of Brexit mean Scots now deserve a fresh choice, accusing the UK of ignoring Scotland’s views on the shape of post-Brexit economic relations with the EU.\nPrime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative-led government, kept in power by Northern Ireland’s small but strongly pro-United Kingdom DUP party, says Scotland’s views have been heard.\nBut its desire for an independent trade policy after leaving the EU is far from Sturgeon’s preference of a much “softer” Brexit that would at least keep Britain in the EU single market.\nSNAP ELECTION?\nMany now see the greatest chance of Scottish independence arising if current talks between the Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party fail to reach a compromise on future relations with the EU.\nThat may prompt a snap election - which polls suggest Labour might win, but without enough votes to govern alone, giving Sturgeon’s Scottish National Party (SNP) a kingmaker role.\n“The thing that the SNP have above all to hope for is that this government falls, we get a general election, and out of that general election we get a minority government in which they hold the power that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) currently have (as kingmaker),” said John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow.\nIf Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and May reach a deal, many in Labour, as well as in Sturgeon’s SNP, want a second Brexit referendum to ratify or reject it, with an option of remaining in the EU. But the Labour leader himself has expressed only tepid backing for a second vote.\nA senior SNP source said Corbyn was maneuvering for a general election.\n“By not supporting a Brexit deal, he thinks he can force a national election, and that is a bigger prize,” the source said.\nThat outcome would also favor the SNP.\nSince 2014, support for secession has been stuck at 45 percent. But a YouGov poll on Saturday found backing at 49 percent after Sturgeon this week outlined her “Indyref2” plans.\nHowever, even under a Corbyn government, there is no sure way the SNP can “force” the UK parliament to agree a new legal vote on secession, as UK constitutional arrangements demand.\nRIPPLE EFFECTS\nThe SNP’s best bet, as it meets for conference in Edinburgh this weekend, is to drive up public support for secession. A grassroots campaign is already in the offing.\nIf, eventually, Britain were to reverse Brexit, this would call into question the formal justification for another independence vote, described as a “material change in circumstances” in the SNP’s 2016 policy program.\nSturgeon this week set out a tentative timescale for a new vote by the end of next year. But has ruled out an illegal referendum, so that, failing approval by London, the 2021 election for Scotland’s devolved parliament seems likely to become a proxy independence vote.\nThose at the conference, such as Neil Gillespie, a 53-year-old self-employed electrician, welcome the idea of staying in the EU. But he says that would not remove the need for a new secession vote, because the UK government has shown that it lacks the will or ability to accommodate Scotland’s views.\n“I have a lot of customers who voted ‘No’ in 2014 and a huge amount of them have looked at the way Scotland has been treated during Brexit and they have changed their minds,” he said.\nStopping Brexit might delay the debate over power.\n“The independence question certainly is not going to go away. But if we were to remain in the EU, we would have more time to think about it,” said Keating, adding that this might mean seeking other ways to enhance the powers of the Scottish parliament.\nKeith Brown, deputy leader of the SNP, told Reuters that the chaos in London was helping persuade Scots that independence was a much less “scary” possibility than in 2014.\nBut he said the UK was at the same time inadvertently giving important lessons on the need to seek consensus: “Like a map of landmines, May has shown us where not to step.”\nReporting by Elisabeth O’Leary; Editing by Kevin Liffey\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news article in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information because it discusses the impact of Brexit on the Scottish independence quest.

The majority of cybersecurity problems that showed up in operational testing could have been resolved in early phases of development and testing, he wrote.\n“Overall compliance with network standards continues to improve in almost every key area reflecting the continuing efforts across the (Department of Defense) to implement cybersecurity policies and procedures,” the report said.\nBut even discovery of one password could lead to rapid exploitation of a weapon systems’ networks, he said.\nKey infrastructure components, including web servers and printers, remained focus areas for surveillance and possible exploitation by adversaries, it noted.\n“Many of these fundamental problems go undiscovered until operational testing is conducted late in the acquisition cycle, or discovered during normal fielded operations,” it said.\nGilmore said his office was working with the office of the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer to increase the scope and rigor of integrated testing to catch bugs sooner.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information because it discusses cybersecurity issues related to the U.S. Defense Department and General Services Administration's efforts to secure goods and services acquired by the U.S. federal government.

{"num":51,"Time":"4 minute read\nUpdated 5:27 AM EDT, Wed July 26, 2023","Title":"A crucial system of ocean currents is heading for a collapse that ‘would affect every person on the planet’","Content":"CNN\n — \nA vital system of ocean currents could collapse within a few decades if the world continues to pump out planet-heating pollution, scientists are warning – an event that would be catastrophic for global weather and “affect every person on the planet.”\nGlobal heat in 'uncharted territory' as scientists warn 2023 could be the hottest year on record\nA new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature, found that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current – of which the Gulf Stream is a part – could collapse around the middle of the century, or even as early as 2025.\nScientists uninvolved with this study told CNN the exact tipping point for the critical system is uncertain, and that measurements of the currents have so far showed little trend or change. But they agreed these results are alarming and provide new evidence that the tipping point could occur sooner than previously thought.\nThe AMOC is a complex tangle of currents that works like a giant global conveyor belt. It transports warm water from the tropics toward the North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southwards.\nIt plays a crucial role in the climate system, helping regulate global weather patterns. Its collapse would have enormous implications, including much more extreme winters and sea level rises affecting parts of Europe and the US, and a shifting of the monsoon in the tropics.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nSee what's it like in China's 'North Pole' during record-setting winter\n02:20 - Source: CNN\nFor years, scientists have been warning of its instability as the climate crisis accelerates, threatening to upset the balance of temperature and salinity on which the strength of these currents depend.\nAs the oceans heat up and ice melts, more freshwater flows into the ocean and reduces the water’s density, making it less able to sink. When waters become too fresh, too warm or both, the conveyor belt stops.\nIt has happened before. More than 12,000 years ago, rapid glacier melt caused the AMOC to shut down, leading to huge Northern Hemisphere temperature fluctuations of 10 to 15 degrees Celsius (18 to 27 Fahrenheit) within a decade.\nA shutdown “would affect every person on the planet – it’s that big and important,” said Peter de Menocal, the president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.\nA 2019 report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that the AMOC would weaken over this century, but that its full collapse before 2100 was unlikely.\nThis new study comes to a much more alarming conclusion.\nLong-lost Greenland ice core suggests potential for disastrous sea level rise\nAs the AMOC has only been continuously monitored since 2004, the study authors looked to a much larger dataset, and one which could show how the currents behaved in a period without human-caused climate change.\n“We needed to go back in time,” said Peter Ditlevsen, a professor of climate physics at the University of Copenhagen and one of the authors of the report. The scientists analyzed sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic in an area south of Greenland over a period of 150 years between 1870 and 2020.\nThis part of the ocean is warmed by the water transported north from the tropics by the AMOC, Ditlevsen said, “so if it cools, it’s because the AMOC is weakening.” The authors then subtracted the impacts of human-caused global warming on the water temperature to understand how the currents were changing.\nVideo Ad Feedback\n'It definitely worries me': Scientists alarmed by Greenland ice melt\n02:32 - Source: CNN\nThey found “early warning signals” of critical changes in the AMOC, which led them to predict “with high confidence” that it could shut down or collapse as early as 2025 and no later than 2095. The likeliest point of collapse is somewhere between 2039 and 2070, Ditlevsen said.\n“It’s really scary,” he told CNN. “This is not something you would lightly put into papers,” he said, adding, “we’re very confident that this is a robust result.”\nDe Menocal said the study results were “both surprising and alarming.”\nIt’s been clear for a while that the AMOC will weaken in the coming decades, he told CNN. In 2021, a study found the AMOC was showing signs of instability due to climate change.\nBut until now, we haven’t had a time frame.\nDeadly extreme heat is on the rise in national parks -- a growing risk for America's great outdoors\nThe new study “provides a novel analysis that focuses on when the AMOC tipping point will occur,” de Menocal said, and the study’s prediction the collapse will occur around 2050 “is alarmingly soon given the globally disruptive impact of such an event.” Although, he added, it is important to note that there is no observational evidence yet that the AMOC is collapsing.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nExplorer's before-and-after photos show glaciers melting\n02:46 - Source: CNN\nStefan Rahmstorf, professor of physics of the oceans at the University of Potsdam in Germany, who was also not involved in the study, said the research helps bolster previous research.\n“There is still large uncertainty where the tipping point of the AMOC is, but the new study adds to the evidence that it is much closer than we thought just a few years ago,” he told CNN. “The scientific evidence now is that we can’t even rule out crossing a tipping point already in the next decade or two.”\nThe report calls for fast and effective measures to cut planet-heating pollution to zero, to reduce global temperatures and slow melting in the Arctic.\n“The key point of this study is that we don’t have much time at all to do this,” de Menocal said. “And the stakes just got higher.”\nAn iceberg floats in Flatrock Cove, Newfoundland, Canada.

China, however, views Taiwan as a breakaway province.\nIt has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification.\nWhile Chinese jets have not been flown all the way to the island, Mr Chiu warned that there was a risk of a \"misfire\".\nTaiwan's air defence zone, which it monitors for threats, extends over an area that covers the Taiwan Strait and a large swathe of the Chinese mainland. They consider jets crossing an unofficial line between China and Taiwan as an incursion.\nMr Chiu also warned China would be capable of mounting a full-scale invasion of the island by 2025.\nHe was speaking as a parliamentary committee in Taipei considered a multi-billion-dollar defence spending bill to build missiles and warships.\nAcknowledging that China already has the capacity to invade, he said such a move would get easier in coming years, though he did not elaborate.\nTaiwan broke away from the mainland as communists seized power in 1949.\nAnalysts have warned that Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and wants to deter its President Tsai Ing-wen from taking any steps in that direction.\nA number of Western allies of Taiwan have expressed concern at China's open display of military might recently.\nWhat is the 'One China' policy?\nWhat's behind the China-Taiwan divide?\nUS approves $1.8bn weapons sale to Taiwan\nHowever, US President Joe Biden said his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had agreed to abide by the \"Taiwan agreement\".\nMr Biden appeared to be referring to Washington's longstanding \"one China\" policy under which it recognises China rather than Taiwan.\nHowever, this agreement also allows Washington to maintains a \"robust unofficial\" relationship with Taiwan. The US sells arms to Taiwan as part of Washington's Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must help Taiwan defend itself.\nThe \"One China\" policy, which Mr Biden and Mr Xi are believed to have referred to, is a key cornerstone of Sino-US relations but is distinct from the One China principle, whereby China insists Taiwan is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day.\n\"I've spoken with [Mr] Xi about Taiwan. We agree ... we'll abide by the Taiwan agreement,\" said President Biden. \"We made it clear that I don't think he should be doing anything other than abiding by the agreement.\nDespite the heightened tensions, relations between China and Taiwan have not deteriorated to levels last seen in 1996 when China tried to disrupt presidential elections with missile tests and the US dispatched aircraft carriers to the region to dissuade them.\nClose to conflict? Maybe not\nAt one level you might expect Taiwan's defence minister to be sounding the alarm like this, speaking at a hearing into whether military spending should be increased.\nThe same thing happens around the world.\nHowever, he is not alone in warning that tensions between Taiwan and mainland China have been increasing quite seriously.\nThis all still seems like we are a long way from war but Chiu Kuo-cheng is also not the only person to have warned of the potential for accidental shooting at a time of high pressure.\nEvery time dozens of mainland fighter jets and bombers fly into Taiwan's air defence zone, Taipei scrambles its own aircraft. It is not hard to imagine a scenario whereby a misunderstood signal or action could lead to a deadly incident.\nThere is considerable debate amongst analysts as to whether Beijing might be building towards a move to retake Taiwan by force.\nEach time a Chinese government official or a senior party member threatens to do this it fuels fears that this could come sooner rather than later.\nAnd such threats have been coming thick and fast recently.\nThere have even been concerns that the spate of patriotic military movies being released here could be designed to soften the public up about the need for war as a national duty.\nMany people, especially those living in Taiwan, will be hoping that Xi Jinping did make commitments to Joe Biden in the way that the US president reported he did - and that a bloody cross-Strait solution is not being considered as a serious option.\nChina and Taiwan: The basics\nWhy do China and Taiwan have poor relations? China sees the self-ruled island as a part of its territory and insists it should be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary.\nHow is Taiwan governed? The island has its own constitution, democratically elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces\nWho recognises Taiwan? Only a few countries recognise Taiwan. Most recognise the Chinese government in Beijing instead. The US has no official ties with Taiwan but does have a law which requires it to provide the island with the means to defend itself\nYou might also be interested in...\nMedia caption,\nWhy is everyone fighting over the South China Sea?\nRelated Topics\nTaiwan\nJoe Biden\nMore on this story\nWhat is the 'One China' policy?\nPublished\n6 October 2021\nUS approves $1.8bn weapons sale to Taiwan\nPublished\n22 October 2020\nWhy is everyone fighting over the South China Sea?

Especially those relating to World War Two. They are open to interpretation.\nSo it is with Ben Wallace and his reference to the 1938 Munich agreement. Some have inferred from this that the defence secretary was accusing some allies of seeking to appease President Putin. Mr Wallace's advisers insist not.\nThey say he was instead suggesting it was possible the Russian leader had already decided to invade Ukraine, in the same way Hitler had already decided at Munich to occupy part of Czechoslovakia.\nIn other words, he was suggesting that all the current diplomacy may come to naught and the West should be ready for that.\nAt most, Mr Wallace was implying that some allies might be better to judge Mr Putin on his actions and not his words.\nAll of this is not to suggest there are no differences among Western leaders. Some European countries are less forthright than the United States in their predictions of a possible invasion of Ukraine.\nOthers in Europe are fearful of losing access to Russian energy and are more cautious about what sanctions to impose if it were to invade.\nThat aside, one of the striking aspects of this crisis is how Western powers have managed to remain largely united in their broad strategy of deterrence and diplomacy, regardless of differences over individual tactics and measures.\nMore than a dozen countries have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately, including Britain.\nOn Saturday, Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said advice to UK nationals in Ukraine had changed because Russia could now attack \"at no notice\".\nMr Heappey warned that the RAF would not be able to \"fly in\" and rescue those who chose to stay, comparing the situation to the evacuation of Afghanistan last summer.\nMedia caption,\nShadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper says sanctions against Russia should not be underestimated\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the \"imminent\" threat of military action justifies evacuating the US embassy in Kyiv.\nYvette Cooper, Labour's shadow home secretary, said a \"very strong and united international response\" was needed for \"this Russian belligerence\".\n\"It is immensely serious and nobody should be naive about what Russia is up to, and the scale of the troops amassing on the Ukraine border,\" she told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme.\nMs Cooper said there had to be \"extremely strong and swift and severe\" sanctions in the face of any incursion.\nRelated Topics\nRussia\nUkraine\nBen Wallace\nMore on this story\nUkraine seeks meeting with Russia within 48 hours\nPublished\n14 February 2022\nA Ukrainian city unifies against Russia's threats\nPublished\n13 February 2022\n'We don't have the option to leave Ukraine'\nPublished\n12 February 2022\nUK won’t be able to fly people out of Ukraine - minister\nPublished\n12 February 2022","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems related to maps or geographical information because it discusses the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which involves the positioning of Russian troops near the Ukraine border.

REUTERS\/Muhammad Hamed\nThe U.N. Security Council on Friday unanimously called on Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to draw up within a month options for monitoring a ceasefire in Syria. It is the second time since the Syrian civil war broke out in March 2011 that the council backed a plan for peace talks and a truce.\nThe talk about the U.N.’s role as monitor has gained urgency along with a new push for a ceasefire in Syria to take effect as early as January, in parallel to talks between the government and opposition.\nMore than a dozen major powers, including the United States, Russia and major European and Middle Eastern powers, have drawn up a road map for Syria peace talks.\nU.N. planning for truce monitoring will seek to avoid repeating the “disaster” of a mission sent to Syria in 2012, diplomats said. That operation failed because the warring parties showed no interest in halting the fighting, they said.\nUnder the light-touch mechanism under consideration, the United Nations would rely on Syrian actors - “proxies” - on the ground to report violations. This could possibly involve a small group of non-uniformed U.N. officials in Syria to carry out investigations of ceasefire violations, diplomats said.\n“There’s the idea of proxy-ism, where they were going to look at who would be credible on the ground to get information and to create a reporting mechanism from them to the U.N.,” a diplomatic source said.\nTo make the proxy approach work, major powers would need to agree on who is considered a credible Syrian actor.\n“Who is it who’s responsible for the credibility of the information?” one diplomatic source asked. “The Syrians on the ground or the U.N., which receives the information?”\nThe U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations will likely present an option to put U.N. peacekeepers on the ground. But that approach likely will be ruled out immediately, given the brutal war that has claimed more than a quarter of a million lives.\nDiplomats on the council, which would be asked to approve any monitoring plan, also say that option is impossible.\n“DISCONNECTED FROM REALITY”\nDiplomats say they want to avoid a heavy U.N. footprint in Syria. A large number of U.N. officials on the ground in Syria would require a large security detail to protect them.\n“If we have a big security contingent, all of a sudden it looks like a full-scale mission,” one diplomatic source said. “And any U.N. presence will be targeted in Syria.”\nAnother tool for aiding verification work, another diplomatic source said, could be the use of unmanned surveillance drones, a technology the U.N. has begun using in peacekeeping missions in Africa.\nThe U.N. had to suspend operations once before in Syria. After deploying some 300 unarmed “blue beret” monitors in April 2012, it was forced by August of that year to end the mission after the moderators became the target of angry crowds and gunfire.\nThe Security Council had sent in monitors after it endorsed then-U.N.-Arab League mediator Kofi Annan’s six-point peace plan for Syria calling for talks and a truce.\nAt that time, death toll estimates for the Syrian civil war were about 10,000 - a fraction of today’s estimate of at least 250,000.\n“The U.N. team that went in back then were very courageous and pushed their mandate as far as they could,” said Richard Gowan, a professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs.\nAnother U.N. peacekeeping force called UNDOF, which still monitors the Israeli-Syrian border in the Golan Heights, has repeatedly seen its blue helmets under fire and even kidnapped by militants fighting President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.\n“It is clear that the security situation in Syria will be far, far worse this time around, so Ban needs to be creative,” Gowan said. He also noted the option of surveillance drones.\nThe planned ceasefire would not apply to Islamic State, Nusra Front and other jihadist groups. That, one diplomat said, would make any truce “wildly complex” to monitor since its territory would be constantly shifting.\nAdding to the danger, the U.S., French, British and other militaries are bombing Islamic State fighters and other jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, and Russian forces are attacking a wide array of rebel fighters, many of them backed by the West.\nOne analyst said preparing ceasefire monitoring options was a pointless exercise since none of the parties actually wanted to end the fighting.\n“All the discussion at the U.N. seems to me entirely disconnected from reality,” said Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations.\nAdditional reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by David Greising and Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems related to monitoring a possible ceasefire in Syria, which involves geographical information and maps.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\nTrade in goods will grow 4.4 percent this year after a decade averaging 3.0 percent a year following the financial crisis. Last year it grew 4.7 percent - much higher than the 3.6 percent forecast in September - and a further 4.0 percent rise is expected in 2019, the WTO said.\n“However, this important progress could be quickly undermined if governments resort to restrictive trade policies, especially in a tit-for-tat process that could lead to an unmanageable escalation,” WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said in a statement. “A cycle of retaliation is the last thing the world economy needs.”\nThe United States and China have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs in recent weeks, leading to worries that Washington and Beijing may engage in an all-out trade war.\nThe WTO’s 2018 forecast puts world trade growth at the top end of previous expectations, since the organization said last September that it expected 2018 growth of 1.4 to 4.4 percent, most likely around 3.2 percent.\nThe latest forecast raises that to 3.1 to 5.5 percent based on current GDP forecasts, but “a continued escalation of trade restrictive policies could lead to a significantly lower figure,” the WTO said.\n“These forecasts do not, and I repeat, they do not factor in the possibility of a dramatic escalation of trade restrictions,” Azevedo told a news conference.\n“It is not possible to accurately map out the effects of a major escalation, but clearly they could be serious,” he said. “Poorer countries would stand to lose the most.”\nCHINA KEY TO GROWTH\nNew trade restrictions could trigger cycles of retaliation that weigh on global trade and output, but disruption could equally come from central banks raising interest rates rapidly or from geopolitical tensions, it said.\nCyber attacks were a further risk, with potentially even greater impact on trade in services than trade in goods. Trade in commercial services grew by 7.4 percent in 2017, after two years of weak or negative growth, the WTO said.\nLast year’s growth in goods trade was led by Asia, by investment spending and by higher commodity prices. China’s rebalancing away from investment and towards consumption could mean it imports fewer capital goods, putting a drag on world trade growth.\n“Less investment could also help reduce overcapacity in sensitive sectors such as steel and aluminium, thereby alleviating trade tensions,” the WTO said.\nSteel and aluminium were the targets of one of U.S. President Donald Trump’s three big tariff announcements this year, each more controversial than the one before.\nThe steel and aluminium tariffs, justified on national security grounds, came soon after a restriction on imports of solar panels and washing machines. They preceded a huge package of tariffs that Trump has proposed to punish China for its alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property.\nChina’s commerce ministry said on Thursday that Washington’s attempts at dialogue were not sincere and vowed to retaliate should Trump escalate further.\nReporting by Tom Miles, editing by Larry King\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by global trade tensions, which can have geographical and economic implications.

REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke\/File Photo\nEurope’s biggest telecoms operator has dropped Nokia as a provider of radio gear from all but one of its dozen markets in the region, according to the source and the documents - briefing notes for top Deutsche Telekom management reviewed by Reuters.\nThe documents - written by the vendor management team for internal meetings and talks with Nokia between July and November last year - also show the German group considered Nokia the worst performer among all suppliers in 5G tests and deployments.\nBut faced with the threat of restrictions on China's Huawei - its dominant supplier of network equipment - Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE has decided to give Nokia another chance to mend their relationship, according to the documents and the source.\nA briefing note for a meeting between Deutsche Telekom managers and Nokia NOKIA.HE Chairman Risto Siilasmaa in mid-November said \"assurances have been received\" from the Finnish company, without giving details.\nThe clock is ticking. Deutsche Telekom team leaders are due to present an updated strategy for sourcing network gear from vendors to the board after the Mobile World Congress, an annual telecoms industry gathering in Barcelona at the end of this month, according to the documents and the source, who was not authorized to speak to the media and so requested anonymity.\nDeutsche Telekom’s willingness to give Nokia another hearing shows the difficulties mobile companies face over pressure from the United States on its allies to ban Huawei from their 5G networks. Washington alleges Huawei’s equipment can be used by Beijing for spying - a charge the Chinese firm denies.\nWith Deutsche Telekom foreswearing new deals with Huawei, according to the documents, it is increasingly relying on the only other big telecoms supplier, Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST, which is spreading its footprint in southeastern Europe.\nThe documents also provide a window into the troubles facing Nokia, which issued a profit warning last October that sent its shares down by a third. Nokia mainly blamed setbacks in sourcing new chipsets for 5G radio transmission systems.\nIn a joint statement issued after this story was published, Deutsche Telekom and Nokia ‘noted’ its findings and highlighted the work they were undertaking to strengthen their business relationship.\n“Nokia is of strategic importance to Deutsche Telekom. It is well known that Deutsche Telekom is pursuing a multi-vendor strategy so that we are not dependent on just one supplier. This is an elementary part of our security philosophy,” said Claudia Nemat, Deutsche Telekom’s head of technology and IT.\n“In 2019 we have made many steps together with Nokia to make Deutsche Telekom’s networks evolve towards 5G readiness, including all network domains, from radio and fixed access to transport and core, and continue to do so in 2020 and onwards.”\nFederico Guillen, Nokia’s president of customer operations in EMEA and APAC, said: “We continue to work extensively with Deutsche Telekom which is one of our most significant customers, both in Europe and the U.S.”\n(Graphic: Deutsche Telekom's European Vendor Map, )\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n‘GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES’\nDeutsche Telekom once relied equally on Huawei and Nokia for radio access network equipment - antennas and base stations that account for most of the cost of a mobile network - in Germany.\nBut in 2017 Nokia was dropped entirely from that market segment when Ericsson was handed a 30% share of Deutsche Telekom’s spending on it, reports in the trade press said at the time. It was the first of several wins for Ericsson.\nThree sources with direct knowledge of the matter said Deutsche Telekom reached an advanced stage in talks late last year to keep Huawei as its dominant supplier in Germany, with 70% of the investments in upgrading to super-fast 5G networks.\nEricsson would keep its 30% share.\nDeutsche Telekom then suspended vendor talks to await the outcome of a debate in Berlin over the security of critical national networks, where senior lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative party back the U.S. call to bar Huawei.\nWere Germany and other European countries to follow Britain’s recent decision to cap Huawei’s share of network spend at 35%, Deutsche Telekom would face serious challenges, the source with direct knowledge said.\nDespite Deutsche Telekom’s desire for multiple suppliers, however, Nokia faces a battle to win back the German group’s trust, the documents show.\nIn an all-day meeting last July 11 at Deutsche Telekom’s headquarters in Bonn, Nokia’s CEO was to be told that its responsiveness and performance were still lower than those of its competitors, and that it “must step up”, according to a briefing note prepared for Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges.\nNokia’s 5G product was inferior to all other suppliers, and negotiations were complex and drawn-out for every single project, the note stated.\nPresented in bullet-point format or as slides, the notes provide high-level talking points for top bosses, but do not identify specific Nokia products or services.\nWhile they are part of the cut and thrust of negotiations between buyers and sellers, the concerns raised appear to be backed up by Deutsche Telekom’s recent dealings with Nokia.\nThe German group’s annual purchases from Nokia across Europe and the United States fell by half to 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) between 2016 and 2018, a presentation to the executive board in mid-October shows.\nLate last year, Deutsche Telekom also dropped Nokia in Croatia and Greece, the source with direct knowledge said.\nThat left Poland as the last European country where Nokia is present, in the network shared by the local units of Deutsche Telekom and France's Orange ORAN.PA, according to an undated strategic overview of the German group's vendors.\nA 5G vendor decision in Poland is pending. A spokesman for Orange, which has picked Nokia and Ericsson to build its French 5G network, said the Polish tender was still open.\nNonetheless, on Oct. 15 - nine days before Nokia’s profit warning - Deutsche Telekom’s executive board backed a recommendation from team leaders to give Nokia another chance, the source with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n“Deutsche Telekom needs Nokia as competition to Ericsson in case of geopolitical issues,” the team leaders wrote in their presentation, in perhaps an oblique reference to Huawei.\nSouth Korea's Samsung 005930.KS, a new entrant into the networks business, could only play a meaningful role in the medium term, they added.

{"num":77,"Time":"25 April 2021","Title":"Can Western brands recover from consumer backlash in China?","Content":"Can Western brands recover from consumer backlash in China?\nPublished\n25 April 2021\nShare\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nH&M has been the main target of a Chinese boycott\nBy Tim McDonald\nBBC News, Singapore\nFor many years foreign companies operating in China have faced social media-fuelled consumer backlashes, sometimes over instances of cultural insensitivity and sometimes over political controversies.\n\"Anyone who offends the Chinese people should prepare to pay the price,\" was the blunt message from China's Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying when asked recently about a number of Western companies facing a boycott after they expressed concern over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.\nH&M was the main target, but the backlash also hit Nike, Adidas and Puma - all members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), a non-profit group promoting sustainable cotton production.\nThe Swedish fashion retailer is blocked on China's major ecommerce platforms and their physical stores have vanished from some digital maps. Twenty H&M stores remain closed.\nThese companies aren't the first to face a backlash in China and almost certainly won't be the last.\nBut the price of these transgressions seems to vary dramatically. The trouble blows over quickly for some companies, but causes lasting damage for others.\nThe President of the EU chamber of Commerce in China Jeorg Wuttke said it was not uncommon for foreign companies to run afoul of Chinese sensibilities. It's a longstanding challenge, and one that has grown with China's economic importance and Europe's changing attitudes.\n\"What has changed is that public perception and public opinion on China has dramatically soured. And that, of course, increases the heat on companies on the home front,\" Mr Wuttke said.\nNike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton\nPM rules out boycott of Beijing winter Olympics\nChina TV blurs Western brands over Xinjiang cotton\nFor some retailers like H&M, it's a conundrum. Should they stick to their principles and risk of their business in China, or relent and offend their customers elsewhere?\nAt the moment, H&M sells 94.8% of its clothing elsewhere, but China's growing wealth is likely to represent a large portion of the company's growth in the coming years.\nPragmatic anger\nMr Wuttke thinks the goal appears to be to inflict short-term pain to make a political point rather than to put companies out of business.\nThe boycotts are selective and most often target companies with a high-visibility retail presence, an approach which maximises the visibility of the backlash but also minimises the impact on China's economy.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nThe retail giants had expressed concern about the alleged use of Uighur forced labour in cotton production\nIt's fairly easy for a retailer to ramp up their operations again, but the same might not be true for businesses in other sectors, such as heavy industry.\n\"If they were to punish a chemical company, or a company that produces machinery, these guys have assets on the ground. If they walk away, they will not come back,\" he said.\nCultural missteps or political statements?\nThere are a variety of ways that foreign businesses can run into trouble with Chinese consumers. Many have fallen foul of them for being culturally insensitive.\nOften these controversies blow over, and consumers come back. Balenciaga and Burberry, for example, both offended consumers with clumsy ad campaigns related to Chinese holidays.\n\"There are now a sufficient number of instances to suggest cultural missteps can be healed through thoughtful on-the-ground execution and the passage of time,\" said Michael Norris from consumer research business AgencyChina.\nEven so, both companies have run into trouble over other issues as well. And sometimes cultural missteps can also be more serious.\nItalian luxury brand Dolce & Gabbana felt the wrath of Chinese social media when it released three videos in 2018 showing a Chinese model struggling to eat Italian food including cannoli and pizza with chopsticks.\nThe ad was widely seen as racist, and it led to a backlash with several Chinese retailers pulling the brand's products.\nThe company's results since then suggest it may have had an effect, with the Asia Pacific market falling from 25% to 22% of the group's total turnover for the year ending in March 2019 (even though the company's revenues overall grew 4.9% to $1.54bn).\nThe following year, the company's wholesale and retail takings in Asia, including China and Hong Kong, were down 35%. However, the results made no mention of the boycott and the period in question includes the first three months of 2020, when China's economy was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nFoul or free throw?\nPolitics, on the other hand, presents an entirely different challenge.\nIn 2019, the US National Basketball Association suffered what its chief executive described as \"substantial\" losses after an online comment from a team executive prompted a backlash in China.\n\"Political stances or commentary can jeopardise a brand's future in China,\" said Mr Norris.\nAfter the Houston Rockets' manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, the state-run broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, said they would stop broadcasting Rockets' matches.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nThe Houston Rockets' stance on Hong Kong pro-democracy protests also angered China\nThe Chinese Basketball Association suspended co-operation with the Houston Rockets, as did Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning, and the club's sponsor in China, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.\nThe Rockets remain benched.\n\"It took the better part of an NBA season to reinstate the Houston Rockets box-score and ranking to Tencent Sports. However, to this day, Houston Rockets apparel remains unsearchable on Alibaba's e-commerce marketplaces,\" Mr Norris said.\nA Lotte of money\nKorean companies faced perhaps the fiercest opposition in 2017, when South Korea agreed to install a US missile system which Beijing said could be used to spy on China, even though it was intended to defend against North Korea.\nThe Korea Tourism Organization estimated the spat cost the country's tourism operators $6.5bn (£4.66bn) in lost revenue. Korea's cosmetics and entertainment industries took a hit too. The central bank estimated that it knocked 0.4% off the country's economic growth for the year.\nPerhaps the biggest loser was Korean conglomerate Lotte, which provided land it owned in South Korea for the missile defence system.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nThe company sold off its chain of convenience stores to a Chinese company as a result of the controversy.\nThe suffered losses of around $1.7bn in China in the 18 months after the controversy erupted, mostly from selling off its convenience stores in China at a loss, according to the Financial Times.\nThe company's confectionery, beverage, food production and department store divisions all took a hit.\nHowever, even Lotte has returned. In 2019 the company resumed work on a $2.6bn real estate project in Shenyang.\nMr Wuttke says it rarely seems to be the case that foreign businesses are excluded from China permanently. The key question seems to be how long the boycotts last.\n\"China wants the world to know about its anger. They do so. It's very painful for companies, but it blows over,\" he said.\nYou may also be interested in...\nMedia caption,\nA TV report from China's state broadcaster illustrates how the policy works in practice\nRelated Topics\nXinjiang\nRetailing\nH&M\nMore on this story\nNike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton\nPublished\n25 March 2021\nPM rules out boycott of Beijing winter Olympics\nPublished\n24 February 2021\nChina TV blurs Western brands over Xinjiang cotton\nPublished\n7 April 2021","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information as it mentions that H&M, a Swedish fashion retailer, is blocked on China's major e-commerce platforms and their physical stores have vanished from some digital maps.

{"num":86,"Time":"FEBRUARY 27, 2013","Title":"INTERVIEW-Veteran explorer stakes Russia's claim over the Arctic","Content":"By Gabriela Baczynska\n6 MIN READ\n* Battle rages over energy resources in Arctic\n* Russia to submit fresh evidence to back up claim\n* Energy firms eye big fields; green groups concerned\nMOSCOW, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Russian polar explorer Artur Chilingarov made his name in the Soviet Union with a daring rescue of an ice-bound ship, then won international fame for planting Russia’s flag under the ice cap, angering governments with rival claims over the Arctic.\nNow at the age of 73, rather than folding away his maps, he is spearheading President Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic push to secure more of the mineral-rich region.\n“We don’t want anything that belongs to anybody else, but if we prove it’s ours, give it to us,” a cigar-puffing Chilingarov told Reuters in an interview in his Moscow office dominated by a wall map of the Arctic seabed’s topography.\nOn his desk stood a 10-cm (four-inch) high replica of the titanium Russian tricolour that he planted at the North Pole during his 2007 dive.\nHuge reserves of Arctic oil and natural gas are expected to become more accessible as climate change melts the ice and technology advances.\nFor Putin, the race for the Arctic’s natural wealth is a matter of national and personal pride at the start of his six-year, third term as president, and would be a victory from which he could reap political dividends.\nCompetition is fierce, with Norway, the United States, Canada and Denmark also seeking to secure their interests in the Arctic and where international energy majors such as ConocoPhillips and Statoil hope to succeed with potentially lucrative offshore projects.\nAfter the failure of a first attempt to secure an additional 1.2 million square km (463,000 square miles) of the Arctic shelf, Russia intends to present more evidence to support its claim to the United Nations by the end of this year.\n“Our economy today is largely based on what was developed in the Arctic regions - oil, gas, diamonds, gold, apatites - from Norilsk to Chukotka, thanks to the Soviet Union’s policies of exploring and producing there,” Chilingarov said.\n“But back then we did not go into the sea. Resources are not endless and our task now is to leave future generations the same chances of economic stability as the Soviet Union left us.”\nNEW STRATEGY\nThe map on Chilingarov’s wall was the result of 30 years of work by Soviet and then Russian scientists and was central to Moscow’s first attempt in 2001 to win U.N. recognition that its Arctic shelf extends up to the North Pole.\nRussia says an underwater mountain range known as the Lomonosov Ridge, which stretches across the Arctic Sea, is part of its own Eurasian landmass.\nBut the U.N. was not convinced and asked for more research to back the claim, rejected by Canada and Denmark, which say the formation is a geographical extension of their own land.\nChilingarov said the presentation of new evidence to back up Russia’s claim was now a priority for the Kremlin.\n“This is a very important task supported by the president. The aim is to do it by the end of this year,” said the explorer. “We spare no efforts on expeditions to prove that Russia sits on Arctic resources ... We are very serious, very serious about this.”\nRussia puts its total shelf oil and gas reserves, from the Arctic to the Caspian Sea, at 100 billion tonnes of oil equivalent - enough to power the world for more than 20 years.\nA new strategy for the Arctic, approved by Putin this month, underlines the importance of tapping more energy resources in a country whose $2.1 trillion economy is overly reliant on exports of energy resources.\nOil and gas sales now account for around half of Russia’s budget revenues and commodities make up some 90 percent of Russian exports.\nThe cost of developing any new energy fields will be great.\nRussia’s flagship gas project on the Arctic shelf, the Gazprom-controlled Shtokman, is already on hold because of cost overruns after years of failed attempts to advance work at the field holding nearly 4 trillion cubic metres of gas.\nOther countries, meanwhile, are pressing their own claims. A Danish expedition last year also collected data to support its claim to a vast tract in the Arctic including the North Pole.\nRICH REWARDS\nThe rewards for the winners are potentially huge, with the U.S. Geological Survey estimating that 30 percent of the world’s undiscovered natural gas and 15 percent of oil is in the Arctic.\nSeveral companies, including Russia’s Rosneft, Norway’s Statoil and U.S.-based Exxon Mobil are already getting ready to drill in areas of melting sea ice, despite the risks, technological difficulties and costs.\nAfter Chilingarov’s North Pole dive in 2007, he was officially declared a hero of Russia, an award he added to the title of hero of the Soviet Union that he had won for the 1980s rescue operation, and his face still adorns postage stamps.\nHe is one of only four people to have been awarded both titles, and one of only two still alive.\n“This is not the end of my expedition activity, but this was the pinnacle of it,” Chilingarov said of the 2007 dive.\nThere is also an environmental challenge to face. Many environmental groups say the rush for the Arctic’s natural resources risks destroying its fragile ecosystems, already under threat from climate change, as there are no adequate impact studies or emergency plans in case of a leak.\nLast August, Greenpeace activists scaled Gazprom’s Prirazlomnaya oil rig - Russia’s first offshore oil development in the Arctic - to protest against drilling there and draw attention to the destruction of the area.\n“As a polar explorer, obviously, I am for leaving the Arctic untouched. As a politician, I understand that Russia lives on its natural resources and should go on developing them,” said Chilingarov.

{"num":89,"Time":"DECEMBER 8, 2014","Title":"China advisers recommend seven percent growth goal in 2015 as leaders meet","Content":"By Kevin Yao\n4 MIN READ\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China’s top leadership will meet on Tuesday for an annual gathering to map out economic and reform plans for the following year, and some influential advisers to the government are recommending it cuts its 2015 growth target to seven percent.\nChina looks set to miss its growth target this year for the first time since 1999, and full-year growth is likely to be the weakest in 24 years. The government last cut its annual growth target in 2012, to 7.5 percent from eight percent that it had kept for eight years.\nSources said government-run think-tanks, which are influential in the decision-making process but do not wield power themselves, are planning to recommend Beijing reduce its official GDP growth target in 2015 to seven percent, down from 7.5 percent this year.\n“President Xi (Jinping) has already hinted at the growth target when he said growth of seven percent is the highest in the world,” said a senior economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), who declined to be identified.\n“I think it should be seven percent if there are no more surprises. But it cannot be lower than seven percent, otherwise there could be employment problems and debt default problems.”\nChina’s reform-minded leaders have shown greater tolerance for slower growth, but they will have to tread carefully to avoid a sharper slowdown that could fuel job losses and debt default risks, analysts say.\nThe annual Central Economic Work Conference, which state radio said meets from Tuesday, may reiterate a prudent monetary policy, but the sources believe the underlying tone could be accommodative to ward off a sharp growth slowdown.\nEconomists expect policymakers to embark on their biggest easing campaign since the global financial crisis, forecasting a combination of more rate cuts and reductions in bank reserve requirements to encourage lending despite mounting bad loans.\nAfter months of saying major stimulus wasn’t needed, the central bank surprised markets on Nov. 21 by cutting interest rates for the first time in more than two years to shore up growth and lift some of the pressure off debt-laden companies.\nINFLATION SEEN EASING TOO\nSeveral think-tanks have also suggested the government lower its target on consumer inflation to around three percent from this year’s 3.5 percent, given falling commodity prices.\n“We recommended a growth target of around seven percent,” said Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Centre, a top government think-tank.\n“We suggested an inflation target of around three percent. On employment, we should aim for 10 million new jobs,” he said, adding that he recommended a quicker pace of reform in 2015.\nThe government may budget a deficit of nearly three percent of GDP in 2015 from this year’s 2.1 percent, to allow local governments to sell bonds independently as they scale back fund-raising via local financial vehicles, sources said.\n“We will close the back door, barring local governments from raising debt via special purpose vehicles, but we must open up the front door. We need to boost fiscal spending and expand the budget deficit as we need to stabilise growth,” said the CASS economist.\nThe meeting, which sources said would run until Thursday, is unlikely to result in any public announcement of economic targets, which are usually reserved for the opening of the national parliamentary session in early March.\nAdding to already gloomy data, analysts expect upcoming figures on investment and inflation to be similarly lacklustre, and the property market is likely to remain weak well into 2015, weighing on demand for everything from furniture and glass to cement and steel.\nReducing the growth target would be a natural reaction as Beijing moves to manage domestic expectations.\nTop leaders could discuss ways to quicken economic reforms next year, including a fiscal overhaul to deal with the root cause of local government debt, and further financial market liberalisation, the sources said.\nWriting by Pete Sweeney in SHANGHAI; Editing by Mike Collett-White\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to economic planning in China and discusses recommendations for China's 2015 growth target.

Use CNN’s lite site for low bandwidth.\nCNN\n — \nFiona ripped through Canada’s eastern seaboard at hurricane strength after making landfall in Nova Scotia on Saturday, slamming the area with fierce winds and storm surge, sapping power for hundreds of thousands and washing away or collapsing some coastal homes.\nFiona, now a post-tropical cyclone, continued to slowly weaken Saturday evening and into the night as it moved away from the coastal town of Channel-Port aux Basques, in Newfoundland and Labrador, where the storm left a trail of devastation. Some coastal homes in the area collapsed and a few toppled structures fell into the sea or were surrounded by floodwater, pictures sent from the province Saturday morning showed.\nIn Channel-Port aux Basques, houses were washed away, Mayor Brian Button said in a Facebook video Saturday. Huge waves reaching the eastern shores of Nova Scotia and southwestern Newfoundland caused “severe coastal flooding” at the town, the Canadian Hurricane Centre said Saturday night.\nAuthorities in the province declared a state of emergency for the town amid “multiple electrical fires, residential flooding and washouts” Saturday morning.\nRené Roy, editor-in-chief of Wreckhouse Press, a local news publication, described a scene of carnage in the storm: uprooted trees, at least eight nearby homes vanished in the wake of a violent storm surge, cabins floating by, a boat carried by floodwaters into the middle of a local playground.\n“I’ve lived through Hurricane Juan and that was a foggy day compared to this monster,” Roy, 50, told CNN. Hurricane Juan battered the Canadian coast as a Category 2 storm in 2003, knocking down power lines and trees and leaving behind extensive damage. “It is surreal what is happening here,” Roy added.\nA home fights against high winds caused by Fiona in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador, on Saturday, September 24. The home has since been lost at sea.\nRene Roy\/Wreckhouse Press\/AP\nIn pictures: Fiona slams Canada's Atlantic coast\n1 of 11\nPrev\nNext\nRoy told CNN he evacuated from his home and staying with a cousin on higher ground. He had no idea Saturday evening if his home is still standing and emergency personnel stopped him from driving over to check. It was unsafe to do so, they warned.\nPictures by another area resident, Terry Osmond, showed a collapsed building in Channel-Port aux Basques surrounded by seawater at the shoreline, and splintered wood and other debris were scattered across town.\n“Never in my lifetime” has there been “so much destruction … in our area,” Osmond, 62, wrote to CNN.\nA woman in town was rescued from water Saturday afternoon after her home collapsed, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. She was taken to a hospital; the extent of her injuries wasn’t immediately known, police said.\nAbout a 30-minute drive to the east, several buildings were blown apart In the coastal Newfoundland community of Burnt Islands, video posted to Facebook by Pius Scott showed. Homes – or parts of them – collapsed in heaps, and debris littered the ground and seawater.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday afternoon the government was assessing damage from the storm, but officials had already begun helping communities who were affected, including approving Nova Scotia’s request for federal assistance. The Canadian Armed Forces will also be deployed to the region to assist in damage assessment and cleanup, Trudeau said.\nWater surrounds a collapsed home in Channel-Port aux Basque, Newfoundland, on Saturday.\nDevastation is ‘breathtaking,’ mayor says\nMeanwhile, more than 400,000 customers in Atlantic Canada remained in the dark Saturday night, including more than 290,000 people without power in Nova Scotia and more than 85,000 on Prince Edward Island, according to Poweroutage.com.\nRestoring power was among officials’ biggest priorities, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said during a Saturday news conference, describing “shocking” damage across the province, including communities whose roads had been washed out, and power lines had been torn down.\nBut weather conditions were still too severe in many areas Saturday evening for crews to begin assessing and repairing damage, said Nova Scotia Power President and CEO Peter Gregg. More than 900 power technicians were on their way to the area, but with parts of the province still experiencing storm conditions, Gregg added some customers may experience power outages for several days.\nA worker clears fallen trees and downed wires from damage in Halifax on September 24, 2022.\nThe storm made landfall in the darkness of early Saturday as a powerful post-tropical cyclone in eastern Nova Scotia, between Canso and Guysborough, and crossed over the province’s Cape Breton Island. Officials in the Cape Breton area declared an emergency and asked people to shelter in place.\nSaturday night, the Cape Breton Regional Municipality said ongoing telecommunications issues posed challenges and urged residents to stay in safe shelters, as roads were filled with downed trees and power lines and were unsafe to travel on. Emergency responders were working to help residents who had been displaced, officials said.\nWest of landfall, in Nova Scotia’s capital, Halifax, an apartment complex’s roof collapsed, forcing about 100 people to leave for a shelter, Mayor Mike Savage told CNN Saturday.\n“The magnitude of this storm has been breathtaking,” Savage later said in Saturday’s news conference. “It turned out to be everything predicted.”\nOfficials in Halifax said Saturday afternoon strong winds and risks of coastal flooding remained for the rest of the day and urged residents to stay off the roads while cleanup efforts were underway.\nIn the Prince Edward Island capital of Charlottetown, police tweeted photos of damage including a home’s collapsed ceiling.\n“Conditions are like nothing we’ve ever seen,” Charlottetown police tweeted early Saturday.\nGeorgina Scott surveys the damage on her street in Halifax on Saturday, Sept. 24, 2022.\nWhat could be next\nSaturday night, Fiona was continuing to impact parts of Atlantic Canada and eastern Quebec with strong winds and damaging storm surge, but conditions were expected to improve over Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island and later over Îles-de-la-Madeleine and southwestern Newfoundland, the hurricane centre said.\n“Rough and pounding” surf continued for parts of Nova Scotia, the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and Newfoundland, and coastal flooding was still a threat for areas of eastern Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island including the Northumberland Strait, Îles-de-la-Madeleine, and southwestern Newfoundland, the centre added.\n“There may also be some coastal flooding for the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Quebec Lower North Shore,” it said.\nA downed tree is seen on a road as Fiona hits Prince Edward Island on Saturday.\nGale-force and storm-force winds were expected to continue blowing through parts of Atlantic Canada through early Sunday, the US National Hurricane Center said Saturday evening.\nSaturday morning, hurricane-force gusts were reported across parts of Maritime Canada, generally ranging from 70 to 95 mph (110 to more than 150 kph). A top gust as of midmorning was 111 mph (179 kph) in Arisaig, Nova Scotia, according to Environment Canada.\nRainfall could total up to 10 inches in some places, and significant flooding is possible, forecasters said.\nThe storm already claimed the lives of at least five people and shut off power for millions as it battered islands in the Caribbean and the Atlantic earlier this week.\nWorkers lift a downed wire to allow machinery to access fallen trees in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Saturday.\nFiona had been a Category 4 storm early Wednesday over the Atlantic after passing the Turks and Caicos and remained so until Friday afternoon, when it weakened on approach to Canada. It became post-tropical before making landfall, meaning instead of a warm core, the storm now had a cold core. It does not affect the storm’s ability to produce intense winds, rain and storm surge, it just means the storm’s interior mechanics have changed.\nFiona had the potential to become Canada’s version of Superstorm Sandy, Chris Fogarty, Canadian Hurricane Centre manager, said before Fiona hit. Sandy in 2012 affected 24 states and all of the eastern seaboard, causing an estimated $78.7 billion in damage.\nAn unofficial barometric pressure of 931.6 mb was recorded Saturday at Hart Island, which would make Fiona the lowest pressure landfalling storm on record in Canada, according to the Canadian Hurricane Centre.\nCNN’s Allison Chinchar, Hannah Sarisohn, Sharif Paget, Derek Van Dam, Haley Brink, Aya Elamroussi, Taylor Ward, Theresa Waldrop and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems caused by maps or geographical information because it reports on the devastation caused by Hurricane Fiona in Canada's Atlantic coast.

I think it is as dramatic as that,” said Bruce Campbell, director of the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) programme, which produced the report.\n“We can tweak and we solve things for a while but I am not convinced incremental adaptation is going to work,” Campbell told Reuters from Copenhagen, adding mass migration was inevitable.\nCCAFS is part of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), a global grouping of research organisations funded by governments and private money.\nAmong the countries most vulnerable were in Africa and South Asia but also parts of China and Latin America, the researchers found.\nThey looked at a series of thresholds based on predicted changes in temperature and rainfall to see which areas became even more vulnerable than now.\nPICTURE OF PERIL\nFor example, the researchers mapped the areas where the average maximum temperature will switch from under 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) to more than that level. Many crops are temperature sensitive and rice, corn, wheat yields start to fall when temperatures rise above 30 degrees Celsius.\nThe map shows large areas of Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia will be affected.\nEven a 5 percent reduction in the length of the growing period for crops can have a major impact on yields, the study found.\nLarge areas across the tropics are already vulnerable to variable rainfall. An increase in that variability will make agriculture riskier, the researchers said.\nTo complete the picture of risk, the hazard maps were then compared with global maps of drought and flood susceptibility, yields of different crops as well as poverty indicators such as child malnutrition to give a global view.\n“When you put these maps together they reveal places around the world where the arrival of stressful growing conditions could be especially disastrous,” lead author Polly Ericksen of CGIAR’s International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, said in a statement.\nFor example, there are nearly 400 million food-insecure people in large parts of South Asia and parts of sub-Saharan Africa who are highly exposed to a five percent decrease in the length of the crop-growing season, the authors say.\nNew crop varieties will help, such as drought and flood tolerant rice or corn. But some regions will need shift production elsewhere or grow something entirely different.

Legislation, from housing benefit direct to tenants to the bedroom tax, is being driven through but scant consideration has been given to data security. Changing how and where data is held, accessed and transmitted can have profound implications and could see some housing associations breach regulations.\nSecuring personal data on the wide range of tenants which housing associations provide for is vitally important to protect their identities and to protect them from harm. Current data management is often out of date and incoming legislation threatens to disrupt processes further.\nHousing associations can avoid falling foul of legislation and take the necessary steps to ensure future compliance by following a five-point action plan:\n1 Keep pace with compliance\nOrganisations need to adhere to the Data Protection Act and the Housing Act 2004 but there is no information security standard to help guide housing associations. Appointing a trained data protection officer at a senior level can help improve data privacy and the management now and into the future.\n2 Analyse the information estate\nAnalyse the data and the applications which store it to see exactly what information is accessed across the business, who accesses it, and what it is used for – whether it be personal data (criminal convictions, benefits and allowances etc) to details on property portfolios, market and rental values, and maintenance and repair databases. You need to know what it is used for and who can access it.\n3 Perform a security gap analysis\nA gap analysis provides a benchmark and determines where data security needs to be improved. This can be used to advise upon improvements to security processes and controls, from encouraging staff to observe appropriate security policies to the introduction of technical measures such as secure access and authentication. Data security is not just about bits and bytes; the gap analysis should include physical security too, such as locations from where services are provided. Are screens visible to non-users? Are new staff vetted and regularly retrained? Are security policies in place and made accessible to them?\n4 Carry out data-landscaping\nThis catalogues the data used by the organisation and seeks to determine its value should it be lost or compromised. What would the impact be if data was released to unauthorised entities, altered, misrepresented or simply made unavailable? A database of gas boiler service dates may seem trivial, but if the data is incorrect it could pose risks to health and safety. Once value is understood, data ownership should be assigned at a managerial level of responsibility.\n5 Invest in information management systems\nThis provides structure for handling data. It enables data to be created, collected, filtered, and distributed using set patterns. This in turn makes it much easier to prove that compliance regulations have been adhered to.\nMany believe it's only a matter of time before governance regimes are brought in to prevent data loss and mishandling across the housing sector, and the Information Commissioner's Office already has the powers to fine organisations up to £500,000 for the misuse of personal data on UK citizens.\nHousing associations that address data security now will avoid incurring the wrath of the regulator and remain ahead of the curve when legislative reforms arrive.\nLouise T Dunne is managing director for independent security consultancy, Auriga Consulting\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

However, an oversight group in Israel's parliament decided not to extend these emergency measures, citing privacy as a major concern. Police had used phone location information to identify and arrest individuals violating quarantine. The committee members, including Ayelet Shaked and Gabi Ashkenazi, expressed concerns about the impact on privacy, leading to the withdrawal of the bill for the time being.

Data protection law enables the data sharing in the public interest and provides the safeguards for data that the public would expect.”\nThe ICO acts as the privacy regulator, it is currently intending to fine British Airways and the hotel chain Marriott hundreds of millions of pounds for breaching rules relating to customers’ personal data.\nEarlier this month, the ICO said data protection and electronic communication laws did not stop the government, NHS or any other health professionals from sending public health messages to people by phone, text or email.\nHowever, after the emergence of the government’s potential mobile phone data monitoring plan, British privacy campaigners have raised concerns.\nThey said individuals should be alerted if their personal data was being used, there should be judicial oversight, and there must be “sunset” provisions so such activity cannot become a permanent tactic.\n“The safety and security of the public remains our primary concern,” said the ICO spokeswoman. “The ICO and our colleagues in the public sector have this at the forefront of our minds at this time and we are here to help.”\nEarlier this week it emerged that the mobile phone industry had explored the creation of a global data-sharing system that could track individuals around the world, as part of an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus.\nThe aim of the global network would be to enact “contact tracing” to identify who someone with the virus may have come into contact with.\nThe Washington Post reported last week that the US government was in talks with Facebook, Google and other tech companies and health experts about how location data from Americans’ phones could be used to fight the pandemic. The report suggested public health experts were interested in anonymous aggregate data that could help map the spread of the virus.\nThe emergency measures approved by the Israeli government last week went further, enabling authorities to track individuals suspected or confirmed to have been infected and to notify those they may have come into contact with. They also allow phones to be used to enforce strict quarantine rules.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy and location information leakage because it discusses the UK government's potential use of personal data from mobile phones to track and monitor behavior in the context of fighting the spread of coronavirus.

{"num":31,"Time":"Thu 13 Dec 2012 16.55 CET","Title":"Poor data security can cause lasting damage to your enterprise","Content":"Security is a word that we frequently hear, whether it is in an advert on the radio telling us to lock up our homes or a leaflet through the door advising us to mark our belongings. Recently, however, security has been at the forefront of conversations for businesses as a result of technology trends, most notably the cloud and bring your own device (BYOD) revolution.\nTo address the latter, the increased adoption of personal devices in the work place – or using mobile devices supplied by employers – requires businesses to think differently about how they protect information and data. Further complications arise when cloud is introduced into the equation and employees are able to access business information regardless of geographic location. Combine this with the fact that many people now use multiple devices and it's easy to see why security is a very real concern.\nWith these changes comes the need for identity and access management; increasingly important as people move between these devices and access locations. Many Europeans now have up to five devices and 300 identities across various social media and shopping portals – not only are passwords now a nightmare to remember and keep secure, as a result, businesses are at risk from information being shared across an indefinite number of devices and networks. Known as identity pollution, this phenomenon creates a breeding ground for fraudulent activity and a growing user demand to be able to use one online identity for all services.\nWe're probably all guilty of opting to use the same details for multiple platforms, shopping sites and social media profiles for personal ease; failing to consider the consequences of doing so. The problem is that if the social media site you use is compromised, hackers are able to use the same ID to buy goods from a shopping site or, even worse, obtain access to professional accounts or services leaving your employer at risk. This all happens in a matter of seconds and minutes making prevention security top priority. Take the recent LinkedIn hack for example, alone a fairly minor issue as the majority of the information is public. However, the number of users who would have been reusing the same password and details means hackers now have access to a whole plethora of sites and information you store away behind the security of a single password.\nFor employees, there is a personal risk associated with losing sensitive information but for businesses, their whole reputation is at stake. As data proliferates, mobility increases and cloud adoption continues, enterprises lack the visibility into the location and usage of sensitive information enhancing these security risks. So, what do businesses need to consider to ensure sensitive data is managed and utilised securely?\nEmployee management\nHuman error, negligence and temptation play a huge role in security violations. Having the right technologies in place is imperative, but businesses also need to ensure employees are educated to understand the risks – and implications – associated with handling sensitive data. More so, with the implementation of identity management tools, businesses can control exactly which data employees can access depending on their role and business requirements. Allowing all employees access to all information will inevitably open the door to security glitches.\nAutomation\nAn automated identity-related control across physical, virtual and cloud environments is fundamental to improving business efficiency, security, and compliance. As employees connect to networks through different devices, searching for documents and information, automated systems act quickly to understand the trustworthiness of the device, enforcing the necessary security measures. Implementation of an automated identity management system helps make IT more flexible; being quick and adaptive in response to change is a must in today's innovative, fast-paced climate.\nDiscover, classify and control\nIf 2012 is anything to go by with over 2.7 zetabytes of data created according to the IDC, the amount of sensitive information is only going to continue to grow rapidly. Businesses need to discover, classify and control this information in-use, in-motion, at-rest and at-access. Security glitches can happen at any point within a business transaction, process or otherwise, so businesses need to cover all bases. This prevent data leakage and allow better control of information.\nBusinesses need to control how users are given an identity, the protection of that identity, and the technologies supporting that protection; they cannot afford to fall behind with their security strategy and risk damaging brand reputation if sensitive data reaches the wrong hands.\nLuke Forsyth is EMEA VP Security Services for CA Technologies.\nTo get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, sign up for free membership of the Guardian Media Network.

Apple and Alphabet’s Google have proposed one system and are considering how to work with other groups that have overlapping goals and methods.\nTo date, 28 countries around the world have launched contact tracing apps, including 11 European countries, while another 11 are developing apps based on GPS or Bluetooth data, according to an analysis by law firm Linklaters.\nThe European Commission said in a statement that app use should be voluntary and not involve any type of data that pinpoints people’s location.\n“Location data is not necessary nor recommended for the purpose of contact tracing apps, as their goal is not to follow the movements of individuals or to enforce prescriptions,” the Commission document said, citing security and privacy risks.\nPrivacy rights group American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that rather than tracking where a person has gone, apps should use Bluetooth signals exchanged between phones to track encounters.\nApple and Google last week said they would help public health authorities and others develop apps for such Bluetooth-based contact tracing.

{"num":15,"Time":null,"Title":"Cybercrime: be careful what you tell your chatbot helper…","Content":"C\noncerns about the growing abilities of chatbots trained on large language models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing Chat, are making headlines. Experts warn of their ability to spread misinformation on a monumental scale, as well as the existential risk their development may pose to humanity. As if this isn’t worrying enough, a third area of concern has opened up – illustrated by Italy’s recent ban of ChatGPT on privacy grounds.\nThe Italian data regulator has voiced concerns over the model used by ChatGPT owner OpenAI and announced it would investigate whether the firm had broken strict European data protection laws.\nChatbots can be useful for work and personal tasks, but they collect vast amounts of data. AI also poses multiple security risks, including the ability to help criminals perform more convincing and effective cyber-attacks.\nAre Chatbots a larger privacy concern than search engines?\nMost people are aware of the privacy risks posed by search engines such as Google, but experts think chatbots could be even more data-hungry. Their conversational nature can catch people off guard and encourage them to give away more information than they would have entered into a search engine. “The human-like style can be disarming to users,” warns Ali Vaziri, a legal director in the data and privacy team at law firm Lewis Silkin.\nEach time you ask an AI chatbot for help, micro-calculations feed the algorithm to profile individuals\nChatbots typically collect text, voice and device information as well as data that can reveal your location, such as your IP address. Like search engines, chatbots gather data such as social media activity, which can be linked to your email address and phone number, says Dr Lucian Tipi, associate dean at Birmingham City University. “As data processing gets better, so does the need for more information and anything from the web becomes fair game.”\nWhile the firms behind the chatbots say your data is required to help improve services, it can also be used for targeted advertising. Each time you ask an AI chatbot for help, micro-calculations feed the algorithm to profile individuals, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at the software firm ESET. “These identifiers are analysed and could be used to target us with adverts.”\nThis is already starting to happen. Microsoft has announced that it is exploring the idea of bringing ads to Bing Chat. It also recently emerged that Microsoft staff can read users’ chatbot conversations and the US company has updated its privacy policy to reflect this.\nChatGPT’s privacy policy “does not appear to open the door for commercial exploitation of personal data”, says Ron Moscona, a partner at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney. The policy “promises to protect people’s data” and not to share it with third parties, he says.\nHowever, while Google also pledges not to share information with third parties, the tech firm’s wider privacy policy allows it to use data for serving targeted advertising to users.\nHow can you use chatbots privately and securely?\nIt’s difficult to use chatbots privately and securely, but there are ways to limit the amount of data they collect. It’s a good idea, for instance, to use a VPN such as ExpressVPN or NordVPN to mask your IP address.\nAt this stage, the technology is too new and unrefined to be sure it is private and secure, says Will Richmond-Coggan, a data, privacy and AI specialist at the law firm Freeths. He says “considerable care” should be taken before sharing any data – especially if the information is sensitive or business-related.\nThe nature of a chatbot means that it will always reveal information about the user, regardless of how the service is used, says Moscona. “Even if you use a chatbot through an anonymous account or a VPN, the content you provide over time could reveal enough information to be identified or tracked down.”\nBut the tech firms championing their chatbot products say you can use them safely. Microsoft says its Bing Chat is “thoughtful about how it uses your data” to provide a good experience and “retain the policies and protections from traditional search in Bing”.\nMicrosoft protects privacy through technology such as encryption and only stores and retains information for as long as is necessary. Microsoft also offers control over your search data via the Microsoft privacy dashboard.\nChatGPT creator OpenAI says it has trained the model to refuse inappropriate requests. “We use our moderation tools to warn or block certain types of unsafe and sensitive content,” a spokesperson adds.\nWhat about using chatbots to help with work tasks?\nChatbots can be useful at work, but experts advise you proceed with caution to avoid sharing too much and falling foul of regulations such as the EU update to general data protection regulation (GDPR). It is with this in mind that companies including JP Morgan and Amazon have banned or restricted staff use of ChatGPT.\nThe risk is so big that the developers themselves advise against their use. “We are not able to delete specific prompts from your history,” ChatGPT’s FAQs state. “Please don’t share any sensitive information in your conversations.”\nGenerating emails in various languages will be simple. Telltale signs of fraud such as bad grammar will be less obvious\nUsing free chatbot tools for business purposes “may be unwise”, says Moscona. “The free version of ChatGPT does not give clear and unambiguous guarantees as to how it will protect the security of chats, or the confidentiality of the input and output generated by the chatbot. Although the terms of use acknowledge the user’s ownership and the privacy policy promises to protect personal information, they are vague about information security.”\nMicrosoft says Bing can help with work tasks but “we would not recommend feeding company confidential information into any consumer service”.\nIf you have to use one, experts advise caution. “Follow your company’s security policies, and never share sensitive or confidential information,” says Nik Nicholas, CEO of data consultancy firm Covelent.\nMicrosoft offers a product called Copilot for business use, which takes on the company’s more stringent security, compliance and privacy policies for its enterprise product Microsoft 365.\nHow can I spot malware, emails or other malicious content generated by bad actors or AI?\nAs chatbots become embedded in the internet and social media, the chances of becoming a victim of malware or malicious emails will increase. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned about the risks of AI chatbots, saying the technology that powers them could be used in cyber-attacks.\nExperts say ChatGPT and its competitors have the potential to enable bad actors to construct more sophisticated phishing email operations. For instance, generating emails in various languages will be simple – so telltale signs of fraudulent messages such as bad grammar and spelling will be less obvious.\nWith this in mind, experts advise more vigilance than ever over clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. As usual, Nicholas advises, use security software and keep it updated to protect against malware.\nThe language may be impeccable, but chatbot content can often contain factual errors or out-of-date information – and this could be a sign of a non-human sender. It can also have a bland, formulaic writing style – but this may aid rather than hinder the bad actor bot when it comes to passing as official communication.\nAI-enabled services are rapidly emerging and as they develop, the risks are going to get worse. Experts say the likes of ChatGPT can be used to help cybercriminals write malware, and there are concerns about sensitive information being entered into chat enabled services being leaked on the internet. Other forms of generative AI – AI able to produce content such as voice, text or images – could offer criminals the chance to create more realistic so-called deepfake videos by mimicking a bank employee asking for a password, for example.\nIronically, it’s humans who are better at spotting these types of AI-enabled threats. “The best guard against malware and bad actor AI is your own vigilance,” says Richmond-Coggan.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage.

In the fight to contain the coronavirus, Israel's internal security agency - the Shin Bet - was empowered to use covert systems to track people's movements.\nThe Middle East's cyber-superpower has made extensive use of surveillance technology to try tackle Covid-19, as countries around the world grapple with the trade-off between privacy and monitoring infection.\nCoronavirus: Israel enables emergency spy powers\nSurveillance 'price worth paying' in Covid-19 fight\nWatch: What is contact tracing?\nThe Shin Bet can access the location data of millions of mobile phone users to trace those who have been in proximity to confirmed patients. Israel credits the system, among other measures, with reducing the rate of infection.\nThe number of new cases reported each day is now down to double digits. Its death toll has also remained relatively low, currently standing at 252.\nMany shops have reopened and some school classes have started up again. It has felt like the first wave of infection is passing.\n\"It is precisely now when we need this tool... to break the chain of contagion and permit the people to go on with their lives,\" said National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat at a parliamentary oversight committee last week.\nBut the unprecedented expansion of the Shin Bet's powers has been the subject of controversy, including a Supreme Court challenge, questions over its accuracy, and accusations from doctors that it creates a distraction from testing for the coronavirus.\nThe agency, now acting as a tool of public health enforcement, is usually tasked with preventing attacks against Israelis and routinely monitors Palestinians in the occupied territories.\nCounter-terror methods\nArik Brabbing slips his surgical mask under his chin and breathes in Tel Aviv's warm air.

But I don't want to add another word about the sensitivity,\" he says, arguing that it could reveal capabilities to enemies.\nCan agents log-in to security cameras to track patients? \"No, No, No. It is against the law.\" The Shin Bet \"saved lives from terror, but it saves lives also from the corona,\" he says.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nAFP\nImage caption,\nIsrael has managed to keep its coronavirus death rate relatively low\nThe agency believes the system has located almost 4,000 individuals who later tested positive - around a quarter of the confirmed Covid-19 cases in Israel.\nHowever, concerns have been raised about whether it is picking up too many people, including those who simply pass a patient in the street. Almost 79,000 people have been sent messages based on the Shin Bet data, the government says.\nFears of abuse\nThe Israel Association of Public Health Physicians told MPs that the programme raised \"the substantial possibility of various errors\", saying that \"close contact\" meant a distance of less than 2m for more than 15 minutes.\nMr Brabbing said the system did measure the duration of contact.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nAFP\nImage caption,\nWith the lockdown eased, authorities are watching for signs of the virus' resurgence\nOthers believe mass surveillance programmes scrambled to deal with the pandemic are rife for abuse around the world. \"What scares me is that, at least for now, the norm is suddenly changing,\" says cybersecurity analyst John Scott-Railton of the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab.\n\"People who have been [quietly] doing these things which are highly questionable are suddenly saying: 'Look, we're your saviours here.'\"\nMeanwhile, police in Israel have enforced isolation orders partly drawing on the surveillance data. Since March, more than 110,000 checks have been carried out to confirm people are at home.

Israel's ministry of health told the BBC that it was continuing to use the data.

The report raises the potential for more regulatory scrutiny of connected vehicle systems, calling on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Trade Commission to “promulgate new standards that will protect the data, security and privacy of drivers.”\nMajor automakers have been rushing to equip vehicles with more sophisticated electronic safety and information systems linked to the mobile internet.\nThe Association of Global Automakers, an industry group, last November issued a set of privacy principles for vehicles, stating among other things that automakers would not disclose location data of drivers to the government without a warrant or court order; would not share personal data collected by the vehicle with third party data brokers; and would not market to consumers using identifiable personal data without their consent.\nMarkey’s report said the industry group’s guidelines “continue to raise a number of questions regarding how car manufacturers will effectively make their practices transparent to consumers.” (Reporting By Joe White; Editing by Tiffany Wu)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the news you provided in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": {\n        \"Reason\": \"The news is about problems related to data privacy.\",\n        \"Detailed_information\": [\n            \"The news discusses the spread of technology connecting vehicles to the Internet, raising concerns about data privacy.\",\n            \"It mentions that security measures to prevent hacking of vehicle electronics are inconsistent and haphazard across the auto industry.\",\n            \"The report notes that automakers are collecting and using large amounts of driving data, often without explicit consent or the ability for customers to opt out without disabling valuable features.\",\n            \"The report suggests potential regulatory scrutiny of connected vehicle systems to protect data, security, and privacy of drivers.\",\n            \"It mentions that an industry group (Association of Global Automakers) issued privacy principles for vehicles, indicating concerns related to data privacy.\",\n            \"Senator Ed Markey, a member of the Senate Commerce committee, is involved in the report and calls for new standards to protect data, security, and privacy of drivers.\",\n            \"The report highlights that car manufacturers need to make their practices transparent to consumers regarding data privacy.\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\nIn this case, the news is relevant to problems related to data privacy, specifically in the context of the auto industry's handling of data collected from vehicles and concerns about hacking and data security.","From":"reuters.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/autos-cybersecurity-idCNL1N0VJ11T20150209","query_name":"updated_file_Security_Measures_for_Location_Data.xlsx"}

{"num":59,"Time":"Fri 21 Jun 2013 00.59 CEST","Title":"The top secret rules that allow NSA to use US data without a warrant","Content":"Top secret documents submitted to the court that oversees surveillance by US intelligence agencies show the judges have signed off on broad orders which allow the NSA to make use of information \"inadvertently\" collected from domestic US communications without a warrant.\nThe Guardian is publishing in full two documents submitted to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (known as the Fisa court), signed by Attorney General Eric Holder and stamped 29 July 2009. They detail the procedures the NSA is required to follow to target \"non-US persons\" under its foreign intelligence powers and what the agency does to minimize data collected on US citizens and residents in the course of that surveillance.\nThe documents show that even under authorities governing the collection of foreign intelligence from foreign targets, US communications can still be collected, retained and used.\nThe procedures cover only part of the NSA's surveillance of domestic US communications. The bulk collection of domestic call records, as first revealed by the Guardian earlier this month, takes place under rolling court orders issued on the basis of a legal interpretation of a different authority, section 215 of the Patriot Act.\nThe Fisa court's oversight role has been referenced many times by Barack Obama and senior intelligence officials as they have sought to reassure the public about surveillance, but the procedures approved by the court have never before been publicly disclosed.\nThe top secret documents published today detail the circumstances in which data collected on US persons under the foreign intelligence authority must be destroyed, extensive steps analysts must take to try to check targets are outside the US, and reveals how US call records are used to help remove US citizens and residents from data collection.\nHowever, alongside those provisions, the Fisa court-approved policies allow the NSA to:\nKeep data that could potentially contain details of US persons for up to five years;\nRetain and make use of \"inadvertently acquired\" domestic communications if they contain usable intelligence, information on criminal activity, threat of harm to people or property, are encrypted, or are believed to contain any information relevant to cybersecurity;\nPreserve \"foreign intelligence information\" contained within attorney-client communications;\nAccess the content of communications gathered from \"U.S. based machine[s]\" or phone numbers in order to establish if targets are located in the US, for the purposes of ceasing further surveillance.\nThe broad scope of the court orders, and the nature of the procedures set out in the documents, appear to clash with assurances from President Obama and senior intelligence officials that the NSA could not access Americans' call or email information without warrants.\nThe documents also show that discretion as to who is actually targeted under the NSA's foreign surveillance powers lies directly with its own analysts, without recourse to courts or superiors – though a percentage of targeting decisions are reviewed by internal audit teams on a regular basis.\nSince the Guardian first revealed the extent of the NSA's collection of US communications, there have been repeated calls for the legal basis of the programs to be released. On Thursday, two US congressmen introduced a bill compelling the Obama administration to declassify the secret legal justifications for NSA surveillance.\nThe disclosure bill, sponsored by Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and Todd Rokita, an Indiana Republican, is a complement to one proposed in the Senate last week. It would \"increase the transparency of the Fisa Court and the state of the law in this area,\" Schiff told the Guardian. \"It would give the public a better understanding of the safeguards, as well as the scope of these programs.\"\nSection 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act (FAA), which was renewed for five years last December, is the authority under which the NSA is allowed to collect large-scale data, including foreign communications and also communications between the US and other countries, provided the target is overseas.\nFAA warrants are issued by the Fisa court for up to 12 months at a time, and authorise the collection of bulk information – some of which can include communications of US citizens, or people inside the US. To intentionally target either of those groups requires an individual warrant.\nOne-paragraph order\nOne such warrant seen by the Guardian shows that they do not contain detailed legal rulings or explanation. Instead, the one-paragraph order, signed by a Fisa court judge in 2010, declares that the procedures submitted by the attorney general on behalf of the NSA are consistent with US law and the fourth amendment.\nThose procedures state that the \"NSA determines whether a person is a non-United States person reasonably believed to be outside the United States in light of the totality of the circumstances based on the information available with respect to that person, including information concerning the communications facility or facilities used by that person\".\nIt includes information that the NSA analyst uses to make this determination – including IP addresses, statements made by the potential target, and other information in the NSA databases, which can include public information and data collected by other agencies.\nWhere the NSA has no specific information on a person's location, analysts are free to presume they are overseas, the document continues.\n\"In the absence of specific information regarding whether a target is a United States person,\" it states \"a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States or whose location is not known will be presumed to be a non-United States person unless such person can be positively identified as a United States person.\"\nIf it later appears that a target is in fact located in the US, analysts are permitted to look at the content of messages, or listen to phone calls, to establish if this is indeed the case.\nReferring to steps taken to prevent intentional collection of telephone content of those inside the US, the document states: \"NSA analysts may analyze content for indications that a foreign target has entered or intends to enter the United States. Such content analysis will be conducted according to analytic and intelligence requirements and priorities.\"\nDetails set out in the \"minimization procedures\", regularly referred to in House and Senate hearings, as well as public statements in recent weeks, also raise questions as to the extent of monitoring of US citizens and residents.\nNSA minimization procedures signed by Holder in 2009 set out that once a target is confirmed to be within the US, interception must stop immediately. However, these circumstances do not apply to large-scale data where the NSA claims it is unable to filter US communications from non-US ones.\nThe NSA is empowered to retain data for up to five years and the policy states \"communications which may be retained include electronic communications acquired because of limitations on the NSA's ability to filter communications\".\nEven if upon examination a communication is found to be domestic – entirely within the US – the NSA can appeal to its director to keep what it has found if it contains \"significant foreign intelligence information\", \"evidence of a crime\", \"technical data base information\" (such as encrypted communications), or \"information pertaining to a threat of serious harm to life or property\".\nDomestic communications containing none of the above must be destroyed. Communications in which one party was outside the US, but the other is a US-person, are permitted for retention under FAA rules.\nThe minimization procedure adds that these can be disseminated to other agencies or friendly governments if the US person is anonymised, or including the US person's identity under certain criteria.\nHolder's 'minimization procedure' says once a target is confirmed to be in the US, interception of communication must stop. Photo: Nicholas Kamm\/AFP\/Getty Images\nA separate section of the same document notes that as soon as any intercepted communications are determined to have been between someone under US criminal indictment and their attorney, surveillance must stop. However, the material collected can be retained, if it is useful, though in a segregated database:\n\"The relevant portion of the communication containing that conversation will be segregated and the National Security Division of the Department of Justice will be notified so that appropriate procedures may be established to protect such communications from review or use in any criminal prosecution, while preserving foreign intelligence information contained therein,\" the document states.\nIn practice, much of the decision-making appears to lie with NSA analysts, rather than the Fisa court or senior officials.\nA transcript of a 2008 briefing on FAA from the NSA's general counsel sets out how much discretion NSA analysts possess when it comes to the specifics of targeting, and making decisions on who they believe is a non-US person. Referring to a situation where there has been a suggestion a target is within the US.\n\"Once again, the standard here is a reasonable belief that your target is outside the United States. What does that mean when you get information that might lead you to believe the contrary? It means you can't ignore it. You can't turn a blind eye to somebody saying: 'Hey, I think so and so is in the United States.' You can't ignore that. Does it mean you have to completely turn off collection the minute you hear that? No, it means you have to do some sort of investigation: 'Is that guy right? Is my target here?\" he says.\n\"But, if everything else you have says 'no' (he talked yesterday, I saw him on TV yesterday, even, depending on the target, he was in Baghdad) you can still continue targeting but you have to keep that in mind. You can't put it aside. You have to investigate it and, once again, with that new information in mind, what is your reasonable belief about your target's location?\"\nThe broad nature of the court's oversight role, and the discretion given to NSA analysts, sheds light on responses from the administration and internet companies to the Guardian's disclosure of the PRISM program. They have stated that the content of online communications is turned over to the NSA only pursuant to a court order. But except when a US citizen is specifically targeted, the court orders used by the NSA to obtain that information as part of Prism are these general FAA orders, not individualized warrants specific to any individual.\nOnce armed with these general orders, the NSA is empowered to compel telephone and internet companies to turn over to it the communications of any individual identified by the NSA. The Fisa court plays no role in the selection of those individuals, nor does it monitor who is selected by the NSA.\nThe NSA's ability to collect and retain the communications of people in the US, even without a warrant, has fuelled congressional demands for an estimate of how many Americans have been caught up in surveillance.\nTwo US senators, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall – both members of the Senate intelligence committee – have been seeking this information since 2011, but senior White House and intelligence officials have repeatedly insisted that the agency is unable to gather such statistics.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage because it discusses the top-secret rules that allow the NSA to use US data without a warrant.

{"num":64,"Time":"25 April 2018","Title":"Reality Check: Who controls your data?","Content":"Reality Check: Who controls your data?\nPublished\n25 April 2018\nShare\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nBy Lora Jones\nBusiness Reporter, BBC News\nNew data protection rules will come into force in the UK in May.\nThe EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will change how companies and individuals collect, store and share data.\nWith the biggest change to data privacy in the UK since 1998 coming up, Reality Check explains what you need to know.\n1. What is the GDPR?\nThe GDPR will give people more control over how organisations use their personal information, or data.\nIt's a piece of EU legislation that was passed in 2016. It aims to create identical data privacy laws across all EU countries.\nUnder the new rules, companies who rely on an individual's consent to collect their data will face tougher restrictions.\nThe GDPR says that customers need to actively opt in. Companies will need to use language that is easy to understand, and tell people that they can withdraw consent at any time.\nFirms must also report any data breaches to authorities within 72 hours.\nIndividuals will be able to request information about how a company might be using their data, what data it collects, and why.\n2. Why does it matter?\nIn the UK, the GDPR will replace the Data Protection Act 1998.\nToday, we create a huge amount of data - from watches tracking calories and sleep, to apps for managing finances or messaging friends.\nSo, the GDPR was created to bring data protection rules up to date with how much data we produce, and how companies are using it.\nWith recent data breaches at companies such as Facebook, Uber and MyFitnessPal, the regulation will also give companies tougher guidelines on how they can use data.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\n3. When is it coming in?\nThe new law will apply in all EU states from 25 May 2018.\n4. Who does it apply to?\nThe GDPR will apply to all data \"controllers\" or \"processers\".\nControllers give direction on how and why personal data is processed (such as a company), while a processor carries out the action of collecting the data (such as an IT apprentice).\nThe regulation will also apply to individuals. For example, a hairdresser who collects email addresses of customers to send a newsletter to needs to comply with the new rules.\nThe GDPR will apply to anyone offering services in the EU, regardless of where it is headquartered.\n5. What does personal data mean?\nThe GDPR applies to all personal data. That means any information that could identify a living person, directly or indirectly.\nThis could include their name, location or their phone number.\nSome personal information is classed as sensitive by the GDPR, and needs more protection. That could include ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religious belief, trade union membership and more.\nFacebook to exclude billions from European privacy laws\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\n6. Can I access data about myself?\nAnyone can ask a company to confirm what personal data it has about them.\nThat person has the right to be provided with a copy of the information - as well as the reason for that company collecting their personal data and who gets to see it.\nThe company must supply this free of charge and in an accessible way, such as on email, within 30 days of the request, under the GDPR.\nIndividuals can also ask for data to be corrected, if it's not accurate.\n7. What is the right to be forgotten?\nPeople can also ask for their personal data to be deleted at any time - if it's no longer relevant. This is known as the right to be forgotten.\nThis right also applies online. Someone could ask a company that has made their personal data available online to delete it, for example.\nThose companies are obligated to inform others that the owner of the personal data has requested the right to be forgotten. The data, links to it and copies of it, must be deleted.\n8. How will the GDPR affect my business?\nCompanies with more than 250 employees must document all of the data they are processing, including why, how customers opted in, who can see the data, and a description of their security measures.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nSmaller companies might need only to document data they process on a regular basis, or data they process that is sensitive.\nGDPR: Are you ready for the EU's huge data privacy shake-up?\nSome business groups have raised concerns about the impact the new rules could have, saying many companies are unaware of the changes, and that recording this additional information will be a burden.\nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is responsible for enforcing the GDPR in the UK. It has published a 12-step guide on how businesses can get ready.\n9. Can I be fined for failing to comply?\nYes - the GDPR allows the ICO to issue fines to anyone failing to comply.\nThe ICO can issue fines of up to about £17.5m, or 4% of a company's global turnover, whichever is higher.\nFines can be issued for misusing data, data breaches, or failing to process an individual's data correctly.\n10. Will it still apply after the UK leaves the EU?\nGDPR rules will continue to apply after the UK leaves the EU.\nThe government's Data Protection Bill, means that GDPR rules will essentially be replicated in UK law.\nThe bill also adds the ability for individuals to request that social media companies delete any posts they made when they were a child, and expands the definition of personal data to include IP addresses, internet cookies - and even DNA.\nRead the ICO's full guide to the GDPR here.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions\nFollow us on Twitter\nMore on this story\nFirms 'should pay for people's data'\nPublished\n19 April 2018\nFacebook cuts off billions from privacy law\nPublished\n19 April 2018\nHow to protect your Facebook data\nPublished\n20 March 2018","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the news you provided in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": [\n        \"The news is about data privacy and protection regulations, specifically the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\",\n        \"The GDPR aims to give people more control over how organizations use their personal information.\",\n        \"It discusses the changes and impact of the GDPR in the UK, including the replacement of the Data Protection Act 1998.\",\n        \"The GDPR applies to all data controllers, processors, and individuals who handle personal data.\",\n        \"It explains what personal data means and mentions the right to access and delete personal data.\",\n        \"The news highlights that fines can be issued for misusing data and data breaches under GDPR.\",\n        \"It clarifies that GDPR rules will continue to apply even after the UK leaves the EU.\"\n    ]\n}\nThe news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage because it discusses the GDPR, which is a regulation designed to enhance data privacy and protection, including personal information such as names and location data.

Talking robots. Artificial intelligence that can scan thousands of medical images in a flash.\nThese are just some of the technologies rolled out by Asian countries including Singapore and China to contain the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 6,500 people worldwide.\nTechnology powered by artificial intelligence (AI) is helping track the outbreak, clean hospitals, deliver supplies and develop vaccines, with Asian governments encouraging universities and corporations to expedite innovations.\n“Sometimes the pace of innovation in emerging digital technologies can be held back by infrastructure, financing and bureaucratic constraints,” said Jonathan Tanner, a digital consultant at the Overseas Development Institute think tank.\n“When faced with a challenge like responding to the coronavirus outbreak, there are strong incentives to overcome these constraints quickly and put new technology to the test,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nIn Singapore, where open government data has enabled detailed mapping of the outbreak, robots are delivering meals and medication to patients. Some can also talk.\nIn China, where the virus emerged late last year, robots are disinfecting hospitals, drones are delivering medical supplies and AI is being used to sort scans to spot the infection.\nWhile in South Korea, authorities are tracking potential carriers using cell phone and satellite technology.\nIt is not surprising that these countries have pressed new technologies into use quickly, said Carolyn Bigg, a partner at law firm DLA Piper in Hong Kong who focuses on technology.\n“Countries such as Singapore and China want to be leaders in big data and analytics. They are showing how big data platforms can be mobilised quickly and transparently, and be a force for good,” she said.\n“It will lead to greater awareness of how big data can be used,” she said.\nMORE PRAGMATIC\nThe coronavirus outbreak, labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week, has led to city lockdowns, school closures, shutting of borders and cancellation of sporting and cultural events.\nBut countries have responded differently.\nThe WHO said last month that data protection regulations had delayed delivery of crucial information about the spread of the outbreak outside mainland China, while praising the approaches of the governments of China and Singapore.\nWhile data protection laws in Europe are driven by the intrinsic right to privacy, many Asian countries have “more pragmatic” legislation, even though there are robust compliance frameworks to prevent abuse of data, Bigg said.\n“Many data protection laws around the world have provisions to allow governments to bypass getting consent in certain circumstances, for say national security or public health emergencies,” she said.\nIn Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), requires anyone seeking to process someone’s data to obtain their consent. Mass tracking of people’s movements and contacts using smartphone location data violates this.\nSingapore’s Personal Data Protection Commission has relaxed its terms to allow the collection, use and disclosure of personal data without the person’s consent to carry out contact tracing and other coronavirus response measures.\n‘MASS SURVEILLANCE’\nYet other Southeast Asian countries are using personal data without protecting people’s privacy, said Emilie Pradichit, head of human rights charity Manushya Foundation in Bangkok.\nVietnam is tracking locals and foreigners through mobile apps, while Thai immigration authorities are using location data of those arriving in the country, which amounts to “mass surveillance and a serious risk to privacy,” she said.\nIn the absence of an independent data protection authority in many countries, there is a risk that some of these measures will stay in place even after the situation eases.\nAs more new technologies are introduced at this time, the dilemma of greater efficiency at the cost of reduced privacy will stay, and the coronavirus outbreak may accelerate the need for decisions about “what is and isn’t acceptable,” said Tanner.\n“A fundamental tension exists between the capacity of digital technologies to harvest data for specific purposes and the risks the use or misuse of that data can pose to individual liberty or security,” he said.\n“We need governments to ensure citizens are able to play an active role in shaping future policy frameworks that shape how we use AI, digital identity or facial recognition systems so that they can be used with legitimacy.”\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Claire Cozens.

The country also boasts an extensive network of highways, or Autobahns, on much of which no speed limit is enforced.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nRatingen lies just 70km (40 miles) from the Dutch border, and investigators say gangs from the Netherlands are the prime culprits for the attacks, which send glass flying, cause building facades to crumble and money cartridges to crack open.\nRaiders got away with nearly 20 million euros ($22.1 million) in 2021, when 392 ATM explosions were recorded, a tally that rose to 496 in 2022.

Prosecutors in Frankfurt this week charged six Dutch citizens with causing explosions, theft and property damage.\nReuters Graphics\nRatingen police are investigating a possible Dutch connection in last month's twin raid too, having identified a small vehicle that sped from the scene to a nearby Autobahn.\nOn Thursday, nearly a month after the attacks, Santander's facade remained boarded up. Deutsche Bank's sign was still damaged, and a sign asked for customers' understanding that ATMs were out of order while under repair.\nIn Germany, roughly 60% of everyday purchases are paid in cash, according to a Bundesbank study that found Germans, on average, withdrew more than 6,600 euros annually chiefly from cash machines.\nGermany is also working with officials in Belgium and France and at Europol to combat the cash machine crime wave. The partner authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nNoting that ATM raids endangered lives, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser this week urged banks to step up safety measures for ATMs.\nBoth Santander and Deutsche said they prioritised safety and were continuously improving ATM security, but banks inside Germany are reluctant to adopt blanket measures, instead advocating a case-by-case approach depending on individual security risk.\nA spokesperson for Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft, a umbrella lobby group for the nation's financial institutions, said: \"Different locations come with different risks.

It said the lockdown mode was intended for users who face “grave, targeted threats to their digital security”.\nThe news is a sign of how the proliferation of mercenary spyware, or tools that can be used by government clients to hack into any phones and remotely control them, has become a major business concern for Apple and other phone makers.\nWhile for years Apple appeared to play down the threat to its clients posed by Pegasus and other spyware, including by emphasising that such hack attacks affected relatively few users, supporters of the company’s latest move say the new function acknowledges the seriousness of the threat.\nThe protections offered by lockdown mode include blocking most message attachments, blocking incoming FaceTime calls if the user has not previously called the initiator or sent a request for a call, and blocking access to an iPhone when it is connected to a computer or accessory when locked.\nRon Deibert, the founder and head of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School, said the new setting would “definitely” make it more challenging for clients of NSO Group and other companies to successfully target individuals, and compared it to the introduction of two-factor authentication.\n“In other words, it’s introducing some security measure that reduces functionality and user experience in exchange for security. And … we hope other platforms would do something similar,” Deibert said. “We’ve seen the big tech platforms start to address the threats raised by the mercenary spyware industry. We definitely applaud and welcome that.”\nHe added that if the new setting was adopted by users, it would “completely reduce the possibility of getting inside and exploiting some flaw in applications or other bits of software” that make it possible for spyware such as Pegasus to infect a phone.\nWhen an iPhone or other handset is infected with Pegasus, the user of the spyware can in effect take over that phone, accessing messages, pictures and location. The software can even turn a phone into a remote listening device.\nApple does not disclose the number of its users subjected to Pegasus-style hacks, but its devices have been victim of highly targeted attacks in 150 countries. Pegasus is a hacking program developed and licensed to governments around the world by NSO Group, an Israeli company. It can infect phones running iOS or Android and can be delivered via “zero-click” attacks, which do not require any interaction with the phone’s owner to gain entry to the device.\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\nApple, which is suing NSO in the US, said the new mode was designed for users at risk of being targeted by some of the “most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from NSO Group and other private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware.” It described the mode – which will come with iOS 16, iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura in the autumn – as an optional measure for a “very small number of users”.\nApple is offering a reward of $2m (£1.7m) to anyone who can find a way round the new setting. It also announced it is making a $10m grant to the Dignity and Justice Fund, a funding initiative established by the Ford Foundation to help it expose and investigate targeted cyber-attacks.\nNSO has said it investigates all credible allegations of abuse against its government clients and that its spyware is only meant to be used to target serious criminals such as paedophiles and terrorists.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems related to privacy and location information leakage.

REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls\nThe suicide attacker killed at least 22 people at a concert packed with children on Monday, in Britain’s deadliest bombing for nearly 12 years. Islamic State claimed responsibility.\nIt was the latest in a series of bloody attacks by Islamists which, police say, show a clear policy of choosing “soft targets” where crowds gather in a relaxed atmosphere - in contrast with the vigilant and controlled regime at an airport or government building.\nHundreds have died in such atrocities over the last two years: at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, in the Bastille Day truck attack in Nice, at nightclubs in Florida and Istanbul, at a Berlin Christmas market and at other scenes of leisure.\nSalman Abedi, 22, found a weak spot in security by detonating his bomb outside the Manchester Arena in northern England as people were flooding out at the end of the performance by pop singer Ariana Grande.\nThat showed the importance of focusing security resources as much on when crowds leave events as when they enter, said Jeffrey Miller, senior vice president at MSA Security in New York.\nIt also points to the need to move out the security perimeter to well beyond the queue of fans waiting to enter, in order to pick up potential signs of danger, he said.\nThat would also help crowds disperse, offering less of a target for bombers. “Even though you can hurt or kill people, you wouldn’t kill the same numbers,” he told Reuters.\nMore technology, such as closed-circuit television, facial recognition software, chemical sensors, sniffer dogs and license plate surveillance would also be needed, he said.\nBritain raised its terrorism threat level to the highest and deployed soldiers at key sites. London police said they would review security arrangements for all public events and send extra armed officers to sports events.\nSome live entertainment shows in northern England were postponed out of respect for the Manchester victims.\nFEAR\nFans of Canadian singer Justin Bieber pleaded for his upcoming British tour dates to be cancelled for the safety of both fans and singer.\nChelsea, winners of the English Premier League soccer title, called off a planned victory parade in London on Sunday in light of the Manchester attack.\nOther countries tightened security. France ordered heightened security at sports and cultural events and called for closer coordination between private and public security personnel at events.\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb said security had been stepped up at the star-studded Cannes Film Festival.\n“We are taking special measures everywhere,” he told BFMTV.\nThe additional measures mean new costs that must ultimately be borne by spectators, performers, promoters or governments.\nAsked who would pick up the bill, Collomb said big sports clubs and organisers of major events could afford to pay for their own security but many smaller festivals planned over the summer could not afford it.\n“We will help them ... especially through the presence of security forces,” he said.\nParis police chief Michel Delpuech said soldiers and police would step up patrols around theatres in the French capital when shows were beginning and ending.\nStockholm police spokesman Kjell Lindgren said security at Wednesday evening’s Europa League soccer final in the city, between Manchester United and Ajax Amsterdam, had not been changed.\nBut he said extra police from other parts of Sweden had already been called in to help. British and Dutch police were also involved.\nBelgium, which has also suffered Islamist attacks, has around 1,250 soldiers guarding its streets. The patrols have cost the state about 100 million euros ($112 million) since being introduced at the start of 2015.\nNo bags are allowed at major sports events in Belgium. Soldiers and armed police are at football matches and bigger concerts.\nTAX ON TICKETS?\nNew York’s Madison Square Garden, which hosts concerts and professional hockey and basketball games, said it had increased security and heightened its police presence.\nNew York Police Department spokesman J. Peter Donald said additional heavy weapons teams would be sent to “high profile” locations in the city.\n“New Yorkers will also see ... explosive detection dogs, highly trained counter-terrorism officers, and random bag checks at transit locations, among other things,” he said in a statement.\nMary Mycka, executive director of the U.S. Stadium Managers’ Association, said some members were increasing armed security. The association groups about 500 stadiums including most of those in the National Football League, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer.\n“In general, people are tightening down on their security procedures, typically increasing their armed security presence around exterior perimeters before, during and especially after games,” Mycka said.\nNew York-based security consultant David Yorio recommended greater use of bomb-sniffing dogs. But like all security measures, that costs - as much as $40,000 just to get one animal certified.\nYorio suggested a tax on tickets. “Fifty cents added to every ticket can go a long way in terms of technology for detection and other expenses,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Daniel Trotta, Laila Kearney and Gina Cherelus in New York, Niklas Pollard in Stockholm and Philip Blenkinsop and Alastair Macdonald in Brussels; editing by Andrew Roche\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses the aftermath of the Manchester bombing and its impact on entertainment venues and security measures worldwide.

{"num":80,"Time":"10 minute read\nUpdated 8:17 PM EDT, Thu October 27, 2022","Title":"‘Our security here is a joke’: Election workers lament lack of federal spending on security ahead of crucial midterms","Content":"Washington\nCNN\n — \nMillions in federal dollars could have gone to protect election workers and improve the physical security of their offices, but in a classic tale of bureaucratic red tape, most of it remains untapped less than two weeks before the midterm elections.\nThe botched funding opportunity comes as election officials across the country have faced an unprecedented wave of violent threats stemming from conspiracy theories about the voting process. Now, things like additional lighting or security guards for some election offices may not be in place for Election Day on November 8.\n“Our security here is a joke,” said Scott McDonell, the Democratic clerk for Dane County, Wisconsin’s second largest. His office is a block from the state capitol building in Madison, where thousands of people have previously gathered to protest the 2020 election results. McDonell worries that people “could walk right in” to confront him.\nIn April, the Department of Homeland Security reviewed the security of McDonell’s office and found glaring shortcomings, including doors within the facility that visitors could pass through unchecked, according to the DHS assessment obtained by CNN. Yet, until CNN told him about it, McDonell said he was unaware of a DHS grant program that has in recent years made millions of dollars available to state and local government offices for various security and counterterrorism projects to bolster their physical security.\nInstead, Dane County plans to spend $12 million in county money to move to a more secure facility next year.\n“Everyone agrees that something has to be done,” McDonell told CNN. “A lot of it is the employees. They have to feel safe on the job.”\nBattleground vulnerabilities\nThe problem is particularly acute in battleground states, where lies about voter fraud have taken root following former President Donald Trump’s failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Just seven battleground states — Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — account for nearly 60% of all threats of physical violence that election workers have reported to a Justice Department task force.\nCNN reviewed data since 2020 from two federal grant programs run by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security worth hundreds of millions of dollars that election officials — along with a range of other state and local government agencies — are eligible to apply for to protect themselves from physical threats. In those seven battleground states, CNN identified only a handful of grant expenditures worth a combined total of a little more than $1 million that were dedicated to physical security for election officials.\nSupporters of President Donald Trump attend a 'Stop the Steal' protest outside the Wisconsin State Capitol on November 7, 2020.\nThe dataset is admittedly incomplete. Georgia officials declined to break out numbers pertaining to money spent on physical security and responded to only one public records request for funding data. Pennsylvania did not have records distinguishing between cyber and physical security outlays.\nFunding for elections can take years to implement. Some of the proposed projects for fiscal 2022 may not be ready until the 2024 election. And while last-minute security upgrades like fencing and cameras can make a difference, what is clear is that federal funding is falling far short of what election officials in battleground states say is needed.\nMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, whose family was harassed during the 2020 elections, said the blame isn’t always on the feds, and that state officials need to do a better job communicating their needs.\n“Oftentimes we see a breakdown where states will receive the funds and they won’t make it to the locals,” Benson told CNN. “And that then makes it harder for us to get the federal funding in future rounds because it doesn’t always reach where it has to reach.”\nCNN Exclusive: DHS rejects plan to protect election officials from harassment as midterms loom\nThe failure to disperse millions in funding shows how the federal government has struggled to adapt two key grant programs which have long focused on other crime-fighting issues to the physical security needs of election workers, at a time of unprecedented threats against them.\nInterviews with state and local election officials and groups representing them reveal some frustration over the process of applying for the DOJ and DHS money, which some describe as confusing and overly complicated. Others were unaware of the grant programs and lamented a lack of communication from the agencies in charge of the money.\nIn some cases, word is still getting out about the programs. One Wisconsin county election official, Meg Wartman, told CNN that she learned more about one of the federal programs this month and shared that information with municipal clerks who might need it.\nCNN requested a breakdown from DHS of election security projects through the grant program for the last three years. A DHS spokesperson responded by providing high-level spending figures for fiscal 2022 that did not distinguish between physical and cybersecurity.\nPulling money from the DMV\nTo be sure, federal money has made its way to local elections offices to pay for upgraded security, including millions of dollars administered by the Election Assistance Commission, records show. And some of the DHS grant money has been spent, according to information obtained by CNN.\nArizona’s Maricopa County, where angry mobs gathered to protest the 2020 election results, is spending some of the $148,033 in DHS funding it received this fiscal year on locks and lighting for the recorder’s office. Michigan got about $211,000 in fiscal 2020 to spend on radios and other security measures related to elections.\nAccording to the Maricopa County Elections Department's post on Twitter, two armed individuals dressed in tactical gear were on site at their Mesa ballot drop box location. No charges were filed against the individuals.\nIn Oklahoma, as a precaution election boards across the state are using DHS money to install panic button applications on their phones for summoning the police, according to Hiram Tabler, director of the Oklahoma Office of Homeland Security.\nBut in other cases, federal, state or county bureaucracy has gotten in the way, leaving states and localities to spend the money themselves.\nIn El Paso County, Colorado’s largest, Chuck Broerman oversees not only elections, but also motor vehicles and marriage certificates. Broerman, a Republican, said his office had pulled money from the DMV account to pay for tens of thousands of dollars worth of security cameras and other protections for election officials.\n“We’ve had calls where people would say that blood would be on our hands,” Broerman said when asked if he or his colleagues had received death threats.\nBroerman told CNN he was unaware of the DHS funding program, but probably wouldn’t have applied for it anyway because of El Paso’s financing structure that requires taxpayers to be reimbursed for federal grants.\nThe Philadelphia City Commission, which oversees elections in the city, is spending about $131,000 in federal money this year but that only covers fencing around the commission, according to Philadelphia City Commissioner Lisa Deeley. For the lighting and security gate that security appraisers also recommended, the commission will draw on $175,000 in state funds. Regardless of how it’s paid for, the security upgrade won’t be ready for the midterm elections.\nDeeley said violent threats were taking a toll on her colleagues across the country.\n“It’s unfair to have to work with that level of anxiety because you never know if that caller on the other line — they might be the one caller that means it,” she told CNN. “We are hoping for the best, preparing for the worst.”\nA security guard sets up a barricade in front of a designated demonstration area for supporters of President Donald Trump outside of where votes were still being counted, six days after the election on November 9, 2020 in Philadelphia\n‘Fighting ghosts of the last election’\nEver since Russian hackers probed voter registration records in multiple states in 2016, election security has often been viewed through the lens of cyber threats. State and local governments have spent many millions of dollars on cybersecurity. And while hackers remain a threat, the much more acute challenge is the surge in physical threats to election workers from people who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n'It's absolutely getting worse': Secretaries of state targeted by Trump election lies live in fear for their safety and are desperate for protection\n“We are always fighting the ghosts of the last election, so it is nearly impossible to predict where overtime might be necessary or where other physical security-related needs may arise,” Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, told Congress in August.\nConfusion about the DHS and DOJ grant programs has been key to their low uptake.\n“A lot of times they’re not even aware that this funding is available or who they need to talk to be able to get some of these funds for election security needs,” said Derek Tisler, counsel at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, a policy institute.\nNot only are state and local election officials often unaware of the funding, the process to secure the money is often arduous. Requests for federal grant money have to go through state homeland security offices, which are the go-between with DHS — an arrangement that analysts say can create bureaucratic logjams.\nA patchwork of results\nAlong with the grant programs run by DHS and DOJ, a third program run by the Election Assistance Commission also funds election security projects for state and local officials. That program, which is focused just on election security, has been more effective in delivering millions of dollars to election officials. Sources tell CNN that is largely because elections officials are more familiar with it.\nA review of public records of money allocated to battleground states from all three programs reveals a patchwork of results and suggests that the DOJ program has been least effective in distributing funds for election security.\nThe Justice Department program produced a single grant worth $241,000 in the last three years related to the physical security of elections, according to CNN’s review. The program offers states $285 million in funding this fiscal year for a range of crime-fighting issues, including election-related threats.\nBut many election officials only learned in January that the DOJ program could be used to guard against violent threats. That month, after election officials asked for clarity, the DOJ issued a memo stating that the grant program could be used to “deter, detect, and protect against threats of violence” to election officials. Still, that clarity hasn’t led to much of an increase in the use of that money. State agencies that administer the grants reported only a few requests related to election security since then across the entire country, Justice spokesperson Joshua Stueve told CNN.\nA line of early voters stretches outside the building as early voting begins for the midterm elections at the Citizens Service Center in Columbus, Georgia, U.S., October 17, 2022.\nColorado received the sole grant of $241,000 in funding through the Justice Department program, some of which was used for personal security for Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, her office said. This month, a Nebraska man was sentenced to 18 months in prison for threatening Griswold on social media.\nBut a spokesperson for Griswold’s office said the grant program is so cumbersome, the office won’t apply for more funding until “there are changes to the way the funding is approved and awarded.”\nThe DHS grant program has had a bit more success. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced in May that election security would be one of the “priority areas” for $1 billion in DHS grant money available this fiscal year. But with just weeks to go before the election, only a small portion of that money has been allocated toward physical security of election officials among the battleground states. (The application window is still open in some states.)\nIn addition to Arizona’s Maricopa County, CNN found DHS-funded projects, totaling $560,000 in Colorado in 2020, whose scope included some physical security issues for election infrastructure.\nNevada’s Clark County, home to Las Vegas, spent $291,7000 in DHS funding on physical security measures, which could include security cameras or fencing, for election facilities in fiscal 2020, according to Gail Powell, spokesperson for the Nevada Division for Emergency Management and Homeland Security.\nConnecticut has put at least $1 million DHS grant money toward election security measures each of the last three years, a portion of which went toward physical security, according to Brenda Bergeron, deputy commissioner in the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. Asked for specifics on how the money was spent, Bergeron declined to elaborate, citing security concerns.\nThe third program, run by the Election Assistance Commission and focused exclusively on election security, has been the most consistent in providing election officials with security money since 2020. Some of the $8 million in EAC grants that Michigan distributed this year could allow clerks to do things like install bullet-proof glass in election offices, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told CNN.\n“[W]hat we need the most, which is greater federal protections against things like doxing and harassment, and more funding for election security and the security of election officials, both of those things remain unattained,” Benson told CNN.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems related to security and safety of election workers, specifically the physical security of election offices.

The potential for Beijing to disrupt access by U.S. users to their information stored on Alibaba cloud is also a concern, one of the people said.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nU.S. regulators could ultimately choose to force the company to take measures to reduce the risks posed by the cloud business or prohibit Americans at home and abroad from using the service altogether. The U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba fell nearly 3% before the market open Tuesday and were last trading down just over 1%.\nFormer President Donald Trump's Commerce Department was concerned about Alibaba's cloud business, but the Biden administration launched the formal review after he took office in January, according to one of the three people and a former Trump administration official.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nAlibaba's U.S. cloud business is small, with annual revenue of less than an estimated $50 million, according to research firm Gartner Inc. But if regulators ultimately decide to block transactions between American firms and Alibaba Cloud, it would damage the bottom line one of the company's most promising businesses and deal a blow to reputation of the company as a whole.\nA Commerce Department spokesperson said the agency does not comment on the \"existence or non-existence of transaction reviews.\" The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nAlibaba declined to comment. It did flag similar concerns about operating in the U.S. in its most recent annual report, saying U.S. companies that have contracts with Alibaba \"may be prohibited from continuing to do business with us, including performing their obligations under agreements involving our...cloud services.\"\nThe probe into Alibaba's cloud business is being led by a small office within the Commerce Department known as the Office of Intelligence and Security. It was created by the Trump administration to wield broad new powers to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like China, Russia, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela.\nThe office has been particularly focused on Chinese cloud providers, one of the sources said, amid growing concern over the potential for data theft and access disruption by Beijing.\nThe Trump administration issued a warning in August, 2020 against Chinese cloud providers including Alibaba, \"to prevent U.S. citizens' most sensitive personal information and our businesses' most valuable intellectual property...from being stored and processed on cloud-based systems accessible to our foreign adversaries.\"\nCloud servers are also seen as ripe for hackers to launch cyber attacks because they can conceal the origin of the attack and offer access to a vast array of client networks.\nWhile there are scant public cases of the Chinese government compelling a tech company to turn over sensitive customer data, indictments of Chinese hackers reveal their use of cloud servers to gain access to private information.\nFor example, hackers connected to the Chinese Ministry of State Security penetrated HPE’s cloud computing service and used it as a launch pad to attack customers, plundering reams of corporate and government secrets for years in what U.S. prosecutors say was an effort to boost Chinese economic interests.\n\"PILLAR OF GROWTH\" Alibaba, the world's fourth largest cloud provider according to research firm Canalys, has about 4 million customers and describes its cloud business as its \"second pillar of growth.\" It saw a 50% rise in revenue to $9.2 billion in 2020, though the division accounts for just 8% of overall sales.\nIt has boasted business relationships with units of top U.S. companies including Ford Motor Co (F.N), IBM's (IBM.N) Red Hat, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), according to press releases.\nWhile the sweeping Trump era powers don't cover foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, U.S. regulators have previously found ways to link them to their U.S. parent companies, which can in turn be subject to restrictions.\nBefore tech tensions between the United States and China started to boil, Alibaba had big ambitions for its U.S. cloud business. In 2015, it launched a cloud computing hub in Silicon Valley, its first outside of China, with plans to compete with Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O). It later added additional data centers there and in Virginia.\nA person familiar with the matter says the company scaled back its U.S. gambit during Trump's presidency as tensions with China escalated.\nIn 2018, U.S. authorities blocked a bid by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, now Ant Group, to acquire U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) over national security concerns. But a move to put Ant Group on a trade blacklist failed and an executive order banning its mobile payment app Alipay was revoked by Biden.\nBiden, like Trump, has placed more and more restrictions on Chinese companies. Last month, the U.S. government put investment and export curbs on dozens of Chinese firms, including top drone maker DJI, accusing them of complicity in the oppression of China's Uyghur minority or helping the military.\nReporting by Alexandra Alper; Additional Reporting by Karen Freifeld, Chris Bing, and Echo Wang; Editing by Chris Sanders and Edward Tobin\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAcquire Licensing Rights\n, opens new tab","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems related to privacy leakage.

However, we really wish it didn't have to exist. No-one wants to live in a world where we need a safety app, but sadly there is a place for it,\" she said.\nWalkSafe will have a new sat-nav feature coming early next year, which will include a live map where your family and friends will be able to track your journey and chat with you in real time. For now its unique selling point is a map which allows people to plan their safest route home, by looking at recent crime data.\nMs Kaye said: \"Our app encourages people to have precautionary measures to avoid crime, rather than reactionary measures when in an unfortunate situation.\n\"We have senior ex-Metropolitan Police detectives and crime analysts comb through this data, and categorise it into areas the user would want to know about. By looking at the crime patterns, users can identify crime hotspots so they can plan safer routes.\"\nSince launching in March this year, the app has had more than 560,000 downloads.\nAt the University of Bath, researchers are trying to solve the problem of safety products which are difficult to physically activate. They are developing a women's smartwatch app called Epowar which would automatically send alerts if it senses the user is in distress - by monitoring heart rate and body motion.\nCo-founder, student E-J Roodt, said the idea came to her while jogging in a badly-lit park, and worrying about the risk of an attack.\n\"When I saw that smartwatches were being used to detect heart attacks I thought, well, maybe that technology could be applied to women's safety,\" she said.\nAlthough the sample size is small, the app uses artificial intelligence to recognise distress, and responds if a user is attacked when walking or running alone.\nMs Roodt said: \"It occurred to us that a smartwatch with this app may be a way to alert others if a woman is restrained or struggling.\n\"The key is that it would all happen automatically, and an assailant would have little or no time to prevent this - which is not always possible with conventional panic buttons, rape alarms or your mobile phone.\"\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nProsecutions\nFounder of the bSafe app for smartphones, Rich Larsen, believes his technology could help bring about prosecutions.\nIt has an emergency alarm feature which is voice-activated. It then automatically starts live-streaming video and audio to chosen contacts, and records everything that is happening.\nMr Larsen said: \"These recordings could be used in evidence in court cases - like rape - which are often hard to prove.\"\nThe features of the app are based on the experience of his daughter, Charlen, who was raped. Charlen - who's waived her right to anonymity in order to speak out on the issue - thinks if she had had bSafe, she wouldn't have had to struggle as much with the guilt and shame she felt.\nCrown Prosecution Service data for 2020 shows that of the 58,845 rapes recorded, only 2,102 were prosecuted, with 1,439 resulting in convictions.\nbSafe has also been of interest to other app companies. Mr Larsen said: \"We are currently developing a API-platform so we can easily implement these features in other apps.\"\nGovernment priority\nIn July the Home Office launched a £5 million fund to help improve the safety of women in public spaces at night. Some of the successful bids include initiatives involving technology.\nFor example, police in Bristol are using new kits to test whether drinks have been spiked in nightclubs.\nCheshire police are improving current call handling technology to provide an instant visible and reassuring response to a female calling for support.\nWest Yorkshire Combined Authority is promoting access to an online link with safety information for women on public transport, such as bus tracking, so there is no longer a need to stand alone at a bus stop.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nTechnology can also be misused by those seeking to harm or frighten people. So, for instance, the same technology that allows you to find your lost smartphone can be used by someone wanting to track or stalk someone.\nPaladin, the national anti-stalking advocacy service, says tech firms need to do more to protect victims if tech is misused.\nRachel Horman-Brown, chairwoman of the charity, said: \"Many victims are tracked and monitored through their phones or tablets by spyware.\n\"So actually stalkers don't even need to physically get a tracking device on the victim to be able to monitor them.\n\"Spyware is concerning as it can enable a stalker to switch on the camera on a victim's mobile phone, so that they can see and hear what is happening. They can also read and send text messages from the victim's phone, as well as tracking their whereabouts.\"\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nThe proliferation of tracking devices, like Apple AirTags or The Tile, which help you find your wallet, keys or luggage, has also led to an increase in fears of stalking.\n\"These small inexpensive tags can potentially make it very easy for a stalker to hide one in the victim's car or personal possessions, and then be able to track their victim's whereabouts,\" said Ms Horman-Brown.\nBigger issue\nFarah Nazeer, chief executive at Women's Aid, believes the issue of safety cannot be solved by tech alone: \"Whilst technology - such as safety apps on phones and smartwatches - can play a role in helping women feel safer on the streets, these interventions are temporary sticking plasters, which ignore the real cause of male violence against women.\n\"Women feel unsafe on our streets, not because of a lack of street lighting or safety apps, but because of the culture of sexism and misogyny, which makes violence against women and girls all too common. It must not be tolerated any longer.\n\"Far too many women continue to tell us that their experiences at the hands of violent men are belittled, disbelieved and dismissed by police and the criminal justice system - the very services that are supposed to protect us.\n\"We must focus on challenging the sexist attitudes that are deeply rooted in these services and systems, so that women can walk home feeling confident that they are safe and protected.\"\nRelated Topics\nCyber-stalking\nStalking\nSarah Everard murder\nWearable technology\nSabina Nessa death\niPhones\nMore on this story\nCCTV app aims to improve women's safety\nPublished\n7 October 2021\nStreet safety phone tips shared online\nPublished\n12 March 2021\nStalking rises during Covid pandemic - police\nPublished\n13 July 2021\nStudent 'degraded' by stalker asking for sex\nPublished\n16 November 2021\nAre we all becoming unknowing spies?\nPublished\n21 July 2021\nApple updates AirTags after stalking fears\nPublished\n4 June 2021","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems related to women's safety, which can include concerns about privacy and location information leakage.

{"num":88,"Time":"Wed 25 Mar 2020 13.00 CET","Title":"Mobile phone industry explores worldwide tracking of users","Content":"The mobile phone industry has explored the creation of a global data-sharing system that could track individuals around the world, as part of an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nThe Guardian has learned that a senior official at GSMA, an international standard-setting body for the mobile phone industry, held discussions with at least one company that is capable of tracking individuals globally through their mobile devices, and discussed the possible creation of a global data-sharing system.\nAny move to create such a global tracking system would represent a major escalation in efforts to use mobile phone location data to help stem the pandemic, and would be likely to raise concerns among privacy and security experts.\nUntil now the use of mobile phone tracking in the fight against Covid-19 has been restricted to national governments, which are either monitoring data within their borders or in discussions with mobile operators and technology companies about doing so.\nThey include the US, India, Iran, Poland, Singapore, Israel and South Korea. The British government is engaged in talks with BT, the owner of the UK mobile operator EE, about using phone location and usage data to determine the efficacy of isolation orders.\nThe concept of an international mobile tracing scheme would go further, enabling authorities to monitor movements and potentially track the spread of the disease across borders. The GSMA represents the interests of 750 mobile phone operators and vendors across the world and helps set international standards for companies.\nA person familiar with its exploratory talks said they were at an early stage and that decisions had not yet been made about whether to move ahead with the plan. The aim of such a global network would be to enact “contact tracing”, enabling authorities to use mobile location data to track who a person infected with Covid-19 may have come in contact with.\nA spokesperson for GSMA strenuously denied it was currently involved in any project to create a global tracking system. “We are not involved in a project of this nature,” the GSMA spokesperson said. However the GSMA also said it would not comment on discussions that had taken place or ideas that were being explored.\n“In this emergency situation, the GSMA and its members are doing everything they can to help the global fight against Covid-19,” Mats Granryd, the director of the GSMA, said in a statement emailed to the Guardian. “We are engaging with operators, policymakers and international organisations around the world to explore viable mobile big data and AI solutions to fight this pandemic while adhering to principles of privacy and ethics.”\nAdvocates of using mobile phone technology in medical emergencies say accurate and up-to-date information can be a vital tool.\nThe Washington Post reported last week that the US government was in active talks with Facebook, Google and other tech companies and health experts about how location data from Americans’ phones could be used to fight the pandemic. The report suggested public health experts were interested in anonymous aggregate data that could help map the spread of the virus.\nThe emergency measures approved by the Israeli government last week go further, enabling authorities to track individual people suspected or confirmed to have been infected to notify individuals who may have come into contact with them. They also allow phones to be used to enforce strict quarantine rules.\nThe proposed UK scheme would involve anonymised mobile phone data being used to monitor whether coronavirus limitation measures such as asking the public to stay at home are working. It could also be used to send health alerts. While the information provided on geographical movement would be delayed by 12 to 24 hours, British privacy campaigners have raised concerns over the scheme, calling for “radical transparency” in the way the government uses mobile data.\nOne telecommunications expert, who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, said GSMA would be capable of creating a global data-sharing network if mobile operators around the world agreed to share usage information. That data would then be used to help authorities visualise the spread of the disease, or to track individual subscribers to perform “contact tracing”, using an individual’s location to detect how the disease might spread.\nCoronavirus map: how Covid-19 cases are spreading across the world\nRead more\nDavid Kaye, a UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, said it was not necessarily a bad thing for governments to use technology as a means to help control the virus.

{"num":93,"Time":"Sun 8 Jun 2014 01.05 CEST","Title":"We're all being mined for data – but who are the real winners?","Content":"I\nt's exactly a year since Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA and GCHQ surveillance began to reach the public domain. As a result, we now know quite a lot about the ways the NSA and its overseas franchises have mastered \"big data\" technology to hoover up our metadata and monitor our clickstreams (which means, by the way, that there's no such thing as private reading any more – at least for anyone who reads online). But it turns out that all that was just for starters. One of the more recent disclosures is a PowerPoint deck about a GCHQ surveillance programme called Squeaky Dolphin, which suggests that the agencies' appetite for personal data is even more voracious and bizarre than most of us imagined.\nSqueaky Dolphin (the logo shows a cartoon dolphin armed with a can of WD40) is aimed at \"broad real-time monitoring of online activity\" – which essentially means logs of the YouTube videos you watched, the URLs you \"liked\" on Facebook and visits you made to blogs. One of the slides in the deck shows a graph of Facebook \"likes\" for web pages containing the name of Liam Fox, the former Tory defence minister who resigned under a cloud.\nWhy on earth do the security agencies think they need to try to get inside our minds like this? Are Squeaky Dolphin and programmes like it examples of pathological \"mission creep\"? Are the NSA and GCHQ doing this simply because they can – because it's technically feasible? Has big data's appetite for data become insatiable?\nBig data is the Rorschach blot of our times – an incomprehensible shape on to which we project our dreams and nightmares, hopes and fears. It's already shaping our lives and looks like determining our networked future. Huge corporations – who see it as \"the new oil\" – are already exploiting this 21st-century resource, or tooling up to grab some of the action. And governments have been exploiting it since the turn of the millennium.\nBig data is an ugly term that covers a multitude of activities. Technically, it refers to datasets that are too large and complex to manipulate or interrogate with standard methods or tools. In practice, the term encompasses a whole spectrum of interpretations: a mindset that is obsessed with quantitative information; an approach to decision-making; a new way – sometimes the only way – of doing some kinds of modern science; a computing technology that combines massive processing power with formidable storage capacity and parallel-processing algorithms; a way of detecting terrorist and criminal networks; a way of building detailed profiles of customers in order to increase the chances of selling stuff to them; and much more. For simplicity, let's call it the Next Big Thing.\nHow did we get here?\nIn the beginning there was no data. Well, nothing we would regard as data anyway. And then in the mid-17th century the word emerged as a philosophical term, as the plural of the Latin word \"datum\", which means \"that is given\" – a starting point, something on which you can start to build an argument. It came into its own only when we began to collect information in quantitative form and developed technologies and procedures for processing that information. Computing started, after all, as \"data processing\".\nFor most of human history, data was scarce, hard to collect and difficult to analyse. As industrialisation gathered pace and the nation-state evolved, vast efforts went into collecting the quantitative information needed to administer a modern democracy. It started with censuses and grew from there. But because we had no technologies for analysing the resulting data harvests in their entirety, we used mathematical tools for summarising their essential features. We called the academic discipline \"statistics\" and used its fundamental concepts – means, medians, probability distributions, sampling, significance tests, bias etc – as ways of extracting meaning from data. These tools were useful in many ways, but they dealt only in aggregates and told us little about individuals, any one of whom could – as the old classroom adage put it – \"drown in a river that was on average only six inches deep\".\nAnd that was how things stood for the best part of a century. What triggered the seismic shift in our information environment was the advent of the internet in the 1980s, and more particularly, the arrival of the web in the 1990s and the mobile phone revolution shortly afterwards. From then on, data went from being scarce and expensive to collect to being bountiful and cheap to harvest (and store) – provided you had the necessary equipment and were in the right place in the ecosystem. The internet provided a surveillance… er, data-collection engine of Orwellian dimensions, because everything one does on the network is automatically logged. The web enabled online commerce, which meant that oodles of personal data – name and address, age, gender, credit-card details, purchases and transactions, consumer preferences, interests, hobbies, etc – could be hoovered up by corporations, while software for tracking web browsing provided all kinds of equally interesting data for advertisers. The first generations of mobile phones logged their locations on a real-time basis, but that data was usually accessible only by telecommunications companies, or law-enforcement and security agencies, so we had to wait for smartphones with onboard GPS and consumer apps that revealed location data to complete the surveillance jigsaw.\nThe result was that we have moved with astonishing rapidity from a world in which data was scarce to one in which it is super-abundant. According to the Economist's Kenneth Cukier, for example, Google processes more than 24 petabytes a day. (A petabyte is 1,048,576 gigabytes.) The question – for both corporations and governments – was how to extract usable information from the torrent of data that was emerging from our networked existence as a kind of exhaust. Industry wanted to know how to \"personalise\" its offerings to consumers; advertisers wanted to be able to target ads more accurately; security agencies wanted to mine the exhaust to detect terrorists and prevent bad things from happening.\nAnd while all this was going on, science became increasingly data-intensive as new instruments spewed out unimaginable amounts of information. The Large Hadron Collider in Cern, for example, produces 15 petabytes of data a year. Telescopes and instruments used by astronomers and astrophysicists are similarly prolific generators of data torrents. The Square Kilometre Array telescope, for example, generates 915 petabytes of data a day. Other sciences are headed in the same direction. Biology has become increasingly computational: a single genome sequencing instrument generates terabytes of data a week. And so it goes on.\nGiven that there is no way that humans can handle these volumes of scientific, commercial and personal data, machine intelligence is the only way to go. And so technologies for dealing with the challenge have evolved – in the form of clusters of up to 50,000 computers, running specialised parallel-processing software and algorithms for machine-learning, pattern-recognition and other functions. Putting this stuff together and making it work is formidably difficult, which is why big data is, by definition, the province of large, well-financed corporations, research labs and government agencies. And it's also why mastery of the technology confers extraordinary advantages on those who possess it.\nThe dream\nVirtually every discussion about big data is suffused with a strange mixture of excitement, evangelism, hype, greed and fear. The excitement is easy to understand because it's clear that, for some, big data really is the new oil. The prosperity of the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of this world is, after all, largely built on their mastery of the technology. And, at a less stratospheric level, non-technology companies are beginning to realise that failure to analyse the data flowing from their interactions with customers may put them at a competitive disadvantage. In that sense, they are at the same stage as companies were in the early 1990s when it began to dawn on them that perhaps this internet thingy might have repercussions for them.\nBig data has implications for the way companies make decisions. As Erik Brynjolfsson of MIT puts it: \"Instead of relying on a leader's gut instincts, an increasing number of companies are embracing a new method that involves data-based analytics.\" (Think Moneyball, Michael Lewis's account of how a failing baseball team was rescued by relying not on the intuition of the team's talent scouts, but on the data crunched by a Harvard maths whiz.)\nDuring the first day of a baby’s life, the amount of data generated by humanity is equivalent to 70 times the information contained in the library of congress. Photograph: Catherine Balet from the series Strangers in the Light\nIn his research, Brynjolfsson found that companies that use \"data-driven decision-making\" show higher performance: a study of 179 large publicly traded firms, for example, found that the ones that adopted this method are about 5% more productive and profitable than their competitors. \"There is,\" he says, \"a lot of low-hanging fruit for companies that are able to use big data to their advantage.\"\nThe commercial imperative to take the big data revolution seriously is obvious, though many companies are going to discover that doing so will involve some painful decisions because their existing IT systems are too fragmented for meaningful data-analytics to be possible. What's more intriguing is the evangelical zeal with which the non-commercial world views the technology. It's seen as a way not just of discovering new knowledge, but as a way of improving healthcare, tackling poverty, improving governance, revitalising democracy, combating global warming and generally making life better.\nIn this context, a terrific boost came from Google some years ago in a paper published in the scientific journal Nature. In it the authors (who were Google employees) explained that Google could \"predict\" the spread of winter flu in the United States – not just nationally, but down to specific regions – and could do so well ahead of the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, which is the official agency for tracking disease outbreaks in the US. (The researchers deduced the spread of flu by tracking and analysing the geographical distribution of search queries such as \"winter flu\".) The results caused quite a furore among healthcare professionals, who wondered if the search giant had just handed them a powerful tool for epidemiological research.\nMetaphors that often surface in discussions about the social uses of big data are the microscope and the telescope – both instruments that enabled the rise of new sciences and greatly empowered established ones. Brynjolfsson favours the former. The microscope, invented four centuries ago, allowed people to see and measure things as never before — at the cellular level. It was a revolution in measurement. Data analytics, Brynjolfsson argues, is the modern equivalent of the microscope. Google searches, Facebook posts and Twitter messages make it possible to measure behaviour and sentiment in fine detail and in real time.\nAlex Pentland, another MIT scientist and author of a new book on what he calls \"social physics\", is similarly enthused. \"The power of big data,\" he says, \"is that it is information about people's behaviour instead of information about their beliefs. It's about the behaviour of customers, employees and prospects for your new business. It's not about the things you post on Facebook, and it's not about your searches on Google, which is what most people think about, and it's not data from internal company processes and RFIDs [radio-frequency identifications – a means of tracking items]. This sort of big data comes from things like location data off of your cell phone or credit card, it's the little data breadcrumbs that you leave behind you as you move around in the world.\"\n\"What those breadcrumbs tell,\" he continues, \"is the story of your life. It tells what you've chosen to do. That's very different from what you put on Facebook. What you put on Facebook is what you would like to tell people, edited according to the standards of the day. Who you actually are is determined by where you spend time, and which things you buy. Big data is increasingly about real behaviour, and by analysing this sort of data, scientists can tell an enormous amount about you. They can tell whether you are the sort of person who will pay back loans. They can tell you if you're likely to get diabetes.\n\"They can do this because the sort of person you are is largely determined by your social context, so if I can see some of your behaviours, I can infer the rest, just by comparing you to the people in your crowd. You can tell all sorts of things about a person, even though it's not explicitly in the data, because people are so enmeshed in the surrounding social fabric that it determines the sorts of things that they think are normal, and what behaviours they will learn from one another.\"\nThe nightmare\nWhat's interesting about this little riff is that Professor Pentland doesn't seem to be unduly troubled about the implications of all this – though, to be fair, since the quotes are taken from an interview he gave, it's possible that he gives a more rounded picture in his book. But the general tone of his remarks is pretty typical of big data enthusiasts. Sure, they say, there could be problems, but just look at the upsides –","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage because it discusses the extensive data collection and monitoring activities conducted by security agencies and corporations.

The best way to protect yourself is to limit the personal information you provide to companies to that which is absolutely necessary.\nIf you are concerned that a company may be keeping your data unnecessarily, you can request for them to destroy the data, according to the Australian privacy principles, but there is no requirement for them to do so unless they believe that data is no longer required.\nWhy do I have to change my banking and email passwords?\nThis is just a basic precaution. If you did not use those passwords anywhere else, and you are sure they are still secure, you are probably safe for now. If you are worried they might use other information they have to try to get into those accounts, make sure you have two-factor authentication set up. If allowed, make sure it’s a non-SMS authenticator like Google Authenticator as this is more secure.\nHas Optus broken any laws?\nOptus has not yet provided clear answers on how the data was obtained, or whether it was stored insecurely.

Optus may at some point offer compensation or access to other services like IDCare, which supports people who have personal cybersecurity concerns, but it is under no obligation to do so, and has not yet said whether it will.\nThe Optus chief executive, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, told reporters on Friday that the company had been engaging with IDCare but given the scale of the breach it was not clear whether they would be able to effectively support all affected customers.\nWhy does Optus store passport and licence information?\nOptus said it stored the data including passport and licence numbers for up to six years as required by Australian law. Companies need to keep a record of licence and passport numbers in order to verify the identity of a customer when they sign up for a new mobile service.\nCustomers’ personal data stolen as Optus suffers massive cyber-attack\nRead more\nThe attack is likely to spark debate about whether asking companies to retain this data for longer than is required for immediate identity verification is an acceptable risk.\nThe department of the federal attorney general is already in the process of finalising a report recommending changes to Australian privacy law, in part to deal with the growing amount of information companies collect about people online. That report is due out before the end of the year.\nAs part of that review, Optus argued against giving people a right to request their data be destroyed. The company told the review there were “significant hurdles” to implementing such a system which would come at “significant cost”.\nOptus also opposed changes to the Privacy Act to allow individuals to take direct action against companies for privacy breaches.\nShould I change my mobile \/ broadband provider?\nYou can, and it is likely some Optus customers will.

{"num":98,"Time":"Wed 4 May 2011 10.00 CEST","Title":"The biggest threat to NHS data security: its staff","Content":"Health service staff treat patient confidentiality as a given. But research by Guardian Healthcare shows that employees, rather than IT departments or management, are behind the leading reasons for that confidentiality being broken.\nFigures released by 30 trusts in London under Freedom of Information (FoI) suggest that data breaches consist mainly of staff losing devices or information, disposing of it inappropriately or giving out data in error.\nThere were a total of 899 data breaches of personal information by the 30 trusts in the capital from 2008 to early 2011. NHS Barnet topped the list with 187 data breaches of personal information over the last three years, with most breaches falling into its consent, communication and confidence or documentation (including record management) categories.\nChelsea and Westminster hospital foundation trust came second with 123 data breaches. The data suggests that the problem is getting worse: in 2008-09 the trust recorded 34 incidents, 44 in 2009-10 and 45 between April 2010 to February 2011.\nGuardian Healthcare asked all 71 trusts in London (before the formation of clusters) to list all data breaches by staff of personal information over the last three years, and received 30 responses with the requested data. This data was given in differing formats, with the level of detail in relation to incidents differing from trust to trust. This makes it difficult to put all the breaches into a definitive category, although on a broad scale the majority of incidents would be considered low level.\nBut the nature of most recorded incidents does suggest that a large number could have been prevented if better data security awareness was in place at these organisations. Such examples include a fax containing patient information being sent to the wrong person at one foundation trust, while confidential waste was emptied and bagged as recycling waste at another.\nThe most recent incidents at South London healthcare trust, which has logged 53 data breaches since 2008-09, involved the loss of a USB stick, emails being sent to the wrong email address, patient identifiable data being left behind the reception area by a doctor after he or she had left employment at the trust and a member of staff inappropriately viewing patient notes.\nThe reporting of data breaches remains a grey area. NHS organisations record them in different ways, using different categories to define breaches of personal information. It may also be a possibility that organisations are becoming better at spotting incidents and are therefore reporting them more, while the differing levels between trusts of similar size could be attributed to some not being as efficient as their counterparts at recording data breaches.\nCrime and punishment\nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has spoken repeatedly about the importance of clear security and disclosure procedures so that staff can understand and properly implement a code of conduct. It has also said that it will not hesitate to punish organisations if a \"serious\" breach of the Data Protection Act was likely to cause \"substantial\" damage or distress. But critics of the central government watchdog, which was given new powers last year to issue fines of up to £500,000 for breaches of the act, say that the ICO appears reluctant to impose such penalties.\nMost of the low level breaches reported by the London trusts were dealt with internally, with the most common action resulting in training and awareness sessions for staff involved in breaches or new procedures being implemented at the trusts concerned.\n\"Human error has always been the largest cause of data breaches in the NHS,\" said Victor Almeida, senior healthcare analyst at Kable. \"While it is true that some human errors are unavoidable, such as sending an e-mail to the wrong person, most could be mitigated or avoided by improving end-user legitimisation.\" This can mean restricting access to locations and preventing the storage of data on mobile media, replacing CDs and USB sticks with access to databases. Better authentication tools can also make a contribution, Almeida added.\nDespite high numbers of incidents at some NHS organisations, eight trusts have logged five or fewer data breaches over the past three years. These include NHS Barking and Dagenham and Newham university hospital, which both recorded five from 2008-09 to present, NHS Camden and London Ambulance Service with four, and King's College hospital foundation trust, which logged just three.\nThe London Ambulance Service said that two of the four incidents it has logged were considered serious, with both involving the theft of patient identifiable material. This included a \"small number\" of patient report forms being stolen from inside a vehicle in 2010 after a member of staff left them there inside a rucksack.\nThe best performance among the 30 trusts responding came from the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital trust, NHS Croydon and NHS Havering. which all said that there were no reported data breaches at their organisations between 2008-09 and the present.\nCorrection: This article has been corrected to make clear that the total number of data breaches of personal information by trusts stands at 899, not 909 as was originally specified.\nNews: NHS Barnet reveals 187 breaches of personal data\nData: Personal data breaches by London NHS trusts, 2008-11\nThis article is published by Guardian Professional.

A field of glittering solar panels run by a company with ties to the Egyptian military will be online in time for the conference, as well as a new shopping mall.\nNew surveillance technologies are also in place, so much so that Maj Gen Khaled Fouda, governor of South Sinai, recently boasted to a local cable channel that any visitors entering overland will be extensively searched at a gate encircling the city. He added that 500 white taxis commissioned to transport attenders during the conference will be equipped with interior cameras, all connected to a local “security observatory”, to monitor the footage.\nThere will be space for protesters to gather at Cop27, but only in a purpose-built area out near a highway and away from the conference centre or any other signs of life. Images of the designated protest area show a row of white painted cabins between a row of palm trees and a car park. It was unclear whether protesters will be permitted to spread out among the vast open landscape, or be forced to crowd next to the cabins to find relief from the desert sun.\n“It’s very chic, very clean. There are cafes and restaurants on site,” said Fouda, and: “No one is allowed here without registration.” He added that Egyptian authorities constructed the protest area in response to a spate of calls from western diplomats worried that demonstrations would be prevented at Cop27 in line with a ban on public protest that has existed for almost a decade.\n“This could be the most highly surveilled Cop in the history of the conference,” said Hussein Baoumi, of Amnesty International.\nA hotel in Egypt’s Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Photograph: Sayed Sheasha\/Reuters\nHe scoffed at the Egyptian government’s vision of a designated protest area. “It’s theatrics,” he said. “They don’t want to allow the right to protest or freedom of assembly, but they want to seem as though they are. It’s [president] Sisi’s vision of a protest – you go to a place and register and protest for an hour where no one can see you, and then they have you on camera where the authorities can see if you say something they don’t like. It’s the act of a state that doesn’t want to allow freedom of assembly, but doesn’t want to be called out for not permitting it.”\nFor many observers, Egypt’s choice to hold Cop27 in a resort town far from the country’s bustling capital with its population of 22 million is by design. Sharm el-Sheikh has long been used by Egypt’s leadership as a satellite location, a way to escape their own citizens and ensure that visiting dignitaries and officials are kept far from the country’s major cities when they attend state events. The purpose-built town draped between the sea and a backdrop of mountain ranges that resembles a lunar landscape features no central square or places where people could gather in large groups even if the law permitted. Instead, long, flat highways connect a web of luxurious high-end resorts, intended for visiting tourists or the Egyptian elite to gaze out on to the Red Sea, the ideal staging ground for intensive surveillance of anyone attending Cop27.\n“Sharm el Sheikh is a dream resort where the government can exclude the majority of Egyptians, and invest huge amounts of resources to ensure that everything is under surveillance and their control,” said Baoumi. “It’s telling how the Egyptian presidency and the leadership view their ideal society, it’s a gated one without the masses.”\nSurveillance of Cop27 attenders will also extend to their virtual world, via an app created by the Egyptian government to act as a guide to the conference facilities. “You can download the official Cop27 mobile app, but you must give your full name, email address, mobile number, nationality and passport number. Also you must enable location tracking,” tweeted Hossam Baghat, of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Baoumi added that technology specialists working for Amnesty International reviewed the app and flagged concerns about surveillance, due to its ability to access the user’s camera, microphone, location data and Bluetooth.\nThe complex of hotels and mansions in Sharm el-Sheikh have symbolised elite seclusion for decades. When Egypt’s former president Hosni Mubarak fled popular uprisings across mainland Egypt in 2011 it was for his mansion in Sharm el-Sheikh. Bakr bin Laden, former head of the family’s construction firm and half-brother of Osama, was one of Mubarak’s notable neighbours, known for doing business from his luxurious home.\nThe convention centre adjoining the Jolie Ville resort, with its lush gardens and a golf course built by a former Mubarak ally, also frequently hosts diplomatic events, a way for Egypt to welcome allies from Saudi Arabia or Israel in a remote location. But since coming to power in a military coup in 2013, Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has also been fond of using Sharm el-Sheikh as the venue for national conferences where the authorities can make sweeping decisions for the Egyptian citizenry far from any public input or scrutiny. This, notably, includes the state’s economic development conference in 2015, where he announced that Egypt would build a new capital in the desert outside Cairo, and received $12.5bn in donations from Egypt’s Gulf backers, as well as $12bn in deals with BP.\nSign up to Down to Earth\nFree weekly newsletter\nThe planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Zuma\/Alamy\nThere is a marked contrast between who is welcomed into the gated community of Sharm el-Sheikh and the treatment of those elsewhere in the Sinai peninsula, not least because Fouda oversaw the construction of a wall around the city in 2019 to “beautify and secure Sharm el-Sheikh”. The wall consists of concrete barriers and razor-wire with “four very beautiful doors” to access the town. Bedouin and local communities living in the north of the peninsula, meanwhile, have long been subject to neglect and state violence, including mass home demolitions that Human Rights Watch labelled a possible war crime.\nObservers say hosting Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh is a way for the Egyptian authorities to control which citizens interact with conference attendees, and to ensure that anyone permitted to enter is under heavy surveillance. “They don’t want Egyptians to interact with the world, or the world to interact with Egyptians,” said Baomi. “One of the major reasons for them hosting the Cop is greenwashing, to conceal the crimes that are happening inside the country and to prevent state delegations and officials from meeting with Egyptians”\nA participant who attended a briefing with Egyptian officials at the Bonn climate change conference this year described how they presented Cop27. “It was billed to us as a lovely vacation at all inclusive resorts,” they said. “They showed us pictures of luxury resorts and palm trees by the beach. It was extraordinary.\n“They implied we would be able to snorkel and go on snazzy excursions, that we’d be chauffeured from place to place – you’d think we were going on a dream holiday. Cop27 was being sold to us as a romantic five-star getaway when many are trying to raise concerns that civil society and delegates from the global south can’t afford the price of hotel rooms or get visas on time, to ensure that we can actually engage in some meaningful discussion and action.”\nUsing Cop27 to showcase Sharm el-Sheikh as a tourism destination does not bode well for vital climate negotiations, they added, . “It’s just very telling how these climate talks are now regarded. It’s not about what’s on the agenda or delivering results,” they said. “It’s just about bringing in money, greenwashing, and snapping beautiful pictures along the way.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems about privacy and location information leakage because it discusses the extensive surveillance and monitoring measures in place for the UN's Cop27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

Four letters. \"Poop.\"\nIt wasn't so much the word, but its position that caused New Jersey photojournalist Lori Nichols to turn her car around on a highway near Atlantic City close to midnight to snap a photo.\nThe word was lit up in bulbs on a freestanding temporary sign - the type that normally says \"road work ahead\" or \"slow down\".\nThe NJ.com reporter wrote a story about it the next day.\nThe sign stayed that way for several hours, she says. \"When I had a chance to call the local police department, Hamilton Township in Atlantic County, it was around noon or 1pm, a person I spoke to did chuckle a little bit when I asked about the sign.\n\"He said that a few people had called in the morning about it, so I would feel comfortable saying the sign remained that way for at least eight hours but probably more like 10 or 12,\" she says.\nYet, the prankster who seemingly gained easy access to an unlocked panel at the back of the sign could have typed out \"mass shooting ahead\" or \"terrorist threat in area\", and produced an entirely different outcome.\nHackers\nAnd this was just one sign without any connectivity to the cloud. Imagine if hundreds of signs controlled centrally had been compromised. That could have created large-scale chaos.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nMANAN VATSYAYANA\/AFP\nImage caption,\nIt is hoped that \"smart\" transport systems will be more efficient - for commuters and city authorities\nCybersecurity experts say we won't have to imagine for much longer. It's only a matter of time before hackers become interested in smart city transportation clouds.\nTaking control of parking, traffic lights, signage, street lighting, automated bus stops and many other systems could be appealing to bad guys from many walks of life including political activists and terrorists.\nMoscow has already experienced its first major transportation hack, albeit to make a serious point about security.\nDenis Legezo, a researcher with Kaspersky Lab, was able to manipulate traffic sensors and capture data simply by looking up a hardware user manual that was readily available online from the sensor manufacturer.\nA similar story comes from Cesar Cerrudo, the chief technology officer at security company IOActive Labs, who found vulnerabilities in systems used in the US, UK, France, Australia and China.\nThere's a scene in Die Hard 4 where hackers create chaos by manipulating traffic signals with a few keystrokes. It's not that easy, Mr Cerrudo wrote in a blog in 2014.\nEven so, he discovered that it would have been possible to create havoc using cheap computer hardware.\nEasier access\nMr Cerrudo says: \"I don't think now we are seeing many attacks, maybe some isolated attacks on lower maintained systems. But everything indicates that in the future they will become common because cyber threats are continually evolving.\n\"As technology gets widely adopted, cybercriminals get more familiar with it and get more resources. Maybe they attack transportation systems and say, 'If you want to keep running the system you have to pay up.'\"\nSince his \"experiment\" more than two years ago, there has been a huge investment in expanding smart city transportation technology around the world. America is no exception.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nCITY OF COLUMBUS\nImage caption,\nImage of the future: wireless connected trucks travel through Columbus, Ohio\nColumbus, in Ohio, was the recent winner of a $50m (£37.5m) prize offered by the US Department of Transportation. Prepaid cards and apps could allow residents to commute via bus and then arrange car and bicycle-sharing rides if needed.\nThe groundwork has already started, says Jeff Ortega, a spokesman for Columbus: \"The city recently completed construction of the Traffic Management Center, which is a high-tech area that can manage and monitor traffic signals around the city together with a $76m upgrade of traffic signals.\"\nIt is hoped emergency vehicles will be able to speed though intersections unhindered in the event of a major incident, and that more specialised bus routes can be offered to help low-income families get easier access to healthcare facilities.\nUltimately, it will mean a complex mix of new hardware and software that is secure enough to please city officials and the public.\nColumbus has already been offered software from Sidewalk Labs, which shares the same parent company as Google, Alphabet.\nBut in return for top-notch security, it's possible the \"FLOW\" transportation planning platform could have conditions attached, for instance an agreement that Sidewalk Labs share ownership of the data generated by the city and the right to process every transaction though its own payment system.\nThat idea raises many questions about the future control of cloud-based systems. Neither party would comment directly on the issue, pointing out that no contracts have been signed.\nSafe storage\nIn Kansas City, Missouri, the new RideKC Streetcar runs 2.2 miles and is free to use.\nThe Smart City project also includes in-street parking sensors, which allow car owners to find spaces near the streetcar route, and cameras placed on lamp posts that monitor traffic conditions and trigger brightness controls on nearby lights if a pedestrian enters the area.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nKANSAS CITY STREETCAR AUTHORITY\nImage caption,\nKansas City's Smart project includes street parking sensors allowing car drivers to find spaces near its new RideKC Streetcar\nKansas City made a conscious decision to make as much data as possible public. However, that doesn't mean everything has to be stored in one location in cyberspace, says Tom Gerend, executive director at Kansas City Streetcar Authority and chairman of the Smart City Advisory Board.\n\"The cloud is used to store data from the Smart City installation [camera data, streetlights, and so on] but not for streetcar vehicle specific systems. Generally, we have separate services for the individual sub-systems and then aggregate and pool data that we want to make publicly accessible.\"\nBut Von Welch, director of Indiana University's Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research, says there will be a bumpy road ahead as transportation hardware manufacturers start incorporating security measures into their products, often for the first time.\nQuick response\n\"We have a lot of companies making new devices for the [urban] Internet of Things that have not made computers or written software before. They are having to re-learn a lot of the lessons that the rest of the information technology industry learned over the past 20 years,\" Mr Welch says.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nIAN HARDY\nImage caption,\nGiving the green light to more \"smart\" systems is pointless if security can't be guaranteed, say experts\nThis includes how to respond promptly to security threats and gather information about bugs that the public may report.\nAnd IOActive's Cesar Cerrudo says cities and governments around the world have to get their act together as well, particularly when it comes to the cloud and building systems that are multi-layered and supposedly strong enough to keep all but the most determined intruders out.\nHe says: \"Governments are not enforcing cybersecurity in many ways. Vendors don't have any reason to provide more secure solutions because governments do not test the security. They just have a checklist and believe whatever the vendors say.\"\nMr Cerrudo warns that there is nothing smart about building a city that has the latest transportation technology, but leaving the infrastructure wide open to anyone who fancies a quick snoop around - or worse.\nFollow Technology of Business editor @matthew_wall on Twitter\nClick here for more Technology of Business features","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems related to privacy and location information leakage.

The paper’s latest revelations do not discuss the searching or examination of email content.\nThe Guardian said that the NSA Internet metadata collection initially began under a controversial warrantless wiretapping program authorized by the administration of President George W. Bush, but was later authorized by the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\nThe Guardian quoted Shawn Turner, chief spokesman for the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, saying that the collection program, which continued after Barack Obama became president, was terminated in 2011 “for operational and resource reasons and has not been re-started.”\nTurner added: “The program was discontinued by the Executive branch as the result of an interagency review.”\nAn official in the intelligence director’s office confirmed the accuracy of Turner’s quote.\nHowever, the Guardian said that it had seen other secret NSA papers which suggested that some collection of Americans’ online records continued today.\nPreviously, citing documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the Guardian reported that NSA also had been authorized by the FISA court to collect masses of similar “metadata” charting traffic between phone numbers which called each other both within the United States and between the United States and foreign countries.\nThe existence of such an NSA program was subsequently acknowledged by U.S. officials.\nThe Guardian’s latest story said that when NSA first started collecting Internet metadata in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the agency could only collect such material in cases where “at least one communicant” was located outside the United States “or for which no communicant was known to be a citizen of the United States.”\nHowever, the Guardian printed what it said was a 2007 U.S. Justice Department memo, classified secret, which it said indicated that NSA later got authority to “analyze communications metadata associated with United States persons and persons believed to be in the United States.” (Reporting By Mark Hosenball and Warren Strobel; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the analysis of the news you provided in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage, specifically related to the collection of raw Internet data on Americans by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).

{"num":99,"Time":"Thu 23 Oct 2014 23.11 CEST","Title":"Ten privacy questions Whisper should answer for Senate committee","Content":"The “anonymous” social media app Whisper has been summoned to Capitol Hill to answer questions posed by the powerful chair of the Senate commerce committee. Jay Rockefeller said revelations in the Guardian about how Whisper tracks its users raise “serious questions” over privacy and demanded an explanation.\nThe chairman’s letter was delivered a week after the Guardian published three stories about Whisper’s business practices.\nHere are 10 key questions Whisper should answer.\n1. How did Whisper obtain the broad location of some users who opted out of geolocation services?\nThe Guardian’s reporting was based on a three-day visit to Whisper’s Los Angeles headquarters to explore the possibility of working together on journalistic projects. This visit, which took place last month, was hosted by the editor-in-chief, Neetzan Zimmerman.\nTargeted location tracking was a key method Zimmerman’s editorial team used to find and then vet users they believed to be newsworthy. Whisper could (and did) begin private “chats” with users and also inspected their activity history on the app. But the vetting process also involved looking up a user’s movements to see if they matched the claims they were making in their posts.\nBut there was a problem. How could they find the location of users who had opted out of geolocation services? Zimmerman told reporters the company had other means of ascertaining approximate locations of those who had asked not to be followed. But his editorial team didn’t just claim this. They supplied the evidence.\nOne document Zimmerman’s team gave to the Guardian listed a number of users who Whisper had identified as potentially newsworthy. It was titled “Potential Guardian Leads”. Others were shared via email. Several of the users Whisper identified for the Guardian, and encouraged the reporters to investigate, had opted out of their location services. Despite this, Whisper obtained their approximate location and supplied it to the Guardian.\n2. Why do Whisper executives disagree about how the company tracks users?\nIt turns out Whisper collects two kinds of location data. The first is GPS-based data, provided by users who opt into geolocation services. The second is IP data, which gives only the rough location of all users, including those have opted out of their geolocation services.\nWhen Zimmerman’s editorial team do not have access to GPS-based data (because users have declared through the app they don’t want their location tracked), they sometimes ascertain their rough location through IP addresses.\nWhisper initially said this disclosure was “entirely false” and had been concocted by reporters. “When I specifically say that they are lying, that’s what I mean – that does not happen, and it simply can’t happen,” Zimmerman told tech news website Gigaom.\nBut Whisper’s senior vice-president, Eric Yellin, had already acknowledged the practice. He told the Guardian before the stories were published: “We occasionally look at user IP addresses internally to determine very approximate locations.” That admission was made in an email exchange about the editorial practices of Zimmerman’s team.\nSo who is right? Zimmerman or Yellin? And why do they disagree?\n3. How did Whisper ‘vet’ the users featured in Buzzfeed and Huffington Post articles?\nWhisper had established partnerships with Buzzfeed, the Huffington Post and Fusion, all of which have since suspended those partnerships. But these previous collaborations raise important questions about Whisper’s vetting process.\nOne Buzzfeed article featured Whisper messages about sexual assaults in the military. Whisper told Buzzfeed it had “vetted every account using our back-end tools and filtered out any we thought might be bogus claims”. Of the 23 Whisper posts featured in the Buzzfeed article, five were from by users who had opted out of geolocation. So how did Whisper “vet” these users?\nThe same can be asked of a Huffington Post article featuring Whisper users who claimed to be college students discussing virginity. Four out of seven of the Whisper postings came from users who had opted out of geolocation services.\nWhen the Guardian undertook three small journalistic projects with Whisper earlier this year, Zimmerman’s editorial team did not indicate they were ascertaining the broad location of some users who had opted out of geolocation services.\n4. Why does Whisper collect detailed GPS data from users if it doesn’t need it?\nJonathan Zdziarski, a security expert who specialises in forensic analysis of operating systems, has published a detailed assessment of Whisper’s back-end system. He concluded: “Anonymous users have good reason to be concerned about their anonymity when using the Whisper application.” Among the concerns raised by Zdziarski, an expert in Apple systems, was the type of GPS data he said Whisper is requesting from Apple devices.\nAccording to Zdziarski, Whisper could ask Apple for GPS data that is accurate within a 1km or 3km radius. Instead, the app requests GPS data that is accurate to within a 100-meter radius and only “fuzzes” or “salts” that data, rendering it accurate to within 500meters, once it has arrived on the company’s servers. The “nearby” facility on Whisper’s app – the ostensible reason the company collects GPS data in the first place – only allows users to see messages posted within a one-mile radius. So why is Whisper collecting GPS data accurate to within a 100-metre radius?\n5. Is Whisper now accepting it (passively) tracks users?\nWhisper initially responded to the Guardian’s stories by insisting that it “does not follow or track users”. But as Rockefeller notes in his letter, Heyward has since put it differently. Heyward now states Whisper does not “actively” track its users. Why the change in wording? Is he saying Whisper doesn’t track users all the time, only when they are interesting or newsworthy? How does the company explain the difference?\n6. Why does Whisper indefinitely store location data that is linked back to individual users?\nWhat many users of the app may not realise is that Whisper is indefinitely storing their information in a database that, in the case of most users, can be viewed through an in-house mapping tool.\nWhisper stores information linked to individual users. That’s how, when Zimmerman’s team spot a newsworthy user, they can scour their historical activity on the app and review past messages – including those a user may believe they have deleted. The precise time and general location of messages is recorded (for the 80% who opt into geolocation services), providing a trail of breadcrumbs that can be used to track a person’s movements over time. Rockefeller has asked Whisper to explain the extent to which it “retains user data”.\nThe company states it is only holding user data for “a brief period of time”. So why does it keep this data in a searchable database and store it indefinitely?\n7. Why didn’t Whisper tell users it was sharing information with the Pentagon?\nWhisper has been sharing information with the US Department of Defense to help with research into suicides. The study exploits the location data Whisper acquires by searching messages the company knows have been sent from US military bases. Heyward has defended the practice and said his company “can’t wait to establish more of these relationships”. But why did Whisper keep this project secret from its users in the first place?\n8. Why didn’t Whisper tell its users about its overseas base in the Philippines?\nWhisper has hired more than 100 staff in the Philippines to constantly monitor messages posted on its app to stamp out inappropriate behaviour. When the Guardian asked Whisper what security measures were in place at the company’s Filipino site, the company provided no specific information but insisted the process was “extremely secure”. At that time, as Rockefeller notes, Whisper was providing its users no indication their data was being held or processed overseas. In fact, the company’s terms of service told users “we process and store all information in the United States”.\nFour days after learning the Guardian planned to publish its stories, Whisper rewrote its terms of service. The new terms, introduced on 13 October, acknowledge user information is also stored in “other countries”. “This may be important to you, as the laws of the United States or such other countries may not be as protective of your personal information as the laws of your jurisdiction,” the new policy states. Why were users not told this before?\n9. Is Whisper claiming that none of the changes to its terms of service are related to the Guardian’s reporting?\nFour days after learning the Guardian planned to publish details about Whisper’s business practices, the company rewrote its terms of service. Rockefeller has demanded Whisper’s current terms of service, as well as copies of the policies in effect at the launch of the company and at the time it introduced its geolocation feature.\nHeyward and his chief technology officer, Chad DePue, have said the changes to the terms of service were unrelated to the Guardian’s reporting. Heyward said the changes were “finalised” in July and were due to be published in October. He added: “However, our communications with the Guardian made it clear that our users would benefit from seeing them sooner.” Heyward not mention that Whisper’s terms of service were also updated in September.\nDePue has offered to make public his correspondence with Whisper’s lawyers to prove the “entire point” of the changes to the terms of service was to make them more user-friendly.\nIs Whisper claiming that none of the changes were related to the Guardian’s reporting?\n10. Why did Whisper deny the existence of a user claiming to be a sex-obsessed lobbyist?\nWhen two reporters visited Whisper’s headquarters last month, they had extensive discussions with executives at the company over three days. At no stage during the visit were the journalists told they could not report on the information shared with them by Whisper. Indeed, Whisper has since acknowledged the reporters were entitled to write about what they discovered. Columbia Journalism Review has written about the nature of the Guardian’s reporting.\nWhile conversations during the visit were on the record, the Guardian felt it was fair to avoid naming any executives who were not specifically giving quotes for attribution. One such executive told the reporters about an apparently sex-obsessed Whisper user who claims to be a lobbyist in Washington DC. “He’s a guy that we’ll track for the rest of his life and he’ll have no idea we’ll be watching him,” the Whisper executive said. The quote was heard by two reporters, as their records of the conversation show.\nZimmerman – who was not present when the executive made the remark – described the quote about the lobbyist as “100% fabricated”. He added: “It is a fabrication because it was never said, and no such person exists.”\nThe Washington DC lobbyist’s whisper. Photograph: The Guardian\nThat person does exist. Zimmerman’s editorial team nicknamed the lobbyist ‘50 shades of grey’ and believed him to be a potentially newsworthy find. They actively encouraged the Guardian reporters to delve into the lobbyist’s history of activity on the app. The lobbyist was one of the users included in the “Potential Guardian Leads” document that Whisper provided the Guardian.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"The news is relevant to privacy concerns as it discusses how the anonymous social media app Whisper has been summoned to Capitol Hill to answer questions about its tracking of users.\",\n\"The news highlights concerns about how Whisper obtained the broad location of some users who had opted out of geolocation services and how they supplied this information to the Guardian.\",\n\"It questions why Whisper collects detailed GPS data from users when it may not need such precise data for its functionality.\",\n\"The news raises concerns about Whisper's storage of location data linked to individual users and its sharing of information with the Pentagon without informing users.\",\n\"It also questions why Whisper did not inform its users about its overseas base in the Philippines and the changes in its terms of service, which were made after the Guardian's reporting.\",\n\"The news highlights discrepancies in statements made by Whisper executives and their claims about tracking users, indicating a lack of transparency.\",\n\"It discusses the existence of a user claimed to be a sex-obsessed lobbyist and the discrepancies in statements made by Whisper executives regarding this user.\",\n\"Overall, the news is highly relevant to privacy and location information leakage concerns.\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2014\/oct\/23\/10-questions-whisper-senate-hearing-privacy","query_name":"updated_file_Security_Measures_for_Location_Data.xlsx"}

But there could be other malicious processes running on a compromised device that will only be stopped by turning the phone off.\n“If there’s a process running from the adversarial side, turning off the phone breaks the chain, even if it’s only for the time the phone is off, it certainly frustrates the potential hacker.\n“It may not fully protect you, but [rebooting] can make things more difficult” for hackers, Nanda said.\nExperts, while backing the advice of a regular reboot, have previously flagged the strategy is unlikely to stop determined hackers targeting a specific individual – especially in light of the proliferation of sophisticated technologies used to hack world leaders revealed in recent years.\nSign up to Five Great Reads\nFree weekly newsletter\nEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

How Western states used maps to downplay size of continent","Content":"STORY HIGHLIGHTS\nThe Mercator projection has been used as a template for world maps since 1569\nIt shows Africa as being smaller than it is\nBoston schools are taking a stand against it by introducing another projection\nCNN\n — \nOn a typical world map, Canada is a vast nation. Home to six time zones, its endless plains spread from ocean to ocean, dominating great swathes of the northern half of the globe. But, in reality, three Canadas would comfortably fit inside Africa.\nOur world map is wildly misleading. It’s all down to the European cartographer Geert de Kremer, better known as Mercator, and his 16th century map projection – a common template for world maps today – which distorts the size of countries.\nNow, schools in Boston are taking a stand against the tradition by introducing the lesser-known Peters projection from the 1970s (also called Gall-Peters projection) in classrooms, to teach children the real size of the continents.\nThe move is part of a wider initiative to remove bias within education.\n“By incorporating the Peters projection maps – an equal area representation – into classrooms, we are opening the door for students to view the world in a different light,” says Natacha Scott, social studies director at Boston Public Schools.\nThe initiative will see students comparing different maps.\n“By exploring geography, we also hope to increase an awareness of the relationship between themselves to other countries, communities, cultures and individuals around the world,” Scott adds.\nThe Peters projection maps areas in their actual sizes relative to each other, but in doing so distorts their shapes.\nCourtesy Strebe \/ Wikimedia Commons\nThough a convenient way to chart the world, Mercator’s map distorts proportions, making some landmasses larger that they are in reality.\n“Somehow this map projection came to be used on most world maps, especially those produced for classrooms since the beginning of the 1900s,” says Menno-Jan Kraak, president of the International Cartographic Association and professor of cartography at the University of Twente, Netherlands.\n“Most of us have grown up with this world image.”\nMade for captains\nThe 1569 Mercator projection was made for navigating the seas – drawing the meridians and parallels as straight lines that cross at right angles helped sailors to navigate some of the their first treacherous voyages around the world.\nMercator initially made globes. Later transferring his map from a three-dimensional curved surface to a flat sheet of paper was problematic. Taking the equator as the logical map center left big, confusing gaps near the poles.\nMercator’s solution was to stretch out the northern and southern extremities of the globe to fill those gaps, producing an elegant and usable map.\nWhile a revolutionary tool for captains and explorers, the projection distorts the relative size of the continents, to the advantage of the West.\nThe repercussions of this are still being felt today.\nA map made by Europe for Europe\nOn the Mercator map, Africa – sitting on the equator, reasonably undistorted – is left looking much smaller than it really is.\nBut Canada, Russia, the United States and Europe are greatly enlarged.\nThe distortion is largest near the poles: Greenland, which looks about the same size as the whole of Africa on the Mercator, is a classic example. In truth, it is no bigger than the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThat European and North American countries are enlarged is no accident. This system provided more space for Western cartographers to mark towns, cities, roads etc in their part of the world, Kraak says.\n“If you would take a map projection with equal areas then there is almost no space on the map to display all [these details].”\nThere was, of course, much to map in Africa, too, but that mattered less to the cartographers up north, he adds.\nA political tool?\nOne of the dangers of the Mercator map is that it can make enlarged countries seem unnaturally powerful and intimidating.\n“The term ‘power of representation and representation of power’ sums up quite well how maps and the rise of the Western nation-state system – and with that, empire and colonialism – are linked,” says Marianne Franklin, professor of Global Media and Politics at Goldsmiths, University of London.\nWas subsequent European imperialism perhaps spurred on by a map projection that reinforced the notions of self-importance held by those nations?\n“The world maps that prevail today have been embedded in Western imaginations since the British empire. They continue (to prevail) despite many challenges to their fairness and accuracy because they underpin the ongoing Anglo-Euro-American presumption that the world belongs to them, and pivots around these geo-cultural axes,” Franklin says.\nIn more recent times, maps have been used for propaganda, adds Kraak.\nTake Russia, for example.\n“If you take the Mercator projection, where Russia looks huge, give it a bright red color and then compare it to the rest of Europe, you see how dangerous it can look,” says Kraak.\nNo perfect map\nChart of the world as per Mercator's projection, circa 1798, with the most recent discoveries.\nHulton Archive\/Hulton Archive\/Getty Images\nSadly, there is no such thing as a perfect map. Because the earth is a sphere – more of a potato-shape, in fact – it is impossible to map it on a flat surface without errors in proportion, explains Kraak.\nAlso the Peters projection has its flaws. In order to show the actual size of land masses, their shapes are distorted.\nBoston Public Schools are rolling out the new maps in all second, seventh and eleventh grades for now, and aim to place them in all classrooms in the future.\nOther alternative maps are being introduced around the world too. In the US and Germany, for example, maps based on the so-called Winkel Tripel projection, which has a smaller skewness, started to replace the Mercator in the 1920s.\nA digital boost\nBut the Mercator still dominates and the digital revolution has further strengthened its position.\nToday the Mercator projection is used as a template at Google Maps, OpenStreetMap and Bing, says Kraak.\nFrom guiding 16th century explorers on the high seas to helping people find Pokemons on their smartphones, Mercator’s work continues to influence how people see the world centuries after his death.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to technical map-making errors because it discusses the distortion of the world map caused by the Mercator projection, a common template for world maps since 1569.

A majority of the 35 member countries voted in favour of the resolution, which Costa Rica hailed as a \"diplomatic victory\". Google said on Friday that it had used faulty data to create the initial online map, which has now been updated.\nBut Nicaragua refused the OAS request. Ortega, who has been president since January 2007, said the OAS had \"completely killed\" any possibility of the dispute being resolved through dialogue – and went on to accuse a number of neighbouring countries of being influenced by the drugs trade.\n\"That OAS meeting completely killed the possibility of dialogue,\" he said. \"They killed it because they started to establish conditions. I repeat, on a matter of principle, we are not leaving any area within Nicaraguan territory along the borders with our brotherly nations of Costa Rica and Honduras, nor are we pulling any of our forces from any maritime borders. Not the army, not the police who are in the fight against drug trafficking.\"\nThe president's dispatch riled nearby Mexico, which sent a diplomatic letter to the country in protest at its \"unfounded and unjustified accusations\". Costa Rica accused Ortega of \"recklesskly [launching] accusations about drug trafficking against various Latin American nations in his desire to distract his people from the overwhelming defeat suffered [in the OAS resolution].\"\nOrtega went on to accuse Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Honduras and Guatemala of being influenced in their OAS vote by the drug trade. Mexico's war against drugs trafficking is reported to have claimed more than 28,000 lives since President Felipe Calderón launched a crackdown on the influential cartels nearly four years ago.\nNicaragua moved security forces into the contested river border late last month to carry out a dredging project. An official in charge of the project told a local newspaper that he had used Google Maps to decide where the work should take place, though the mapping service later turned out to be incorrect. Costa Rica described the move as an \"invasion\" and appealed to the OAS for a resolution.\nThe ownership of Calero, a small section of land near the Atlantic coast, has been contested by the Central American nations for two centuries.\nGoogle said in a blogpost that it had used faulty data from the US State Department which led to the error.\nCosta Rican president Laura Chinchilla said the country \"is seeing its dignity smeared and there is a sense of great national urgency\" to resolve the dispute.

It also took the additional step of prominently displaying the rival services on its Apps Store.\n“It is a bit unusual but at the same time, Tim is keeping Apple’s commitment to provide the best user experience for customers,” Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said. “A key reason for Apple’s success is keeping customers happy so we think this is a good move.”\n“People forget that Google Maps started out inferior to Mapquest and Yahoo Maps,” he added.\nApple’s home-grown Maps feature -- stitched together by acquiring mapping companies and data from many providers including Waze, Intermap, DigitalGlobe and Urban Mapping -- was introduced with much fanfare in June by software chief Scott Forstall. It was billed as one of the key highlights of the updated iOS6 software.\nBut errors and omissions in the maps service quickly emerged after the software was rolled out, ranging from misplaced buildings and mislabelled cities to duplicated geographical features.\nApple CEO Tim Cook waves at the end of Apple Inc.'s iPhone media event in San Francisco, California September 12, 2012. REUTERS\/Beck Diefenbach\nNEW APPLE\nThe last time Apple faced such widespread criticism was in 2010, when users complained of signal reception issues on the then-new iPhone 4 model.\nA defiant Jobs at the time rejected any suggestion the iPhone 4’s design was flawed, but offered consumers free phone cases at a rare, 90-minute press conference called to address those complaints.\nWhile Apple fixed the issue, Jobs had apologized to users only after he was specifically asked if he was sorry. He also said the issue was shared by all the major manufacturers, naming rivals Research in Motion, Samsung Electronics and HTC Corp.\nCook himself played a key role in convincing Jobs to tackle the negative publicity that arose around that issue, something he was initially reluctant to do, according to his biographer.\n“Finally Tim Cook was able to shake him out of his lethargy,” Walter Isaacson said in his biography on the late Silicon Valley icon. “He quoted someone as saying that Apple was becoming the new Microsoft, complacent and arrogant. The next day Jobs changed his attitude.”\nIt remains to be seen how fast Apple can fix the mapping glitches. Jobs had been in a similar position when he allowed email synchronization software MobileMe to launch in 2008, to deadly reviews. The mercurial CEO took the group to task for it and replaced the group’s head. The service is now folded into the iCloud product.\nMapping is a complex process that takes a lot of resources and years to perfect, said Marcus Thielking, co-founder of Skobbler, maker of the popular GPS Navigation 2 app, built using the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap platform.\n“It helps a lot if you have great data to start with,” he said, adding that it appears that different database were thrown together in building Apple Maps. “They (Apple) can offer incremental updates and that’s what they will do.”\nCook said that more than 100 million iOS devices are using the new Apple Maps and that the more people use Maps, the better it will get. He also offered some hints on why the company decided to remove Google Maps.\nApple launched the Google-powered Maps “initially with the first version of iOS” and created a home-grown version of the service as it wanted to provide more features, Cook said.\n“As time progressed, we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turn-by-turn directions, voice integration, Flyover and vector-based maps,” he said in the letter.\nGoogle provides turn-by-turn navigation on Android-based devices but the popular feature was not available for Apple devices. Apple Maps replaced Google Maps in iOS 6 and the Google service is now only available through a browser.\nShares of Apple fell 2 percent to close at $667.10 on Nasdaq.\nEditing by Edwin Chan and Richard Chang\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to Technical map-making errors because it discusses the glaring errors and issues with Apple's new Maps service.

But the introduction last week – which did bring voice-directed turn-by-turn navigation – also caused an outcry over misplaced towns, misnamed suburbs, parks designated as airfields and the loss of public transport directions compared with the Google data offered on the previous version of iOS.\n\"We are doing everything we can to make Maps better,\" Cook wrote in a letter posted on Apple's site – a method frequently used by Cook's predecessor Steve Jobs to issue messages when Apple was facing criticism.\nApple has apologised in the past for errors – though sometimes grudgingly. When Apple lowered the price of the original iPhone by $200 in September 2007, just weeks after it had gone on sale and thousands had been bought, Jobs offered aggrieved users a $100 voucher – but told them that \"this is the price of living in the technology lane\". When Apple launched its MobileMe service, offering cloud-based synchronisation of emails and calendars, it was initially disastrous – leading Jobs to apologise publicly. When the iPhone 4 design turned out to have attenuation problems with its external antenna, Jobs was eventually moved to offer refunds and a free cover for the phone.\nCook says in the letter that \"we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turn-by-turn directions, voice integration, [satellite view] Flyover and vector-based maps [which store data in a single file rather than needing repeated downloads to work]. In order to do this, we had to create a new version of Maps from the ground up.\"\nAlthough iOS 6 was only released formally on 19 September, Cook says there are now more than 100m devices using it with the new Apple Maps, \"with more and more joining us every day.\" He said that users \"have already searched for nearly half a billion locations\" and that such feedback will improve the quality.\nUnusually, Cook recommends that users who are dissatisfied with Apple's offering should try rival services. These include apps by MapQuest, Waze and Microsoft's Bing, or maps from Google and Nokia via web browsers.\nHowever, Google's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, indicated earlier this week that the search giant is not presently developing an app for iOS.\n''What were we going to do, force (Apple) to include the software?\" Schmidt said in Tokyo on Monday, adding that Google has no plans at present to complete its iOS Google Maps app and submit it to Apple.

leaving some communities feeling misrepresented, Zook said.\nA spokeswoman for Google said that the company gets its data on neighborhoods from a combination of third-party providers and public sources and stressed that it encourages everyone to report any errors.\n“Overall, this provides a comprehensive and up-to-date map, but when there are inaccuracies, we work to address (them) as quickly as possible,” she said in emailed comments.\nFRUITS OR MEDICS?\nTo Fruit Belt residents, the new name looked like a nod to the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, a large medical center that was being built on the edge of the working-class, predominantly African-American neighborhood, local activists said.\nAt the time, locals said they were starting to be priced out of their homes by wealthier medical workers coming to live in the area, and many interpreted the name change as a signal that the community was losing its battle against gentrification.\n“When they took away our name, they took away our identity,” said Hemphill-Nichols, a housing campaigner, adding she thought that would lead to the medical park eating up more of the neighborhood.\nSarah Warner, a spokeswoman for the medical center, said it never requested any name change on Google Maps.\nThe Buffalo council also offered residents few answers, Hemphill-Nichols said, adding that at a town hall meeting called after the change emerged, an official pointed to a long forgotten, four decade-old planning assessment as a possible source for the name.\nThe council was not available to comment.\nThe Fruit Belt eventually returned to its original designation earlier this year, after a local daily contacted Google for an article about the issue.\n“You have no idea what a load was lifted off me,” said Hemphill-Nichols.\nNOT MY NEIGHBORHOOD\nZook said that Google, hungry for data, often gets its place names from whatever maps it can find, even if they are not strictly official, and ends up giving that information more authority than its authors originally intended.\nFor the Italian city of Milan, Google appears to have largely drawn from a map created by local blog Urbanfile, said its author Roberto Arsuffi, who explained that he had made up some of the place names.\nArsuffi said that he sometimes used little-known landmarks to describe small, unnamed areas when coming up with location labels for his map.\nFor example, he named the district of Acquabella after an old farmhouse and a nearby railway junction, both of which have since been demolished.\nBut on official maps, Acquabella does not exist as a distinct area with its own name - its territory is split between two larger districts.\nGoogle Maps picked up Arsuffi’s names a few weeks after the Urbanfile map was published about five years ago, Arsuffi explained.\nSuddenly some Milanese found themselves living in unknown neighborhoods.\n“I’ve been here 10 years and I’ve never heard of it,” said a local bar owner after being told that, according to Google, his property was within the boundaries of Acquabella.\nArsuffi said he had contacted Google to flag inaccuracies he spotted online, but received no reply.\nGoogle said it had not directly taken names from Urbanfile’s map but that users had made those edits to its map through Map Maker, a now-defunct tool that allowed the public to make contributions to Google Maps.\nPREVENTIVE STRIKE\nWith Map Maker out of service since 2017, map enthusiasts in Leeds, England, have been testing other methods of preserving beloved place names perceived as being at risk of disappearing.\nIn 2018, upon hearing that a developer was planning to build new flats in the area known as Quarry Hill - once home to the largest social housing complex in Britain - and rename it SOYO, local writer Chris Nickson sent a complaint to the council.\n“In a stroke, this erases centuries of Leeds history,” he wrote in the letter, which he also posted on Twitter.\nThe appeal against the moniker SOYO, which stands for “South of York Road”, was taken up by Thomas Forth, head of data at the Open Data Institute Leeds, a think tank.\nHe marked the area in central Leeds as Quarry Hill on OpenStreetMap, a Wikipedia-style mapping service, hoping it would be picked up by Google and other online map providers.\n“Changing a name could be seen as an extreme example of gentrification,” Forth said in a phone interview.\n“Especially if former or current residents feel that the names they use are not welcome anymore”.\nA spokeswoman for SOYO said in an email that the development will cover only part of Quarry Hill and will regenerate the site, bringing new residential housing, as well as bars, restaurants and a hotel.\nShe said the company would work to update signage, reference points and online information with the new name as construction progressed, adding that the area had been a car park for more than 40 years after the council blocks were demolished.\n“Our project marks the beginning of a new chapter for this part of the city,” she said.\nBut for now, that chapter has no name - at least on Google Maps.\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Jumana Farouky and Zoe Tabary.

{"num":16,"Time":"Sun 20 Dec 2020 10.00 CET","Title":"Google Maps postcode error leads delivery drivers on wild pizza chase","Content":"I\nf Simon Borghs wanted to eat a takeaway pizza fresh out of the box, he would have to sit in the local park. Taking a taxi meant lengthy discussions with the driver to ensure that he got to his flat. Getting a delivery meant walking down the road with his phone in his hand looking for the courier.\nHis problem was that the postcode for his east London flat was incorrect on Google Maps, so any driver using the service for navigation ended up not at his address, but in parkland at Three Mills Green, Bromley-by-Bow, half a mile away as the crow flies, but a mile and a half to drive.\nWhat was an easily fixable error resulted in three years of frustration for Borghs, who first noticed the problem when an Uber driver took a wrong turn when taking him home.\nHe is far from alone. Google’s community centres for Maps regularly has posts from people who have found themselves in a similar position and are attempting to correct the error. It underlines our increasing reliance on private companies and the data they hold – and the resulting problems when it is wrong.\n“The problem is with third-party companies using Google Maps as the basis for their operations,” says Borghs, who moved to London from Belgium seven years ago. “The major issues are with Uber, Uber Eats and Deliveroo etc.\n“The food delivery drivers and cyclists consistently end up in the wrong place or get lost and are at risk of ‘losing their ticket’ – ie, not getting paid – if they don’t figure out where to go, or we find them first within their delivery time slot.\n“In fact, in most cases, they get lost in the middle of a massive building site to the north of us. The road through has restricted access so they end up in the park to the east of us.”\nTo get around the problem, Borghs has tried putting instructions in the notes for deliveries, or using a different address nearby and going out to intercept the drivers. “This applies to anyone that goes on the postcode – plumbers, cleaners, family,” he says.\nThe change in his Google Maps’ postcode, he says, came about randomly. On one day in 2018 he had no problem with deliveries and the next, his home had been relocated to the park. While the actual postcode remained the same, Google had assigned it to the new location.\nGoogle says that it wants its mapping service to “model and reflect this ever-evolving world” and puts together its maps using a combination of information from different sources.\nSatellite imagery and data gathered via its Street View cars tell the company where roads, buildings and addresses are. This is added to with information from local governments, which can upload data about new roads and addresses in an area.\nAfter that, comes people – Google has a community of “local guides” who can correct the map if they are confident a change is necessary. If there is something wrong, Google Map users are encouraged to report it to the company via a feedback button.\nThis is exactly what Borghs says he has done over the last three years. “In Chrome, I’ve tried the ‘send feedback’ approach to alert ‘wrong information’ – these tickets were closed without any answers. I’ve also tried to add our full address through ‘add a missing place’, which wasn’t successful, either,” he says.\nA community forum on Google Maps also provided no answers. “I’ve tried five or six times to post a question here but never get a reply,” he says. “If you browse through it for a few minutes you’ll find many similar posts about UK postcodes – some get answered, some don’t.\n“This shows that this is a widespread issue that should be dealt with by Google in one go, and not by volunteers in a piecemeal way. There’s no way to get them to do this that I’ve found – which is probably the most frustrating bit.”\nOur daily lives rely on this information being correct – you could argue it’s a public service that is not being dealt with\nSimon Borghs\nThree years since the problem first arose, it took less than 24 hours for Google to take action once the Observer made contact – it even thanked us for flagging the error despite the years of Borghs trying to do the same.\nGoogle says it uses automated and manual ways to check for accuracy and tries to correct errors as soon as they arise. But it failed to answer questions on why the problem persisted in Borghs case. Nor would it tell us how many people contact it to correct errors.\n“We use a number of sources to accurately model the real world, including authoritative third-party sources, contributions from users, and Street View and satellite imagery,” it says.\n“Overall, this provides an accurate, up-to-date map, and when there are inaccuracies, we work to address them as quickly as possible. As always, we encourage users to let us know when something is incorrect by using our ‘report a problem’ tool.”\nBut as Borghs points out: “Our daily lives rely on this information being correct – you could argue it’s a public service that is not being dealt with, with the appropriate level of care.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about technical map-making errors.

REUTERS\/Beck Diefenbach\nWelcome to the new world of Apple Maps that greeted iPhone and iPad users when they downloaded the highly anticipated update to the consumer giant’s mobile software platform, iOS 6.\nApple Inc’s home-grown Maps feature was introduced with much fanfare in June by Apple’s software chief Scott Forstall and is a direct challenge to the same service offered by friend-turned-rival Google Inc.\nBut the app is already facing criticism from users globally for a number of geographical errors, missing information and because it lacks features that made Google Maps so popular, including public transit directions, comprehensive traffic data or street view pictures.\nApple Maps has replaced Google Maps, which is no longer available on iOS 6.\nMany users who downloaded Apple’s iOS 6 software, released on Wednesday, took to Twitter and online forums to express their frustration at the glitches.\n“The people who thought the world was flat were more accurate cartographers than Apple Maps,” @RayneBradley said on Twitter.\n“Apple Maps also have errors in business listings. I went to call a local taxi driver and it was a taxidermist (seriously),” said @TomDavenport on Twitter.\nApple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company launched the new service knowing it was a major initiative.\n“Maps is a cloud-based solution and the more people use it, the better it will get,” she said. “We appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better.”\nThe criticism comes on the eve of the launch of Apple’s iPhone 5, which hits stores around the globe on Friday. The iPhone 5 comes pre-loaded with the new iOS 6 software and Maps.\nUsers have created a Tumblr blog sarcastically dubbed “The Amazing iOS 6 Maps” where many have posted screen shots of the errors (ht tp:\/\/theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com\/) . Pictures showed the Norwegian town of Leknes in the Norwegian sea, the entire city center of Stratford-upon-Avon is labeled as a hospital.\nSome of the errors have even irked politicians. Irish Minister for Justice Alan Shatter said he was surprised to discover that Airfield -- a 35-acre estate with working farm and café in center of his constituency in Dundrum, Ireland -- has been labeled with the image of an aircraft.\nHe said this could be dangerous for pilots and suggested in a statement that Apple use the image of “a cow, a goat, a sheep, a flower” instead, and that an “aircraft is an entirely inappropriate flight of imagination.”\nUsers in Asia were surprised to see two sets of the disputed territory of Senkaku Islands. Some joked that this was Apple’s effort at providing a diplomatic solution to Japan and China, both of which claim the islands.\nNOT AN EASY FIX\nCloser to home, New York city residents are unhappy that Apple maps doesn’t offer public transit directions, one of the most-used features on Google Maps in cities.\n“My phone should be able to tell me which bus and train to take,” said Kenan Ali, a Brooklyn, New York, resident who exclusively uses public transport in the city and has been an iPhone user since 2008. “I am hoping in the next update they will somehow add transit directions.”\nApple’s map service comes with three-dimensional images of cities called “Flyover” along with real-time traffic updates and also turn-by-turn navigation, the last a feature that Google has in Android devices but had not made available in Apple devices.\nApple licenses mapping data from vehicle navigation systems maker TomTom. TomTom said it stands behind the quality of its maps but didn’t develop the app.\n“During the process of turning mapping data into an app, every manufacturer does it their own way,” said TomTom spokesperson Cem Cohen. “We are not part of that process. Apple uses exactly the same maps as our other customers.”\nCohen said TomTom hasn’t talked to Apple about the issues.\nWhile in theory it will be possible for Apple to update Maps with a software fix, the problems appear to be “pretty profound and pretty fundamental,” said Marcus Thielking, co-founder of Skobbler, maker of the popular GPS Navigation 2 app, built using the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap platform.\n“The question is really how much expertise do they have in-house and what they sourced from third parties,” Thielking said, adding that Apple requires people with a very specific skill set to fix it.\n“It’s not their core competence,” he added.\nGoogle, for its part, did not say whether it would do a Google Maps apps for iOS 6. Users now have to access Google Maps through the browser.\n“Our goal is to make Google Maps available to everyone who wants to use it, regardless of device, browser, or operating system,” the company said in a statement.\nApple shares closed down about 0.5 percent at $698.70 on Nasdaq, a day after reaching an all-time high of $703.99.

{"num":24,"Time":"SEPTEMBER 25, 2008","Title":"Tele Atlas to offer TomTom traffic data to clients","Content":"By Harro ten Wolde, Niclas Mika\nAMSTERDAM, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Digital map maker Tele Atlas says it is to start selling its parent car navigation device maker TomTom's TOM2.AS data on driving conditions to other makers of navigation devices, expecting to win new customers and generate more sales from existing clients.\nTomTom has gathered extensive data from customers’ devices, equivalent to driving the road network of Europe and North America 2,000 times, tracking how fast it is possible to drive on a road at a given time.\nTele Atlas, which was taken over by TomTom for 2.9 billion euros ($4.25 billion) this year, said the data will make it possible to route drivers differently depending on the day of the week and time of day.\n“The database allows you to drive with local knowledge even though you are not a local,” Tele Atlas chief executive Bill Henry told Reuters.\nIt will be sold as an additional feature to Tele Atlas's core products and the company hopes it will give it a competitive edge over Navteq, the only other map supplier with a global reach, which has been bought by the world's largest cell phone maker Nokia NOK1V.HE.\n“You have to differentiate on things that are difficult to copy,” Henry said. “You cannot buy this product from anybody else.”\nThe TomTom database contains speed profiles, derived from half a trillion automatic speed measurements that TomTom customers have been sharing over the past two years.\nIt may also find uses beyond car navigation, Henry said.\n“If you think of local governments and the people who are responsible for street networks -- today people spend huge amounts of money (...) to try and capture traffic volumes, speed and all of that.

{"num":1,"Time":"6 July 2018","Title":"What tech giants really do with your data","Content":"What tech giants really do with your data\nPublished\n6 July 2018\nShare\nMedia caption,\nChildren baffled by Instagram and YouTube terms\nBy Tom Calver and Joe Miller\nBBC News\nTracking your phone's gyroscope, scanning your messages and giving your data to third-party companies.\nThese are just three of the things you agree to when signing up to some tech companies' apps and sites.\nBBC research has found some of the language used in privacy policies and terms requires a university education to be understood.\nBut dig down beneath the jargon, and there are some surprising realities about how your data is used.\n1. Your location is tracked - even if you don't allow it\nMany apps ask permission to track your precise location through your phone's Global Positioning System (GPS), which users can refuse.\nBut even if you refuse the app permission, they can still see where you are.\nFacebook, for example, collects location-related information aside from your phone's GPS. It still tracks where you are through IP addresses, \"check-ins or events you attend\".\nTwitter also \"requires\" information about your current location, \"which we get from signals such as your IP address or device settings\". This is so it can \"securely and reliably set up and maintain your account\".\nGmail messages 'read by human third parties'\nFacebook reveals its data-sharing VIPs\nApple jams Facebook's web-hacking tools\n2. Companies pass your data to affiliates...\nWhen you agree to terms and conditions, you often don't just give your data to that specific app - there's a lot of intra-group data sharing.\nFor example, the data that dating app Tinder collects is shared with other members of the Match Group, which includes other dating sites OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and Match.com.\nTinder says it does so for \"maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising\", and to remove users who violate their terms of use.\nElsewhere, LinkedIn was bought by Microsoft in 2016, and according to its privacy policy, receives data \"about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our affiliates, including Microsoft.\"\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\n3. ...and you're also bound by third-party terms\nIf having to read the tech giant's terms itself wasn't enough, you might also have to read those of other companies that deal with your data.\nAmazon says they may share your information with third parties: as well as their own terms, users should \"carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use\".\nOr, if you use Apple products, your personal data is shared with companies \"who provide services such as information processing, extending credit [...] and assessing your interest in our products and services\".\nThe EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May, does not order companies to list these third parties in their terms.\nHowever, Ailidh Callander, legal officer at Privacy International, a charity, says this has worrying implications: \"It means that companies like data brokers are able to use your location, your interests, your contacts and much more to profile you.\n\"Privacy policies can be overwhelming, but it is really important to take the time to look not only at what data is being collected and why, but also who it is being shared with (and for what purposes)\", she adds.\nWikipedia, on the other hand, does not share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. Their terms also make a point of saying how they \"don't allow tracking by third-party websites you have not visited\".\n4. Tinder collects gyroscope data\nSometimes data collection goes beyond name, age and location.\nTinder says that the app collects data from your phone's accelerometers (for measuring movement), gyroscopes (which measure the angle you're holding your phone at), and compasses.\nIt doesn't, however, say exactly what that data is used for.\n5. Facebook keeps your deleted searches...\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nFacebook offers the option to delete searches from their history, giving the user the impression that records of their searches are wiped clean.\nThe problem, however, is that they aren't.\nTheir data policy states that while search history can be deleted at any time, \"the log of that search is deleted after 6 months\".\n6. ...and tracks you even if you're off the app\nFacebook even tracks what you do when you're not signed in to it - or when you don't have an account.\nAccording to its data policy, it works with \"advertisers, app developers and publishers\", who can send them information \"about your activities off Facebook\", through something called Facebook Business Tools.\nThese partners \"provide information about your activities off Facebook - including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, [and] the ads you see\".\nThis happens \"whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook\".\n7. LinkedIn scans your private messages\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nIf you thought private messages were private, think again.\nLinkedIn uses \"automatic scanning technology on messages\", according to its privacy policy.\nThe company says it does this in order to provide protection from malicious sites or spam, and to suggest automatic replies.\nTwitter, meanwhile, stores and processes your messages.\nIt uses data about \"whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform.\"\n8. And if you're under 18, your parents should have read this with you\nApple's terms say that \"children under the age of majority should review this Agreement with their parent or guardian to ensure that the child and parent or legal guardian understand it.\"\nYet as BBC research found, to sit through and read their privacy policy and terms would take the average adult more than 40 minutes - let alone the average 13-year-old.\nAnd if reading the privacy policy once wasn't enough, Amazon invites you back to check again: \"Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Notice will change also. You should check our website frequently to see recent changes.\"\n9. Don't use your iPhone to make nuclear weapons\nFinally, Apple has a line in its UK terms of use telling customers not to use their products \"for any purposes prohibited by United States law\".\nAccording to their definition, that includes \"without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, missile or chemical or biological weapons\".\nMore on this story\nGmail messages 'read by third parties'\nPublished\n3 July 2018\nFacebook reveals its data-share VIPs\nPublished\n2 July 2018\nApple jams Facebook's web-tracking tools\nPublished\n4 June 2018","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": [\n    \"Your location is tracked - even if you don't allow it\",\n    \"Many apps ask permission to track your precise location through your phone's GPS, which users can refuse.

This is just another form of selling.\"\nThe Irish Data Protection Commission, which takes the lead on Facebook in the EU, has issued a brief statement: \"We are aware of the media reporting from earlier today. We are currently assessing what next steps, if any, are required.\"\nAnalysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nGETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nSome believe Mark Zuckerberg should allow someone else to be appointed Facebook's chairman or chairwoman\nFacebook, as ever, thinks it's being unfairly picked on. Indeed, as recently as this week, former security boss Alex Stamos described the Cambridge Analytica scandal as an overreaction.\nWith its statement on Wednesday, Facebook took the same tone it has since this whole mess began in March: users gave consent, everybody knew, nothing to see here.\nFor added cheekiness, its statement linked to a piece in the New York Times from 2010 that seemed to reference at least one of the features revealed in this latest investigation.\nBut what Facebook underestimates, continually, is the extent to which this year has produced a \"data-awakening\" among the general public, and how now is the time for the company to lay it all out on the table.\nIf I was a Facebook employee, or shareholder, I'd be telling Mark Zuckerberg: \"It's time to be completely open about who has or had access to data.\"\nThat's the only way to stop 2019 being like 2018: a drip-drip of headlines that have eroded Facebook's reputation, perhaps irreparably.\nWho got what?\nThe NYT bases its analysis on hundreds of pages of documents and dozens of interviews, the full details of which it has not shared.\nIn total, it said the social network had special arrangements with more than 150 companies to share its members' personal data. Most of these, it said, were other tech firms, but the list also included online retailers, car-makers and media organisations, including the NYT itself, among others.\nOf the examples given it reported:\nMicrosoft's Bing search engine was able to see the names of \"virtually all\" Facebook users' friends without those friends' consent in order to personalise the results it showed\nThe music-streaming service Pandora and film review platform Rotten Tomatoes also had access to friends' information in order to customise their results\nApple devices could access the contact numbers and calendar entries of users even if they had disabled all sharing in their Facebook settings. Moreover, it said Apple's devices did not need to alert users to the fact they were seeking data from Facebook\nNetflix, Spotify and the Royal Bank of Canada were able to read, write and delete users' private messages and see all participants on a chat thread\nRussian search provider Yandex was allowed to index users' identities from public pages and posts to improve its search results after Facebook stopped other applicants from continuing the activity\nYahoo could view live feeds of friends' posts\nSony, Microsoft and Amazon could access members' email addresses via their friends\nBlackberry and Huawei were among companies that could pull Facebook's data to power their own social media apps\nFacebook has long maintained that it does not sell its users' data.\nBut the NYT said that one of the arrangements it struck was to get contact lists from Amazon, Yahoo and Huawei, which it used to run its own People You May Know facility.\nThe feature suggests more acquaintances users might want to add to their friends, which helps increase engagement.\nWhat is Facebook's response?\nThe firm distinguishes between two different types of relationships it formed.\nThe first type it calls \"integration partnerships\". It defines these as arrangements that allowed others to offer Facebook's features outside of its own app or website.\nFacebook actually provided a long list of such partners to Congress in July.\nIt said the arrangement made it possible for other companies to do things like consolidate posts from Facebook, Twitter and other social media providers in a single app, or provide alerts from a range of services via a web browser.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nFACEBOOK\nImage caption,\nFacebook says that the integration partnerships allowed the BlackBerry Hub and other similar services to be possible\nBut it noted that to do this, its members had to have signed into their Facebook accounts to give permission. It added that \"nearly all\" of these partnerships had been shut down in recent months.\nFacebook refers to the second type of arrangements as being \"instant personalisation\".\nIt said these allowed other apps to see Facebook's private messages so that, for example you could send a song recommendation to a friend without having to leave Spotify's app.\nThe facility also ensured that if you deleted a message within a third-party app, it was also deleted in Facebook.\n\"No third party was reading your private messages, or writing messages to your friends without your permission,\" added Facebook's product partnership chief Ime Archibong in a blog.\n\"Many news stories imply we were shipping over private messages to partners, which is not correct.\"\nFacebook said that users' public information was also shared so that, for example, you could see what TV shows your friends had watched within Netflix.\nFacebook said that for the most part, it ended its personalisation partnerships in 2014, but continued in some select cases into 2017.\nIt acknowledged, however, that it had not always withdrawn the application programming interfaces (APIs) that allowed others to tap into its data, as it should have.\n\"We're in the midst of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them,\" it concluded.\nWhat have the other firms said?\nMicrosoft has issued a brief statement saying: \"Throughout our engagement with Facebook, we respected all user preferences.\"\nThe BBC understands it ended its Bing contract with Facebook in February 2016, and the social network's data stopped appearing in its search results at that point.\nNetflix has said that it stopped taking advantage of its ability to recommend content to members' Facebook friends in 2015 as the service had not been popular.\nIMAGE SOURCE,\nFACEBOOK\nImage caption,\nNetflix used to let users send messages to Facebook friends from within its service\n\"At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so,\" it added.\nSpotify had indicated it was unaware of the degree of access Facebook had provided to it. Apple has also said that it was also not aware of its devices being granted special access.\nYahoo said it only tapped into Facebook's data once users had opted in, and did not do so for advertising purposes.\nYandex has said its arrangement was limited to users in Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, and added that it stopped receiving Facebook's data in 2015.\nAmazon said it only used Facebook's information \"in accordance with our privacy policy\".\nWhy does this matter?\nPart of the issue is that Facebook promised a US regulator - the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - in 2011 that it would not share user data without explicit consent.\nFacebook insists it has not breached that pledge, but some privacy experts suggest otherwise.\nFurthermore, despite Facebook executives claiming to have been transparent over the years about the firm's privacy policy shifts, campaign groups suggest new laws are needed to restrict its activities.\n\"Time and again Facebook has been unable to clearly and in plain language explain to people how the company is collecting, storing, sharing, and retaining people's data,\" a spokeswoman for Privacy International told the BBC.\n\"The sheer scope of the Facebook scandals in 2018 alone is mind-boggling and shows that data exploitation is a rampant and systemic.\"\nThe other risk is that the more negative stories there are in the press, the more likely users are to quit Facebook and its other apps - including Instagram and WhatsApp - or at least stop sharing personal information with them.\nSkip twitter post 2 by Cher\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter.

{"num":11,"Time":"Tue 6 May 2014 13.53 CEST","Title":"Moves app changes policy to allow data sharing with new owner Facebook","Content":"Eleven days after being purchased by Facebook, the activity tracking app Moves has changed its privacy policy to allow it to share user data with its parent company.\nThe new version of the app's privacy policy allows it to \"share information, including personally identifying information, with our affiliates (companies that are part of our corporate groups of companies, including but not limited to Facebook)\".\nMoves uses motion sensors inside Apple and Android phones, as well as GPS information, to track a user's location and activity throughout the day. Not only does its information include someone's whereabouts, down to which building they were in when they started using the service, it even knows if they travelled between locations on foot, bike or bus.\nOn the day of its acquisition, the company promised users that \"the Moves experience will continue to operate as a standalone app, and there are no plans to change that or commingle data with Facebook\".

The records would be scraped from every patient in England registered to a GP clinic by NHS Digital, which runs the country’s healthcare IT systems.\nThe Doctors’ Association UK (DAUK), a campaigning and lobbying organisation comprised of doctors, said it was concerned this would “erode the doctor\/patient relationship, leaving patients reluctant to share their problems due to fears of where their data will be shared”.\nDr Ellen Welch, a GP and the editorial leader of DAUK, said: “NHS Digital has failed to publicise this adequately to patients or healthcare staff, and we feel more time is needed to explain to patients how exactly their data will be used, who will benefit from it and what implications it may have for individuals.”\nProf Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), said it supported the principle of improved sharing of data for important healthcare planning and research, but it was “critical that this is transparent and that patients have confidence and trust in how the NHS and other bodies might use their information”.\nHe said the RCGP and the British Medical Association were engaged with the planning of the new data collection, adding it would continue to lobby “NHS Digital to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for how the data collected is used”.\n\nMarshall said: “The job of informing the public must not be left to busy GPs, especially at a time of extreme workload pressures and focus on the Covid-19 vaccination programme, so we have written to NHS Digital urging them to undertake greater communications with the public about this new collection and their options for opting out.”\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, first announced the plan in April via blog posts on the NHS Digital website and flyers at GP surgeries.\nHowever, the advocacy group MedConfidential told the Financial Times: ‘They’re trying to sneak it out, they are giving you six weeks nominally and if you do not act based on webpages on the NHS Digital site and some YouTube videos and a few tweets, your entire GP history could have been scraped, never to be deleted.”\nThe data will be anonymised and given “codes” that can be used to reveal the identity of the data’s owners if there is a “valid legal reason”. Privacy campaigners have said the plans are “legally problematic” and patients have been given a limited window to opt out. The deadline for opting out is 23 June and can be done by patients completing a form and giving it to their family doctor.\n\nThe digital rights campaign group Foxglove has written to the Department of Health and Social Care. “Very few members of the public will be aware that the new processing is imminent, directly affecting their personal medical data,” their solicitor, Rosa Curling, said in the letter.\nA spokesperson for the British Medical Association said it was engaged in the planning for the collection and “made representations on behalf of GP practices” to “ensure stronger arrangements were put in place over the security and intended uses of the data collected, and to minimise administrative burden for practices”.\n“We will continue to hold NHS Digital to account,” they said.\nThe UK’s data regulator is reportedly producing a data protection impact assessment about the plans.\nAn NHS Digital spokesperson said: “Patient data is already used every day to plan and improve healthcare services, for research that results in better treatments, and to save lives.\n“During the pandemic, data from GPs has been used to benefit millions of us: helping to identify and protect those most vulnerable, roll out our world-leading vaccine programme, and identify hospital treatments which have prevented people dying from Covid.\n“We have engaged with doctors, patients, data, privacy and ethics experts to design and build a better system for collecting this data. The data will only be used for health and care planning and research purposes, by organisations which can show they have an appropriate legal basis and a legitimate need to use it.”\nThey added: “We are exploring further options to expand our communications approach and remain committed to being transparent with patients and the public about the collection and use of data.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": [\n        \"Doctors have warned that plans to pool medical records on to a database and share them with third parties could erode the relationship between them and patients.\",\n        \"Critics have voiced concerns over the NHS Digital plans, which would put the medical histories of more than 55 million patients into a database available to academic and commercial third parties for research and planning purposes.\",\n        \"Privacy campaigners have already spoken out against the proposals, which include sharing anonymized mental and sexual health data, criminal records, and more sensitive information.\",\n        \"The Doctors’ Association UK (DAUK) expressed concern that this would erode the doctor\/patient relationship, leaving patients reluctant to share their problems due to fears of where their data will be shared.\",\n        \"The data will be anonymized and given 'codes' that can be used to reveal the identity of the data’s owners if there is a 'valid legal reason'.\",\n        \"Privacy campaigners have said the plans are 'legally problematic' and patients have been given a limited window to opt out.\"\n    ]\n}\nThe news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage as it discusses concerns and criticisms related to the sharing of medical records and sensitive information with third parties, the potential erosion of the doctor-patient relationship, and the privacy implications of the data being shared.","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2021\/may\/30\/gps-warn-plans-share-patient-data-third-parties-england","query_name":"updated_file_Third-party_Location_Data_Sharing.xlsx"}
{"num":12,"Time":"Fri 16 Apr 2021 11.22 CEST","Title":"Google location data: what does Australian court ruling mean and how can I turn off my tracking history?","Content":"If you have ever used Google Maps on your phone without fiddling with the location settings, it goes without saying that the tech giant knows everywhere you’ve been. The really bad news is that even if you have previously tried to stop Google tracking your every movement, the company may have done so anyway.\nOn Friday the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) won a legal action in the federal court, which ruled that, thanks to a peculiar set-up that required a user to check “No” or “Do Not Collect” to both “Location History” and “Web & App Activity” on some Android and Pixel phones, someone who ticked “No” to just one would still end up being tracked.\nWe asked Dr Katharine Kemp, a legal academic from the University of New South Wales whose focus is consumer law, and the Australian cryptographer Vanessa Teague for their thoughts on the significance of the decision and how a person might go about securing their devices.\nWhat does the ruling mean for you?\nKemp, an Apple user herself, says that for many consumers, today’s decision may not actually mean much, as the decision only related to Android users and Google has since updated the settings that formed the basis of the ACCC’s complaint.\nGoogle ‘partially’ misled consumers over collecting location data, Australian court finds\nRead more\n“In the bigger picture the consumers can feel better that the ACCC is taking some action to protect consumers where big tech companies take advantage of their privacy,” Kemp said.\nTeague, meanwhile, said that while the ACCC was “right” to pursue Google over the confusing nature of the dual settings, sharing information with any large tech company was always a risk.\n“Wifi and Bluetooth-based location services, including services like Google and Baidu, are inherently non-private – you’re sending your info to some big tech company and asking them where you are,” Teague says. “It’s not really meaningful to talk about privacy after that, though the companies vary in how shamelessly they share, sell or exploit the info.”\nStill, Teague had some basic tips for how Android users may double check the settings on their phone.\nFamiliarise yourself with your account settings\nThe settings are different depending on which system you are running. On an Android phone, you will find your account privacy settings under the “Settings” tab. From there, find the “Accounts” section and select your Google account. Scroll down to the section tagged “Mange your data & personalization” and select it. This will offer a range of settings that you can review for various activities in order to prevent your location from being shared with Google.\nTurn off Bluetooth scanning\nTeague says it is a good idea to police other basic functions like Bluetooth. Unless you’re actively using it to play music through devices like wireless headphones, turn off the Bluetooth function and don’t let your phone automatically scan for Bluetooth connections as this can be used to track you. You can find this under the “Location” tab in the Settings section on an Android phone. Tap “Improve Accuracy” and you will have the option to stop your phone from letting apps use wifi and Bluetooth scanning.\nThe same can be achieved on iPhones by navigating to “Settings” then tapping “Privacy” and finding the “Location Settings” tab. From there you can turn off location settings for specific apps. Scrolling down further to “System Services” will allow you to find the “Significant Locations” function that logs a record of where you been. From here you can toggle it off.\nHave download discipline\nThe final thing is small but important: have good download discipline. While changing your Google settings is a good start, third-party apps can also track you if you’re not careful. This is also true of any personal assistants such as Siri or Google Assistant and users should also be sure to check those settings.\nGenerally speaking, however, Teague says the rule is simple: don’t download random apps when you don’t need to and make sure not to give them permissions they shouldn’t have. Under the “Privacy” tab in settings you will find the “Permissions manager” tab, which will allow you to see which apps have what permissions. Tap on any app and you’ll be able to change the settings.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems about location information leakage.

{"num":24,"Time":"AUGUST 20, 2010","Title":"Facebook Places: What You Need To Know","Content":"By\n6 MIN READ\nAs expected, Facebook on Wednesday launched its new location-sharing feature called Places. Similar to other location-based services such as Gowalla and MyTown, it allows you to signal your presence at a bar, restaurant, arena, or other location via Facebook. The social network’s focus appears to be on simply sharing your location with your friends as opposed to including gaming elements or promotional check-in incentives that you find with other location services such as Foursquare\nPlaces promises to be an interesting addition to Facebook, and could increase the popularity of location sharing in general. But before you start checking in to every restaurant, movie theater, and bar you visit, here’s what you need to know.\nPlaces Basics\nAt launch, Places will be available to U.S. users only. You can check into a location in two ways: through the Facebook iPhone application or by pointing your mobile browser to touch.facebook.com. The browser-based version of Places will work only if your device supports HTML5 and geolocation.\nJust tap the Places icon and you’ll see a list of nearby Places. Tap on your location from the list, and you can check in, tag any friends who are with you, and add a status update. When you tag a friend, you will be checking them in if they allow third party check-ins. If your friend doesn’t allow third party check-ins, then tagging them will be just like tagging them in a status update. No actual check-in will happen.\nYou can only check in people who are on your Facebook friends list and only when you first check into a location yourself. You can see who else is at your location under the “People Here Now” section for that place.\nFacebook says all Places check-ins are visible only to friends by default unless your master privacy control is set to “Everyone.”\nFor more detailed information about Places, consult PC World’s report from Facebook’s Places launch event. You can also find more information in this Facebook blog post and the Places information page.\nPlays Nice With Others\nFacebook has decided not to wipe other location-based services off the face of the Earth. Instead these services can use Places to enhance their own offerings.\nIt’s not entirely clear how this will work, but Gowalla Chief Technical Officer Scott Raymond said in an interview with VentureBeat that Gowalla’s plan was to allow users to push their check-ins from Gowalla into Facebook’s Places feature. It appears you will also be able to import your check-in badges, pins, and Gowalla passport stamps into Facebook.\nBing Maps\nIt should come as no surprise that Facebook is using Microsoft’s Bing Maps to pinpoint locations in Places.\nMicrosoft made a considerable investment in Facebook several years ago, and other Microsoft services such as Bing search and Microsoft Docs are already integrated with Facebook.\nNot Yet Fully Functional\nSome have reported seeing messages that Places is not yet available in their area, while others say they can activate Places but the check-in function is not operational.\nIf you’re experiencing similar problems, hold tight the functionality is coming soon. Facebook is slowly rolling out the service and will make it available across the U.S. over the next few days, according to TechCrunch.\nThe Onslaught Begins Thursday\nFacebook says it plans on turning on the Read API for third-party functionality on Thursday. What that means is that third-party services will be able to read your check-ins when you interact with those apps as well as the check-ins of people on your friends list (if their privacy settings allow it), according to programmableweb.\nAny third-party application that wants to use your check-in data must specifically ask you for it when you authorize the app, according to Facebook. However, be aware of some downsides.\nIt appears there’s no way to deny access to your Places data and still use the application. So if you want to use an application that requires your Places data, you either must deny the application completely or accept the fact that the application will be harvesting your location data. You can find out more about Facebook’s privacy permissions here.\nPrivacy Concerns\nThe first criticisms over Places and privacy appear to be from the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. The civil rights group doesn’t like the fact that there isn’t a flat out “No” option to stop friends from checking you in.\nIf someone checks you in at a location, you receive a mobile notification that a friend has checked you in. Then you must decide to either permanently authorize third-party check-ins or deny them by selecting “not now,” according to the ACLUNC. The concern is that by selecting “not now,” the request to authorize third-party check-ins may come up again and again until you finally say yes. Also, if you use Places to check yourself in, then third-party check-ins are turned on automatically unless you adjust your privacy settings, according to the ACLUNC.\nThe ACLUNC also says that the “People Here Now” feature doesn’t have enough granular control. The feature only has an option to be turned on (everyone can see your check-in) or turned off (no one can see your check-in). The ACLUNC would prefer to see an option that allows only your friends to see you under the ” People Here Now” feature. It also appears that “People Here Now” is turned on by default “if you have previously selected that “Everyone” can see even a single piece of your information,” according to the ACLUNC.\nHave you tried Places yet?

{"num":33,"Time":"4 minute read\nUpdated 10:28 AM EDT, Thu June 8, 2023","Title":"Analysis: There is now some public evidence that China viewed TikTok data","Content":"CNN\n — \nUS officials have long insisted the Chinese government may be able to view the personal information of TikTok users — but that claim was purely speculative. Until now.\nIn what appears to be a first, a former employee of ByteDance, TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company, has outlined specific claims that the Chinese Communist Party accessed the data of TikTok users on a broad scale, and for political purposes.\nIn a court filing this week, the former employee of ByteDance, Yintao Yu, alleged that the CCP spied on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2018 by using “backdoor” access to TikTok to identify and monitor the activists’ locations and communications.\nMultiple security experts told CNN that this appears to be the first reported allegation of the CCP accessing actual TikTok user data. The explosive claim, which ByteDance disputes, could inflame a global debate over whether TikTok poses a security threat and whether policymakers are right to ban the short-form video app.\nUS venture capital titan Sequoia to split off China business amid tension with Beijing\nThe evidence, such as it is, remains rather thin. It is a sworn statement by Yu, who is suing ByteDance in a wrongful termination case in California state court. The declaration does not provide documentation, internal messages or other primary source materials to substantiate the claim.\nBut Yu, who pledged under penalty of perjury that he is telling the truth, alleges he viewed access logs showing that CCP officials — whom Yu described as part of a special “committee” with dedicated physical access to ByteDance’s Beijing offices — used a so-called “god credential” to bypass any privacy protections the company may have otherwise applied to the TikTok data.\n“The Committee and external investigators used the god credential to identify and locate the Hong Kong protestors, civil rights activists, and supporters of the protests,” Yu alleged in the filing. “From the logs, I saw that the Committee accessed the protestors’, civil rights activists’, and supporters’ unique user data, locations, and communications.”\nThe filing was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\nTikTok declined to comment on the allegation. In a statement, a ByteDance spokesperson sought to discredit Yu’s claims as an opportunistic publicity grab.\n“We plan to vigorously oppose what we believe are baseless claims and allegations in this complaint,” the statement said, adding that Yu’s employment at a ByteDance app known as Flipagram was terminated in 2018 after working for the company for less than a year. “It’s curious that Mr. Yu has never raised these allegations in the five years since his employment for Flipagram was terminated in July 2018. His actions are clearly intended to garner media attention.”\nTypes of data that the CCP may have accessed, Yu suggests, include device identifiers, network information such as IP addresses and users’ direct messages, along with search and browsing histories. TikTok announced its withdrawal from Hong Kong in 2020 after China imposed a national security law there.\nJames Lewis, an information security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and John Scott-Railton, an information security expert at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, both agreed that Yu’s claim appears to be the first to identify a specific circumstance where the CCP has actually accessed TikTok data.\nThere have been isolated reports of improper access to TikTok data in the past. Most notably, ByteDance has acknowledged having fired a number of employees who sought to access account information belonging to several journalists. The improper access, company officials have said, was a misguided attempt at identifying the source of leaks to the press.\nThat situation appeared to have been limited to several individuals, however, and did not appear to involve agents working on behalf of the CCP. By contrast, US officials have characterized their suspicions of TikTok in much broader terms, describing fears of the Chinese government using TikTok data to inform large-scale intelligence gathering operations or to promote disinformation campaigns at a societal level.\nWhen Rob Joyce, the National Security Agency’s director of cybersecurity, was asked by reporters in December to articulate his security concerns about TikTok, he offered a general warning about the potential for harm rather than a specific allegation.\n“People are always looking for the smoking gun in these technologies,” Joyce said. “I characterize it much more as a loaded gun.”\nTikTok CEO Shou Chew previously told US lawmakers that the company has never been asked by the Chinese government for data on its US users, and would never comply with such a request. TikTok has also said it is implementing a plan to store US user data on third-party US-based servers, with access to that data controlled by US employees. The company is moving to implement a similar solution for European data.\nBut Chew and other TikTok officials have also balked at answering specific questions about the nature of TikTok’s relationship to ByteDance or ByteDance’s relationship to the Chinese government.\nThe allegations by Yu concerning Hong Kong dissidents are much closer in nature to the type of concerns raised by the US government. They imply the direct interference of Chinese officials in the business operations of a private company, ultimately leading to broad-based surveillance intended to shut down democratic activity.\nYu’s claims have still yet to be proven. But they provide a rare, if not the first, substantive accusation of what many have hypothesized as merely a possibility.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"A former employee of ByteDance, Yintao Yu, alleged that the Chinese Communist Party accessed the data of TikTok users on a broad scale for political purposes.\",\n\"Yu claims that CCP spied on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2018 by using 'backdoor' access to TikTok to identify and monitor the activists’ locations and communications.\",\n\"CCP officials used a 'god credential' to bypass privacy protections applied to TikTok data, accessing unique user data, locations, and communications.\",\n\"Types of data that the CCP may have accessed include device identifiers, network information, direct messages, and search and browsing histories.\",\n\"Information security experts James Lewis and John Scott-Railton agreed that Yu’s claim appears to be the first to identify a specific circumstance where the CCP has actually accessed TikTok data.\"\n]\n}","From":"cnn.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/06\/08\/tech\/tiktok-data-china\/index.html","query_name":"updated_file_Third-party_Location_Data_Sharing.xlsx"}

{"num":41,"Time":"5 minute read\nUpdated 12:11 PM EDT, Fri June 22, 2018","Title":"Supreme Court: Warrant generally needed to track cell phone location data","Content":"Washington\nCNN\n — \nThe Supreme Court on Friday said the government generally needs a warrant if it wants to track an individual’s location through cell phone records over an extended period of time.\nThe ruling is a major victory for advocates of increased privacy rights who argued more protections were needed when it comes to the government obtaining information from a third party such as a cell phone company.\nThe 5-4 opinion in Carpenter v. United States, was written by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the four most liberal justices.\nIt is a loss for the Justice Department, which had argued that an individual has diminished privacy rights when it comes to information that has been voluntarily shared with someone else.\nThe opinion, which was limited to cell-site location data, continues a recent trend at the court to boost privacy rights in the digital era and clarifies court precedent as it applies to data held by a third party.\nCell phones play a “pervasive and insistent part of daily life,” Roberts wrote.\n“Virtually any activity on the phone generates” the data, Roberts said, “including incoming calls, texts, or e-mails and countless other data connections that a phone automatically makes when checking for news, weather, or social media updates.”\n“Here the progress of science has afforded law enforcement a powerful new tool to carry out its important responsibilities,” Roberts added. At the same time, he said, “this tool risks Government encroachment of the sort the Framers after consulting the lessons of history, drafted the Fourth Amendment to prevent.”\nHe noted, however, that there would be exceptions to the need for a warrant, including pursuing suspects or protecting individuals threatened with imminent harm.\nSteve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the ruling “could portend a revolution in how courts understand and enforce privacy rights in the digital age.”\n“For 40 years, the assumption has been that individuals have no expectation of privacy in any information we voluntarily share with third parties – from phone records to bank statements to how and where we buy and sell goods,” Vladeck said.\n“Even though today’s ruling argues that cell-site location data is unique, it’s easy to see how it will open the door to countless other contexts in which privacy advocates and criminal defendants will argue for similar privacy protections - and similar warrant requirements,” he added, saying to watch Roberts in the future.\n“Today’s decision also suggests that the chief justice, who sided with he four Democratic appointees in the 5-4 ruling, is increasingly becoming the court’s swing vote on questions of digital privacy,” Vladeck said.\nACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler called the decision “a groundbreaking victory for Americans’ privacy rights in the digital age.” He added, “The Supreme Court has given privacy law an update that it has badly needed for many years, finally bringing it in line with the realities of modern life.”\nThe Supreme Court returns Monday for the final week of the term, when it is expected to rule on cases including President Donald Trump’s travel ban, Texas redistricting and a California abortion notice law.\nThe dissent\nWhile the majority opinion covered 23 pages, the dissents covered a total of 92.\nNot only did four Republican-appointed justices, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissent, each chose to write their own opinion, some of which, were joined by others.\nKennedy wrote a dissent joined by Thomas and Alito and said that the Court’s departure from precedent was “unnecessary, and incorrect.”\nKennedy in his dissent said the majority’s opinion “puts needed, reasonable, accepted, lawful and congressionally authorized criminal investigations at serious risk in serious cases, often when law enforcement seeks to prevent the threat of violent crimes.” He also said that it places “undue restrictions” on the “lawful and necessary enforcement powers exercised not only by the Federal government, but also by law enforcement in every State and locality throughout the nation.”\nKennedy also argued that “Cell-site records, however, are no different from the many other kinds of business records the Government has a lawful right to obtain by compulsory process.\n“Customers … do not own, possess, control, or use the records, and for that reason have no reasonable expectation that they cannot be disclosed pursuant to lawful compulsory process,” he added.\nAlito, who was joined by Thomas, in a 27-page dissent said he feared the majority opinion would do “more harm than good.”\n“The Court’s reasoning fractures two fundamental pillars of Fourth Amendment law, and in doing so, it guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.”\nArmed robberies spurred case\nThe case came after a string of armed robberies at Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores in Michigan and Ohio.\nA robber who confessed to the crimes gave the FBI his own cellphone number and the numbers of other participants in the robbery scheme. Pursuant to the Stored Communications Act, a law that authorizes the government to obtain cell service provider’s records under certain circumstances, the FBI obtained cell-site records placing Timothy Carpenter and Timothy Sanders near each of the robberies.\nCarpenter and Sanders were later charged with aiding and abetting robbery.\nLawyers for the defendants moved to suppress the cell-site evidence arguing that the “reasonable grounds” standard necessary for the information under the federal law was too low a standard of proof. Instead, they argued that the Fourth Amendment required the government to obtain a search warrant pursuant to a showing of probable cause before obtaining the data.\nA federal appeals court ruled in favor of the government, holding that while the Fourth Amendment “protects the content of the modern-day letter,” courts have not yet “extended those protections to the internet analogue to envelope markings, namely the metadata used to route internet communications, like sender and recipient addresses on email, or IP addresses.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about location information leakage.

The ruling is specific to cell-site location data and is seen as a significant development in how courts understand and enforce privacy rights in the digital age.\"\n}","From":"cnn.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/06\/22\/politics\/supreme-court-ruling-cell-phone\/index.html","query_name":"updated_file_Third-party_Location_Data_Sharing.xlsx"}

REUTERS\/Michael Dalder\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc has removed an experimental privacy feature from its Android mobile software that had allowed users to block apps from collecting personal information such as address book data and a user’s location.\nThe change means that owners of smartphones using Android 4.4.2, the latest version of the world’s most popular operating system for mobile devices released this week, must provide access to their personal data in order to use certain apps.\nA company spokesman said the feature had been included by accident in Android 4.3, the version released last summer.\n“We are suspicious of this explanation, and do not think that it in any way justifies removing the feature rather than improving it,” said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The digital rights website first publicized the change in a blog post on Friday.\nAndroid users who wish to retain the privacy controls by not upgrading to Android 4.4.2 could be vulnerable to security risks, Eckersley said. “For the time being, users will need to chose between either privacy or security on the Android devices, but not both.”\nMany third-party apps for Android devices, such as music-identifying service Shazam and popular smartphone flashlight apps, require access to personal information that does not always have an obvious connection to the app’s functionality, such as phone call information and location data.\nThe privacy feature allowed users to pick and choose which personal data a third-party app can collect, Eckersley said. Users had to install a special Apps Ops Launcher software, which was created by another company, in order to access the hidden privacy controls.\nAndroid software was loaded on 81 percent of all smartphones shipped worldwide in the third quarter, according to industry research firm IDC. Apple Inc’s iOS, the software used on the iPhone, had 12.9 percent market share.\nPrivacy has become an increasingly important issue as smartphones, which are loaded with consumers’ personal information, become the primary computing device for many consumers. In November Google agreed to pay a $17 million fine to settle allegations that it secretly tracked Web users by placing special digital files on the Web browsers of their smartphones.\nReporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Richard Chang\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": \"Google Inc has removed an experimental privacy feature from its Android mobile software that had allowed users to block apps from collecting personal information such as address book data and a user’s location.\"\n}\nThe news is relevant because it discusses Google removing a privacy feature from its Android mobile software, which allowed users to block apps from collecting personal information, including location data.

It can infer if you’ve had a miscarriage, if you put in a pregnancy and then that data stops being collected.\nBower said while the apps may be sold as a health service, they might be more interested in the data collection.

Bower said the app developers could be required as part of legal requests to hand over the data held.\nWhile Choice said it was not perfect, the survey found the Natural Cycles app was the best of those examined, providing clear and concise privacy summaries, allowing users to opt out of data being used for research, not sharing data, and allowing users to request for their data to be deleted.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": [\n    \"Fertility apps collect unnecessary personal data and could sell it to third parties – study\",\n    \"Four of Australia’s top 12 fertility apps are unnecessarily collecting highly sensitive information and have left the door open to selling the data to other companies, a study has found.\",\n    \"Choice found the privacy policy of BabyCenter allowed the company to collect information about its users through other companies and data brokers, as well as sell personal data to other companies or provide the data to companies advertising in the app.\",\n    \"Choice found with the Glow Fertility, Nurture and Eve apps that the apps “collect further information” about users from other companies, which are only described as third-party sources.\",\n    \"The Ovia Fertility and Pregnancy apps were found to collect extensive data not required for the app, including diseases, financial situation, housing, safety and education level.

But it didn't say that it would also send it to third parties.\nSince its release in February 2011, the app has been downloaded between 50m and 100m times, according to data on the Google Play app store.\n\"When consumers are given a real, informed choice, they can decide for themselves whether the benefit of a service is worth the information they must share to use it,' said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's consumer protection bureau. \"But this flashlight left them in the dark about how their information was going to be used.\"\nFalse choice\nThe FTC also said that the app gave users a false choice: \"At the bottom of the license agreement, consumers could click to 'Accept' or 'Refuse' the terms of the agreement. Even before a consumer had a chance to accept those terms, though, the application was already collecting and sending information to third parties – including location and the unique device identifier.\"\nThat meant that advertisers could in effect have tracked users through their device ID and location to see what adverts they were clicking on - and even identified people through related information.\nAnalysts warned that the revelation could harm Google's reputation - and that other apps on the Android market are suspected of doing the same. \n\"Bad security\/privacy hurts Google's attempts to build trust and willingness to pay [for apps],\" commented the research company Canalys.\nFake warning\nIn October, three security researchers from Bitdefender examined 630,000 apps in the Google Play store and said that more than 23,000 of them grabbed the user's email address. They also highlighted Brightest Flashlight Free for displaying a fake antivirus warning which suggested that the user's phone harboured malware.\nGraham Cluley, an independent security expert, commented: \"The question remains, of course, how many *other* free Android apps are doing similarly sneaky tricks, exposing the privacy of their users?\"\nUnder the settlement, the app will in future have to tell users how, where and when their data is about to be shared, and get their express permission to do so.\nThe case is the first where the FTC has zeroed in on unwanted sharing of geolocation data as part of its requirement to protect US consumer privacy.\nAndroid apps tell users what information they will collect from users before they are installed - but do not give any explanation of what or how the information will be used, or why it is necessary to collect it. There is also no standard way to veto the collection of data or access to a machine function by an app.\nThe Play Store app, which has generally received good reviews - an average of 4.8 out of 5 - turns on all the lights on the device to create a torch. It also says that it offers \"unobtrusive ads\".\nThe developer, GoldenShores Technologies, also offers another app for choosing colours, which is also ad-supported. It has had far fewer downloads, totalling around 50,000. The FTC didn't say whether it is investigating that app.\nErik Geidl, who runs GoldenShores Technologies, has been ordered to delete any personal information that the app has collected. He is also required to tell the FTC if he changes his employment over the next ten years.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": [\n        \"An innocuous-looking torch app for Android with over 50 million downloads.\",\n        \"The app silently shared users' locations and device IDs with advertisers.\",\n        \"The maker of Brightest Flashlight Free admitted to deceptive privacy policy.\",\n        \"Privacy policy failed to disclose the sharing of location and device ID data with advertisers.\",\n        \"The app had been downloaded between 50 million and 100 million times since its release.\",\n        \"The FTC found that users were not given a real, informed choice about their data sharing.\",\n        \"The app gave users a false choice regarding accepting or refusing terms before data collection.\",\n        \"Advertisers could potentially track users through device ID and location data.\",\n        \"This incident could harm Google's reputation and raise concerns about other Android apps.\",\n        \"Other security concerns were raised, such as displaying a fake antivirus warning.\",\n        \"Under the settlement, the app will have to inform users about data sharing and obtain their express permission.\",\n        \"This case focuses on unwanted sharing of geolocation data, a privacy violation.\",\n        \"Android apps typically inform users about data collection but lack transparency about usage and necessity.\",\n        \"The app received good reviews with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5.\",\n        \"The developer, GoldenShores Technologies, is ordered to delete collected personal information.\"\n    ]\n}\nThe news is relevant to privacy issues as it discusses how the Brightest Flashlight Free Android app secretly shared users' location and device data with advertisers, which is a form of location information leakage and a violation of privacy.

Some mobile advertising analysts believe that fewer than one in three users are likely to grant permission.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nIPhone owners also have a \"tracking\" menu in their phone's privacy settings where they can opt-out of tracking from all apps on their phone with a single switch, or pick and choose among apps to grant permission to.\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DEVELOPERS AND ADVERTISERS?\nBoth advertisers and app developers who sell ad inventory say if many iPhone users opt-out of tracking, it will make advertising less effective. The ad industry has long gathered data about people's web browsing behavior in order to serve up ads, such as for clothes or cars, that users might be interested in.\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\nA shrinking pool of user data could lead to lower sales for brands and lower ad revenue for mobile apps and publishers. Apple's move has deepened a rift with Facebook Inc (FB.O), which has said the change will hurt small businesses because it will impede their ability to cost-effectively find local customers to target with advertisements.\nWHY DID APPLE MAKE THE CHANGE?\nApple has said it wanted to give its customers more control over whether data collected on them by apps is shared with third parties.\nCAN APPS STILL COLLECT DATA ON IPHONE USERS?\nYes, data collection is still allowed if it is spelled out in an app's privacy policy. The changes only affect whether app developers share data they collect with third parties, or mix their data with outside data from third parties, to help target ads. Apple has introduced privacy \"nutrition labels\" to its App Store to show users what data apps collect.\nWILL IPHONE APPS STILL HAVE ADS?\nYes, iPhone users can still see ads even if they decline the new pop-up, as long as those ads are targeted using data the app developer has collected on its own. For example, a social network like Facebook Inc (FB.O) can still target ads based on first-party data such as which groups users join or which posts they like. But if Facebook wants to target ads based on data from which third-party websites users have used their Facebook credentials to log into, it will need to seek permission.\nReporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco.

A spokeswoman said there was \"nothing sinister\" going on, and added that it would not be profiteering from customers.

It is writing to current and savings account customers to let them know about the changes, which will take effect on 9 October.\nA leaflet details the \"new ways\" in which Barclays' companies can use customer data, stating: \"We can combine information about you with information about other Barclays customers to create reports which we may share with companies outside Barclays.

It would confirm \"at a country level\" if the customer was in the region where the suspicious transaction had taken place. Customers will be able to opt out of this if they wish.\nBarclays is the latest in a line of companies to come under scrutiny over the way they use customer information.

Tesco also plans to use its Clubcard data to tackle obesity by offering customers \"tailored suggestions for how they could shop more healthily\".\nFinancial companies have different policies when it comes to the use of people's data.

But they said “as our results show, there appears to not be any (or only limited) enforcement”.\nWhile the researchers surmised that it is likely that “many privacy violations are unintentional and caused by misunderstandings of third-party Software Development Kitss” that are used to build the apps, they urged Google to do more active vetting process of apps for Coppa compliance.\nThe researchers also analysed whether apps with potential Coppa violations were part of the US Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Safe Harbor programme, under which developers submit their apps for certification that they are Coppa-compliant. They found that few apps are actually certified under Safe Harbor and of those that are “potential violations are prevalent”.\n“Based on our data, it is not clear that industry self-regulation has resulted in higher privacy standards; some of our data suggest the opposite. Thus, industry self-regulation appears to be ineﬀective,” the researchers wrote.\nGolin said: “It’s also clear that self-regulation efforts – both Google’s attempts to ensure Coppa compliance at the app store level and the Safe Harbor certification programme – are failing families. As has been demonstrated time and time again, self-regulation is no substitute for sustained government enforcement.”\nJeffrey Chester, executive director for the Center for Digital Democracy, said: “For years, the FTC has failed to address how both Google and Facebook routinely undermine consumer privacy.”\n“However, the FTC has just been through [an] earthquake-like wake up call, given the revelations that Facebook allowed companies like Cambridge Analytica to seize data on 87 million people … Parents are confronted with a nearly impossible task. Given the dominance of the Google App platform and the interest young children have in apps, it’s not practical for a parent to have to spend time trying to decipher the complex connections that drive the ad supported App industry.\n“That’s why we hope the FTC has finally awoken from its long digital privacy slumber.”\nA Google spokesperson said: “We’re taking the researchers’ report very seriously and looking into their findings. Protecting kids and families is a top priority, and our Designed for Families programme requires developers to abide by specific requirements above and beyond our standard Google Play policies.\n“If we determine that an app violates our policies, we will take action.

The federation of German consumer organisations (VZBV), which brought the suit, argued that Facebook opted users in to features which it should not have.\nHeiko Duenkel, litigation policy officer at the VZBV, said: “Facebook hides default settings that are not privacy friendly in its privacy centre and does not provide sufficient information about it when users register. This does not meet the requirement for informed consent.”\nIn a statement, VZBV elaborated on some of its issues: “In the Facebook app for smartphones, for example, a location service was pre-activated that reveals a user’s location to people they are chatting to.\n“In the privacy settings, ticks were already placed in boxes that allowed search engines to link to the user’s timeline. This meant that anyone could quickly and easily find personal Facebook profiles.”\nThe Berlin court agreed with VZBV that the five default settings the group had complained about were invalid as declarations of consent. The German language judgment was handed down in mid-January, but only publicly revealed on Monday.\nThe court also ruled eight clauses in Facebook’s terms of service to be invalid, including terms that allow Facebook to transmit data to the US and use personal data for commercial purposes. The company’s “authentic name” policy – a revision of a rule that once required users to use their “real names” on the site, but which now allows them to use any names they are widely known by – was also ruled unlawful.\nIn a statement, Facebook said it would appeal, adding: “We are working hard to ensure that our guidelines are clear and easy to understand, and that the services offered by Facebook are in full accordance with the law.”\nA week after the Berlin court ruled against Facebook, the social network promised to radically overhaul its privacy settings, saying the work would prepare it for the introduction in Europe of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a sweeping set of laws governing data use across the EU.\nSheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, announced the changes, saying they would “put the core privacy settings for Facebook in one place and make it much easier for people to manage their data”.\nQ&A\nWhat is GDPR?\nShow\nFacebook has faced repeated attacks from European regulators, particularly those in Germany, over issues ranging from perceived anti-competitive practices to alleged misuse of customer data.\nSince March 2016, the company has been investigated by the German Federal Cartel Office over allegations it breaches data protection law in order to support an unfair monopoly. In an interim update in December last year, the office said that it objected to the way Facebook gains access to third-party data when an account is opened. This includes transferring information from its own WhatsApp and Instagram products – as well as how it tracks which sites its users access.\nIn October, Facebook was the target of an EU-wide investigation over a similar issue. The Article 29 Working Party (WP29), which oversees data regulation issues across the European Union, launched a taskforce to examine the sharing of user data between WhatsApp and Facebook, which it says does not have sufficient user consent. When the data sharing feature was first announced in 2016, the group warned Facebook that it may not be legal under European law, prompting the company to pause the data transfer until a resolution was found.\n“Whilst the WP29 notes there is a balance to be struck between presenting the user with too much information and not enough, the initial screen made no mention at all of the key information users needed to make an informed choice, namely that clicking the agree button would result in their personal data being shared with the Facebook family of companies,” the group told WhatsApp in October.\nFacebook should be ‘regulated like cigarette industry’, says tech CEO","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": {\n        \"Reason\": \"Privacy Violation\",\n        \"Details\": [\n            \"The Berlin regional court ruled that Facebook's default privacy settings and use of personal data are against German consumer law.\",\n            \"The court found that Facebook collects and uses personal data without providing enough information to its members for meaningful consent.\",\n            \"Facebook's default settings were not privacy-friendly, and users were not adequately informed during the registration process.\",\n            \"One specific issue mentioned was the pre-activation of a location service in the Facebook app, revealing users' locations to others.\",\n            \"Privacy settings allowed search engines to link to users' timelines without their explicit consent.\",\n            \"The court invalidated five default settings and eight clauses in Facebook's terms of service, including data transmission to the US and commercial use of personal data.\",\n            \"Facebook's 'authentic name' policy was also ruled unlawful.\",\n            \"Facebook announced plans to appeal the court's decision and stated its commitment to ensuring clear and lawful guidelines for its services.\",\n            \"This news highlights concerns about privacy violations and data misuse by Facebook.\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\nIn summary, this news is relevant because it discusses a German court ruling that found Facebook's default privacy settings and use of personal data to be in violation of consumer privacy laws.

{"num":27,"Time":"MARCH 22, 2018","Title":"Facebook scandal could push other tech companies to tighten data sharing","Content":"By Paresh Dave\n6 MIN READ\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Big internet companies and small software developers alike are likely to face scrutiny over how they share customer information in the wake of the scandal involving Facebook Inc FB.O and the British election consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.\nA figurine is seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\nLawmakers in the United States and the EU have called for probes into how Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica to access data on 50 million users and use it to help the election campaign of President Donald Trump. Facebook shares have fallen 8.5 percent this week as investors fear the incident will lead to new regulation.\nThe scrutiny and the risk of regulatory action could affect Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, Twitter Inc TWTR.N, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O LinkedIn and the many others that make their user data available to outside developers.\nThe interconnections between platforms such as Facebook and Google and third-party services sit at the core of the contemporary internet, enabling people to quickly share articles to Facebook from news websites and log into shopping apps using their Google account.\nBut the Facebook case has turned the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that enable such data sharing, into a new front in the escalating battle between lawmakers and tech companies over the monitoring and securing of their vast platforms. Threat of sanctions has already prodded companies into better policing of inappropriate commentary on their services.\n“All companies are going to need to do a lot more than just laissez faire policy to manage third-party data access moving forward,” said Jason Costa, who helped run APIs at Pinterest Inc, Twitter and Google and now works at GGV Capital. “The days of (the) ‘we’re just a platform and can’t be held responsible for how users use it’ line that many companies use, is no longer going to be tenable.”\nAPIs have raised privacy concerns since they emerged around 2005, but their adoption and impact has grown rapidly as companies move data online and look for ways to make it more useful.\nUber, for example, in 2016 enabled apps that provided tax and lending services to import driver paystubs. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its monitoring and auditing practices.\nThe economic dynamic behind APIs is simple: software developers create new tools that benefit big tech companies’ users, and in return they gain instant access to a large number of consumers.\nThe big platforms say they have built in protection, such as human reviews and automated scanning tools to detect abuse by partners.\nBut software experts say policies are toothless because auditing is lax; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, under intense public pressure, said Wednesday the company would now perform audits of the information it shared with partners before it tightened rules in 2014.\nDartmouth University engineering professor Geoffrey Parker, who has assigned students to develop apps based on APIs, said automated policing methods will detect spam-like apps and brazen efforts to steal data. It is much more difficult to enforce bans on storing or mashing together information, or acting against users’ interest, he said.\nSome companies added safeguards in the last several years. Facebook stopped allowing developers access to information on its users’ friends. But compliance audits were minimal, a former employee said on the condition of anonymity.\nTwitter and LinkedIn limited free public access.\nFor paid deals, LinkedIn said “partners are rigorously vetted and regularly declined.” The company added that it regularly monitors API usage and takes “swift action when we see or hear of any abuse of our terms.”\nSoftware developers acknowledged they often do not even read the terms of use for APIs. Rule-breakers can fly under the radar and amass significant information, said Andres Blank, chief executive of recruiting software maker Scout.\n“It’s hard to police if the alarms aren’t being sounded,” said Blank, who has worked with APIs from LinkedIn and Google.\nAlex Moore, chief executive of Baydin Inc, which develops Boomerang, an app that can send emails on time-delay, said Microsoft scrutinized his services when the companies partnered on a new feature. But he was not aware of any auditing after it launched.\nGoogle recently asked whether Boomerang could access less information, but that was a rare “poke,” Moore said.\n“There’s going to be things people took for granted about data sharing that come to light,” he said.\nGoogle declined to comment. Microsoft did not respond to a request to comment.\nClamping down could limit the supply of innovative tools built on data sharing. But some providers, including Royal Bank of Canada, which announced an API this week, have gone a step further to only allow access to vetted partners.\nPaul Nerger, senior vice president at Developerprogram.com, which helps companies such as Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O manage APIs, said clients have limited the number of partners so that software can be tested \"to make sure they are not illegally harvesting\" data.\nStartups are taking heed too. Affectiva, which last year released an API for identifying consumers’ emotional states from speech samples, said that it would audit partners as its program grows.\nGabi Zijderveld, the company’s chief marketing officer and head of product strategy, said, though, “we inevitably need regulation and legislation on ethical and transparent use of data.”\nReporting by Paresh Dave; Additional reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Neil Fullick\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news article in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": [\n        \"The news discusses the scandal involving Facebook Inc and Cambridge Analytica, which is related to data sharing and privacy concerns.\",\n        \"Lawmakers in the United States and the EU are calling for probes into how Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica to access data on 50 million users for election campaign purposes.\",\n        \"The article mentions the impact on various tech companies, including Alphabet Inc's Google, Twitter Inc, Uber Technologies Inc, Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn, and others, who make user data available to outside developers.\",\n        \"It highlights the role of application programming interfaces (APIs) in data sharing and the growing concerns about their impact on privacy.\",\n        \"The news discusses the need for companies to do more to manage third-party data access and mentions that the previous stance of 'we're just a platform and can't be held responsible for how users use it' is no longer tenable.\",\n        \"It points out that APIs have raised privacy concerns since their emergence and the challenges in enforcing bans on storing or mashing together information.\",\n        \"The article highlights that while some companies have added safeguards in recent years, auditing and enforcement of policies remain a concern.\",\n        \"It also mentions that startups and organizations are considering audits and regulation on the ethical and transparent use of data.\",\n        \"Overall, the news article is relevant as it discusses issues related to privacy and data sharing, especially in the context of the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal.\"\n    ]\n}\nThe news is relevant because it discusses problems related to privacy and data sharing, which aligns with your criteria.

It’s a sprawling, unregulated ecosystem”, and looking into what they do and how they do it can get “very creepy, very fast”.\n“They know significantly more about you than you might think, and do significantly more with it than you might like,” Oliver said.\nThe main tools are cookies, which enable websites to remember you and have evolved to include third-party cookies, which track where else you are going on the internet. “I don’t know about you but I don’t want a whole crowd of strangers watching what I search for on the internet,” he said. “Not because it’s gross, but because it’s private.”\nThe process takes breadcrumbs of where we have gone and what we have done online, and packages it to share with marketing firms. Users are then sorted into groups, such as couples with clout, ambitious singles, boomers and boomerangs and kids and cabernet.\nThe dark side of this includes more narrowly targeted lists, which separate us by certain ailments or sexual preferences. Investigations have found that people are defined by their depression, diabetes, cancer and pregnancy. It’s a “system that seems ripe for abuse” as “what they can buy is pretty troubling”.\nWhile marketing firms have claimed the data is anonymous, the process of “de-anonymising” is fairly easy as Oliver details as people can be discovered by a quick data investigation. “None of us are really anonymous online,” he said.\nHe called it all “objectively unsettling” and used an example of a priest who was forced to resign after a Catholic newsletter used app data signals from Grindr and matched his phone to his residence, outing him.\nIt’s a “massive, harmful invasion of privacy” and also incredibly dangerous. He used the example of a domestic violence victim whose address came up on a data broker website. Oliver also shared a horrifying story of a stalker who killed a former classmate after finding her with info he brought for $45.\nRequesting removal of information is a “complex process” and there is no federal law requiring that the companies honour an opt-out request.\nIt also suits the government as both FBI and Ice have bought data to aid criminal investigations and deportations.\n“The entire economy of the internet is basically built on this practice,” he said. “All the free stuff that you take for granted online is only free because you are the product.”\nHe said there needs to be a comprehensive federal privacy law but many politicians build their campaigns on use of personal data.\nHe used the example of the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988, which was passed when Congress freaked out when they realised their video rental histories could be shared. “It seems when Congress’s own privacy is at risk they somehow find a way to act,” he said.\nTo show this, Oliver’s team used “perfectly legal bits of fuckery” to target members of Congress. They bought ads and showed them to men over 45 in DC who had searched for divorce, massage, hair loss and mid-life crisis, creating a group called Congress and cabernet.\n“This whole exercise was fucking creepy,” he said with ads that pushed divorce help, Ted Cruz erotic fiction and voting twice. He said it might worry members of Congress that he now has the information of who clicked on what. “You might want to channel that worry into making sure that I can’t do anything with it,” he said.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage.

A predator could have tracked your child’s cell phone to know when they were alone.”\nHe later praised the FCC decision to investigate, as first reported by Reuters.\n“I urge the FCC expand the scope of this investigation, and to more broadly probe the practice of third parties buying real-time location data on Americans,” Wyden said.\nRobert Xiao, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, said a flaw in a demo tool from LocationSmart could have been used to track anyone.\nLocationSmart spokeswoman Brenda Schafer said on Friday the vulnerability “has been resolved and the demo has been disabled.”\nPrior to Xiao’s efforts, which included locating up to two dozen users, Schafer said the company believes no one else exploited the vulnerability.\nThe company is committed to “continuous improvement of its information privacy and security measures,” she said.\nLast week, the New York Times reported that the former sheriff of Mississippi County, Missouri, used Securus Technologies [CASHAL.UL] to track mobile phones - including those of other police officers - without court orders, citing charges filed against him.\nSeveral published reports said Securus is getting its data through an intermediary of LocationSmart.\nVerizon spokesman Rich Young said Friday the company has “taken steps to ensure that Securus can no longer access location information about Verizon Wireless customers.” He added the company has “initiated a review of this entire issue.”\nAT&T spokesman Mike Balmoris said the company does not “permit sharing of location information without customer consent or a demand from law enforcement.

{"num":60,"Time":"SEPTEMBER 28, 2014","Title":"Phoning 'home': what your mobile may be giving away","Content":"By Jeremy Wagstaff\n8 MIN READ\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - When popular Chinese handset maker Xiaomi Inc admitted that its devices were sending users’ personal information back to a server in China, it prompted howls of protest and an investigation by Taiwan’s government.\nThree models of China's Xiaomi Mi phones are pictured during their launch in New Delhi July 15, 2014. REUTERS\/Anindito Mukherjee\/Files\nThe affair has also drawn attention to just how little we know about what happens between our smartphone and the outside world. In short: it might be in your pocket, but you don’t call the shots.\nAs long as a device is switched on, it could be communicating with at least three different masters: the company that built it, the telephone company it connects to, and the developers of any third party applications you installed on the device - or were pre-installed before you bought it.\nAll these companies could have programmed the device to send data ‘back home’ to them over a wireless or cellular network - with or without the user’s knowledge or consent. In Xiaomi’s case, as soon as a user booted up their device it started sending personal data ‘back home’.\nThis, Xiaomi said, was to allow users to send SMS messages without having to pay operator charges by routing the messages through Xiaomi’s servers. To do that, the company said, it needed to know the contents of users’ address books.\n“What Xiaomi did originally was clearly wrong: they were collecting your address book and sending it to themselves without you ever agreeing to it,” said Mikko Hypponen, whose computer security company F-Secure helped uncover the problem. “What’s more, it was sent unencrypted.”\nXiaomi has said it since fixed the problem by seeking users’ permission first, and only sending data over encrypted connections, he noted.\nINDUSTRY ISSUE\nXiaomi is by no means alone in grabbing data from your phone as soon as you switch it on.\nA cellular operator may collect data from you, ostensibly to improve how you set up your phone for the first time, says Bryce Boland, Asia Pacific chief technology officer at FireEye, an internet security firm. Handset makers, he said, may also be collecting information, from your location to how long it takes you to set up the phone.\n“It’s not that it’s specific to any handset maker or telco,” said Boland. “It’s more of an industry problem, where organisations are taking steps to collect data they can use for a variety of purposes, which may be legitimate but potentially also have some privacy concerns.”\nMany carriers, for example, include in their terms of service the right to collect personal data about the device, computer and online activities - including what web sites users visit. One case study by Hewlett-Packard and Qosmos, a French internet security company, was able to track individual devices to, for example, identify how many Facebook messages a user sent. The goal: using all this data to pitch users highly personalized advertising.\nBut some users fear it’s not just the carriers collecting such detailed data.\nThree years ago, users were alarmed to hear that U.S. carriers pre-installed an app from a company called Carrier IQ that appeared to transmit personal data to the carrier.\nUsers filed a class-action lawsuit, not against the carriers but against handset makers including HTC Corp, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics which, they say, used the software to go beyond collecting diagnostic data the carriers needed.\nThe suit alleges the handset firms used the Carrier IQ software to intercept private information for themselves, including recording users’ email and text messages without their permission - data the users claim may also have been shared with third parties. The companies are contesting the case.\nAnd then there are the apps that users install. Each requires your permission to be able to access data or functions on your device - the microphone, say, if you want that device to record audio, or locational data if you want it to provide suggestions about nearby restaurants.\nSHEDDING SOME LIGHT\nBut it isn’t always easy for a user to figure out just what information or functions are being accessed, what data is then being sent back to the developers’ servers - and what happens to that data once it gets there. Bitdefender, a Romania-based antivirus manufacturer, found last year that one in three of Android smartphone apps upload personal information to “third party companies, without specifically letting you know.”\nNot only is this hidden from the user, it’s often unrelated to the app’s purpose.\nTake for example, an Android app that turns your device into a torch by turning on all its lights - from the camera flash to the keyboard backlight. When users complained about it also sending location-based data, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission forced the app’s Idaho-based developer to make clear the free app was also collecting data so it could target users with location-specific ads. Even so, the app has been installed more than 50 million times and has overwhelmingly positive user reviews.\nWhile most concerns are about phones running Android, Apple Inc’s devices aren’t free from privacy concerns.\nCarriers control the code on the SIM, for example, and this is one possible way to access data on the phone. And, despite stricter controls over apps in Apple’s app store, FireEye’s Boland says his company continues to find malicious apps for the iOS platform, and apps that send sensitive data without the user knowing. “The iPhone platform is more secure than the Android platform, but it’s certainly not perfect,” he said.\nApple says its iOS protects users’ data by ensuring apps are digitally signed and verified by Apple’s own security system.\nBACK IN THE DRIVING SEAT\nThe problem, then, often isn’t about whether handset makers, app developers and phone companies are grabbing data from your phone, but what kind of data, when, and for what.\n“If we look at the content sent by many apps it’s mindboggling how much is actually sent,” said Boland. “It’s impossible for someone to really know whether something is good or bad unless they know the context.”\nHandset makers need to be clear with users about what they’re doing and why, said Carl Pei, director at OnePlus, a Shenzhen, China-based upstart rival to Xiaomi. OnePlus collects “anonymous statistical information” such as where a phone is activated, the model and the version of software that runs on it, Pei said, which helps them make better decisions about servicing customers and where to focus production.\nUnlike Xiaomi, Pei said, OnePlus’ servers are based in the United States, which in the light of recent privacy concerns, he said, “gives people greater peace of mind than having them based out of China.”\nThat peace of mind may be elusive as long as there’s money to be made, says David Rogers, who teaches mobile systems security at the University of Oxford and chairs the Device Security Group at the GSMA, a global mobile industry trade association.\n“Users are often sacrificed to very poor security design and a lack of consideration for privacy,” he said. “At the same time, taking user data is part of a profit model for many corporations so they don’t make it easy for users to prevent what is essentially data theft.”\nEditing by Ian Geoghegan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage.

Numerous vulnerabilities in people’s health data privacy have been highlighted and exacerbated as a result, putting individuals in harm’s way by data brokers and predatory data tracking companies. The My Health, My Data Act will address the collection, sharing, and selling of sensitive health-related data,” Democratic Rep. Vandana Slatte, who introduced the House bill, told CNN in a statement.\nNew York City starts offering free abortion pills at sexual health clinics\nThe proposed law, which was brought forth in both Democratic-controlled chambers, would prohibit the selling of consumer health data and require “additional disclosures and consumer consent regarding the collection, sharing, and use of such information.”\nIt would also allow users to delete their data and would prohibit the use of “geofence” technology around facilities that provide health care services if it uses information such as cell tower data and wifi to collect data about consumers’ identities and movements.\nThe proposal also covers health data related to such issues as gender-affirming care and genetics.\nThe law would cover Washington residents or those whose consumer health data is collected in the state and would be enforced under the state’s consumer protection law. It would apply to businesses that provide “products or services that are targeted to consumers in Washington.”\nPregnancy Justice, a nonprofit that provides legal representation for people charged with crimes related to pregnancy, said they have not tracked any specific instances of data from period-tracking apps being used against women.\nBut, the organization told CNN, “that’s not to say that the apps aren’t a reason for concern.”\nOne example that is often cited by abortion-rights proponents in the post-Roe legal landscape is a case that began even before Roe was overturned. A Nebraska mother and her 18-year-old daughter were charged last year after police obtained Facebook messages between the two. Authorities allege the messages show evidence of an illegal self-managed medication abortion, as well as a plan to hide the remains. They both pleaded not guilty.\n“With the significant growth in the use of tracking apps, online chats, social media and search engines for accessing health care information, advice and research, these protections for sensitive health data are long overdue,” said Sen. Manka Dhingra, one of the sponsors of the state Senate’s companion bill, SB 5351. “And with the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn 50 years of precedent and put reproductive freedom in danger, it’s all the more urgent that we take action.”\nSimilar legislation was signed into law last year in California by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. It bars companies based in the state from giving up geolocation data, search histories and other personal information in response to out-of-state search warrants, unless those warrants are accompanied by a statement that the evidence sought isn’t connected to an abortion investigation.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant because it discusses the My Health, My Data Act, a bill introduced in Washington's state legislature, which aims to protect the privacy of health data collected by apps, including period-tracking apps.

{"num":71,"Time":"Mon 23 Apr 2012 18.08 CEST","Title":"DoubleClick (Google): What is it and what does it do?","Content":"What is Doubleclick?\nDoubleclick is a business owned by Google that makes it money from online advertisers and publishers. This is done by:\nAd-serving\nOnline publishers use Doubleclick to display adverts on their websites.\nAd delivery\nDoubleclick will let advertisers control how often an ad is shown to a browser, how long it is shown for and how often it will appear.\nBehavioural targeting\nThis comes in two categories:\nTargeting for one website owner: An online publisher can set a Doubleclick cookie to tell them what sections of their sites you are browsing. Doubleclick will then judge the type of adverts you might like to see from what you're browsing. For example, if you are on a news website and you visit the sports pages, then adverts for match tickets may be more relevant than makeup. This information belongs to the website owner only.\nTargeting in advertising networks: Google runs a service called Adsense, in which lots of different publishers pool the information they get on browsers. This helps them build up a better idea of the type of adverts someone might want to see. This is a third-party advertising cookie.\nWho uses Doubleclick?\nAny web publishers can use Doubleclick, as long as they meet the company's terms and conditions. Google also uses Doubleclick across its own sites.\nWhat information is Doubleclick tracking?\nIn their privacy policy, Google explains how data is recorded from a generic Doubleclick cookie. It looks like this:\ntime: 06\/Aug\/2008 12:01:32\nad_placement_id: 105\nad_id: 1003\nuserid: 0000000000000001\nclient_ip: 123.45.67.89\nreferral_url: \"http:\/\/youtube.com\/categories\"\nThis tells Doubleclick the time and date you saw an advert. It also shows:\nuserid: the unique ID number the cookie has given your browser\nad_id: the unique ID of the advert\nad_placement_id: the ID of where the advert was seen on the site\nreferral_url: what page you were on when you saw the advert\nBecause it records your IP address, Doubleclick can also make a good guess of your country and town\/city, too.\nHow is this information used?\nOn its own, this data can tell Doubleclick how many times you have seen an ad and, for example, whether you need to see the UK or US version. It cannot find out any personal information about you.\nIf the cookie is set on an website that is part of AdSense and then you browse another site using AdSense, the the same information will be recorded and pooled. Over time, guesses can be made about the interests of the person using that browser – whether they like football or ballet, for example, or if they visit Marks & Spencers more than Tesco..\nIf enough browsers display similar patterns, they become part of a \"segment\" labelled something like \"football lovers\", \"fine food lovers\", \"current affairs enthusiasts\", etc – these become labels that Doubleclick lets advertisers choose from when they select the types of people they want to see their ads.\nOnce Doubleclick have an idea about the interests of the person using the browser, they will try to use them to infer how old you are and whether you are male or female (again, to put you in a segment).\nTo check what segments Doubleclick has you in, go to Google's ad preferences manager (you don't have to be signed in to Google).\nEven if Doubleclick is used to serve adverts, Google says there are some websites where segments won't be created: for example, health websites (where there is a risk of building up a profile of a medical condition) and political websites (where they might build up a picture of a political affiliation).\nHow much money does Doubleclick make?\nGoogle bought DoubleClick for $3.1bn in 2008; since then its financials are combined with other parts of Google.\nGoogle currently generates 96% of its revenue through its advertising products.\nIn 2011, it saw advertising revenues of $36.5bn, with $10.4bn coming from non-Google sites in its ad network.\nIs the data sold to third parties?\nGoogle says it is not sold to third parties. When the service is being used by a publisher for its own purposes (not in an ad network), the publisher owns that data, not Doubleclick.\nIf data has not been sold on, has it been given to or shared free of charge with third parties?\nNot directly. However, the Doubleclick platform is a charged-for product and the use of segments is part of the appeal for advertisers. While they are never given information about individual browsers, they do benefit from all the data in an aggregated form.\nHow long is the data stored for on the user's browser and on Doubleclick's servers?\nDoubleclick cookies on the browser are set to expire after a number of years (we have seen dates in 2014 for these). However, the override for this is clearing cookies.\nNewer cookies \"60 days in market\" and \"30 days in market\" are actually more valuable to advertisers as they give a better indication of what the person using that browser is interested in right now.\nIP addresses are anonymised after nine months and the data in cookies is anonymised after 18 months. At this point they are not used.\nWhat evidence is there that Doubleclick deletes the data?\nA tricky question to answer, but when it comes to the cookie on your browser, Google says if you opt out from receiving Doubleclick cookies and visit its ad preferences manager, it will recognise your opt-out status.\nIs the data ever matched to personally identifiable information?\nNever, says Google. This would be a breach of Doubleclick's terms and conditions. The information obtained from the cookies is also never combined with information that Google obtains from its other products and services. You browsing behaviour will never be linked to your Gmail account, for example.\nWhat other ways does it track?\nIn addition to its Doubleclick cookies, Google says that if you click on an advert a cookie will be set on your browser. This is designed so that the company that advertised will know if you then, after seeing an advert, went on to buy the product.\nWhen a cookie isn't available, Google say it may use \"anonymous identifiers\" instead. This may happen if you access a site from a mobile, for example. One such \"anonymous identifier\" would be Doubleclick recognising the unique ID of your phone or tablet and assigning you an ID. Googe's privacy policy gives instructions on how to manage this process.\nDo the cookies circumvent privacy-enhancing software?\nNo special effort is put into circumnavigating tools that are designed to block cookies from working, says Google.\nCan Google give one example of how tracking genuinely benefits the people being tracked?\nThe case from Google\nShort-term benefits:\nRelevancy (Before cookies the web was much worse at distributing adverts that had absolutely no relevance or interest to the people browsing. It still isn't an exact science but they say it's hard to argue with the evidence that ads that use targeting are more likely to be clicked on.)\nFrequency capping (Cookies can control how often a browser sees the same advert, so browsers don't get pushed the same advert continuously.)\nControl (Unlike other forms of tracking, such as digital fingerprinting, cookies provide ways for savvy web users to control and block particular advertisers.)\nLong-term benefit: it helps pay for the content you read on the web.\nFurther reading:\nGoogle's Privacy statement (which includes Doubleclick)\nEvidon factsheet on Doubleclick\nDetails on how to opt out of the Doubleclick cookie\nGoogle Advertising Opt-out browser plugin","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems related to privacy leakage, specifically about online tracking and data collection.

We monitored our sleep, workouts, periods and fertility windows. But there is plenty left to measure as we are sold the promise of self-optimisation by the vast and sometimes controversial frontier of health tracking – an increasingly medicalised market that has flourished since pedometers went digital and watches got smart.\nThe latest health metric available to consumers comes from a medical device originally designed for people with diabetes; it allows users to track their blood sugar levels. But, as always, the big questions are: will it make us healthier, and is it wise to sacrifice ever more intimate data?\nThere is no doubt the device itself is revolutionary. In 2017, the NHS began to prescribe the FreeStyle Libre to monitor blood-glucose levels for people with diabetes. Rather than prick a finger and squeeze a drop of blood on to a testing strip, a patient could stick a coin-sized sensor with a tiny probe to their upper arm. The painless probe barely pierces the arm, measuring glucose constantly via liquids just under the skin and giving a readout with the swipe of an electronic reader.\nThe system promised way more data and control for people with diabetes, who try to avoid dangerous peaks and troughs in blood-sugar levels. Soon they could pair their phones with the sensor, keeping a record in an app without ever having to draw blood. It was a life-changing marriage of medical and consumer technologies.\nLaura Douglas isn’t diabetic, but a few years ago she began experimenting with one of the sensors, which is made by the US health corporation Abbott Laboratories. In the simplest terms, spikes in sugar levels can induce hunger. You eat a biscuit and your levels go up, then crash: you want another biscuit.\n“I found it almost rewired my brain,” says Douglas, a 29-year-old engineer and health researcher based in London. “If I saw a spike, I’d know what had caused it and avoid that food because I had the memory of the spike, rather than weighing myself every day and thinking: ‘It’s going OK overall.’”\nSugar rush … diabetics now test their glucose levels with sensors.

The startup, which is in the testing phase, pairs FreeStyle Libre sensors with its own app to understand the effects of foods on an individual’s glucose response, using artificial intelligence to recommend a personalised diet. “A lot of diets will tell you not to eat when your sugar levels crash,” says Douglas, who is from Edinburgh and has a master’s degree in machine learning. “We say: ‘Don’t spike too much in the first place.’”\nMyLevels has sent sensors to about 300 trial customers; it plans to launch fully in a few months (a 14-day programme costs £139). Customers are invited to eat test foods, such as a bar of Dairy Milk, to get a range of individual baseline responses, and log what they eat. Foods are then scored as part of a new recommended diet that aims to avoid sugar spikes.\nDouglas is not alone. “The use of continuous glucose monitors in healthy individuals is an exploding area,” says Sarah Berry, a senior lecturer in nutritional sciences at King’s College London and an expert in postprandial metabolism, or the way we respond to food.\nBerry is an adviser to Zoe, a health science company founded in 2018 that monitors glucose levels as well as body fat and gut health. Meanwhile, Supersapiens – an app from the US – uses glucose monitors to optimise diets and training for top athletes. There were rumours that Apple was going to add glucose monitoring to its latest smartwatch, which goes on sale later this autumn. It didn’t, but new devices that use technology called spectrometry are in the pipeline. These can “scan” for blood glucose levels in your wrist without a probe.\nScientists are pushing the limits of technology and consumer demand, cramming shrinking circuitry into wearables, including smart patches that will work as one-stop diagnostic and tracking centres. “We’ve probably reached the point where we’re mostly satisfied with the size and functionality of our phones,” says Sara Ghoreishizadeh, an electronics engineer at University College London, where she is developing a smart mouth guard. The device will track acid levels and hormones in saliva to determine metrics including dental health and sleep quality. “Now it’s time to develop stronger technology to allow us to track our health.”\nI watched the announcement of the new Apple Watch last month with interest. A few weeks earlier, my Garmin smartwatch gave up the ghost. Before that, I wore a Fitbit to count steps, track my pulse and sleep, and record runs and bike rides. My instinct was to get a replacement. I decided to wait to see how much the new Apple device would cost. Still keen at least to track the time while I waited, I dug an old Casio out of a desk drawer.\nFor several weeks, I have worn nothing more on my wrist than the time. And, spoiler alert, it has been fine; a relief, even. I no longer feel the need to track every mile I ride or step I take. My activity levels haven’t changed – and I don’t need a device to tell me I have slept badly. But I have a problem, because my health tracking data has become about more than my own curiosity and good intentions.\nA few years ago, in a fit of grownupness inspired by new fatherhood – and my dad’s early death 20 years ago – I took out life insurance. Like many policies, it links premiums to lifestyles rather than crude metrics such as age and life expectancy. My Garmin account, to which my watch transmitted my step counts and activities, is linked to my policy.\nI win points daily by walking far enough or burning calories during activities, as estimated by the rises in my heart rate measured by a smartwatch. My annual points total affects my insurance status and premiums. The more active I am, the less likely I am to die young – and the less I pay.\nWhile my lifestyle hasn’t changed since my Garmin died, my insurer thinks I have become idle and therefore at greater risk of life-shortening conditions. It hasn’t contacted me, but if I go on like this, without collecting points, I could face higher premiums.\nSuch quandaries will only become more common and complex, says Btihaj Ajana, a reader in media and digital culture at King’s College London and a specialist in self-tracking. She traces our tracking instincts in the digital age to the “quantified self” movement. It took shape in 2007 as a way for individuals to use technology to optimise themselves like machines. “What started as a positive phenomenon then got hijacked,” Ajana says.\nConstant advances in tracking have given tech companies new ways to keep selling their latest devices, while happily collecting the data we generate and sign away without reading the terms and conditions. “You don’t own that data,” Ajana says. Apple promises to encrypt and guard the multiplying streams of health data it collects for us. But much of the concern about privacy in this growing market is what we consent to share with third-party apps and services that have their own privacy policies. “We are so blase about privacy,” Ajana says.\nIt is easy to imagine the value of health data not only to insurers, but also advertisers and employers. Around 2014, a number of big businesses started giving Fitbits to staff, collecting information on their sleep, activity and location. The rise of corporate tracking, which is presented as an employee perk (free watch! Better health!), may be hastened by Covid. LifeSignals, a California startup that has developed a chest patch to measure signals including breathing, temperature and even posture, noted a spike in demand last year from big businesses that wanted to screen staff for Covid symptoms.\n“Some employers ask employees to compete with each other to be more healthy,” Ajana adds. “It can all seem benign and nice – but what if that data also gets used to decide who gets the next promotion or whose health insurance policy needs adjusting?” Opting out of such programmes can feel like a career risk of its own.\nMeanwhile, the range of data that is being gathered and assessed grows. NatureQuant, a startup in Oregon, is developing an app to track and rate the time we spend outside – not how many steps, but where we step, based on the well-established health benefits of fresh air and green space.\nThe company gathers data, including satellite imagery, street-view photography, road densities and measures of air pollution, to score any location (so far only in the US). GPS location tracking then pairs user and place. Going for a walk, for example, would earn you a “nature dose” in minutes, towards a 120-minute weekly goal, and a “nature score” based on how green and pleasant it was.\nSleep easy? Our every breath is monitored. Photograph: 10’000 Hours\/Getty Images\nNatureQuant is open about wider interest in its data. “We’re in conversations with big insurance providers to provide NatureDose as a tool to improve population health,” says Jared Hanley, the company’s CEO. Employers are also keen, as are property developers who might use nature scores to identify and promote new sites.\nPrivacy policies vary between health apps, many of which tap into the sensors and hardware developed by device manufacturers. Earlier this year, the New York Times analysed the policies of 250 iPhone apps, including 20 health and fitness apps. Thirteen of these apps shared data with an average of three third-party trackers, many of which passed data to advertisers.\nThe apps included Flo, a period and fertility tracking app used by more than 100 million women. In January, Flo agreed to a settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission after it had been exposed for sharing health data – including users’ period timings and declared intention to conceive within the app – with advertising tech companies including Facebook. Flo had not given users an opt-out for such sharing, something it has now agreed to do as part of the settlement. Flo did not admit to any wrongdoing, and denied sharing users’ names, addresses or birthdays, saying in a statement: “We are committed to ensuring that the privacy of our users’ personal health data is absolutely paramount.”\nDouglas says MyLevels does not sell or share any personal data, relying instead on subscriptions. Yet she has been courted by investors “pushing for different business models … You can imagine advertising targeting you when your glucose levels are crashing,” she says.\nFor advocates of health tracking, the risk of sacrificing data is worth taking. “There is no digital health revolution without breaching some of our privacy,” says Bertalan Meskó, a “geek physician” who, as the director of the Medical Futurist Institute, studies the way technology can change healthcare.\nMeskó envisages a not-too-distant era in which “digital tattoos” send health data streams to our smartphones. An app would alert us to worrying symptoms and arrange appointments with digital doctors, which would prescribe personalised medicines based on our data and genomic sequences. Medicines will be 3D-printed in precise formulations. “And you’ve probably just saved yourself from hospitalisation or even a major medical incident,” he says.\nMeskó struggles to understand heightened fears of health data sharing. “We use tech every day that has for years been a threat to our privacy, yet here is tech that could promise a better life and now you have concerns?”\nEven if tracking might eventually help spot symptoms early, the extent to which it nudges us into better behaviour is moot. While some studies have shown step-counting, for example, can boost motivation and activity, others have questioned its overall effect on the population, particularly after the novelty wears off.\nThere is also concern about the precision and side-effects of health tracking. In 2018, Apple added an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor to its Watch. Until then, such monitors were used in hospitals to detect abnormal heart rhythms. Now, anyone can be alerted to potential problems, but the US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts in disease prevention, has recommended against ECG use in healthy people.\nDoctors have expressed concerns, for example, about the accuracy of such tracking, and risks associated with further screening prompted by an alert – as well as the potential for health tracking to induce anxiety or obsessive behaviour. “GPs are under immense workload pressure and it’s important they aren’t overloaded with patients submitting readings from smartwatches and fitness trackers if they have not been asked to do so,” says Dr Michael Mulholland, the vice-chair of the Royal College of GPs.\nBerry, the nutritionist, says glucose responses to food can guide someone towards healthier eating as part of a bigger picture. “But the worrying thing is, if you became obsessed with it, you could reduce your glycemic variability [blood-sugar spikes] while eating bacon and eggs every day and your fat response would be all over the place.”\nDouglas, who says glucose tracking has helped her stabilise her own weight, is aware of the risks of potentially obsessive behaviour in vulnerable customers. MyLevels does not recommend weight loss as a goal to customers whose body-mass index is below 18.5, which is categorised as underweight, she says, but adds: “I honestly think it will do more good for people, as it has for myself.”\nI, meanwhile, will continue to wait for the new Apple Watch, with all its promise as a virtual nurse, and then decide if I really need it. How will I balance the convenience and potential benefits to my health and insurance premiums of a smartwatch against the instincts of a burgeoning industry of data gluttons in big tech and advertising? Do I really need digital confirmation of a bad night’s sleep or a lazy day? While I ponder these questions, the only thing I can share is the time.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to privacy concerns related to health tracking and data collection.

{"num":76,"Time":"4 minute read\nPublished 1:31 PM EDT, Thu June 1, 2023","Title":"Reddit sparks outrage after a popular app developer said it wants him to pay $20 million a year for data access","Content":"Washington\nCNN\n — \nTwitter has been widely criticized for trying to charge transit agencies, third-party app developers and academics for data access to its platform, a move opponents say has forced independent apps to shut down and threatened research on misinformation and hate speech.\nNow, a similar revolt against Reddit may be gaining steam after a popular app developer said Wednesday the social media company wants to charge him $20 million a year to continue offering software that lets Reddit users view and interact with the platform.\nThe newly unveiled pricing of Reddit’s paywall “is close to Twitter pricing” and is not “anything based in reality or remotely reasonable,” said Christian Selig, developer of the Apollo app, in a Reddit post on Wednesday. “It goes without saying that I don’t have that kind of money or would even know how to charge it to a credit card.”\nSelig’s post highlights a plan Reddit announced in April to enact a Twitter-like pricing structure for its application programming interface (API) — the software that allows other programs to tap into the company’s data, including posts and comments. Reddit’s API is what allows Reddit content to be displayed to the Apollo app’s 900,000 daily active users.\nTwitter accuses Microsoft of refusing to pay for tweets and abusing its data access\nReddit’s initial announcement had been light on pricing details, leaving many to speculate about the future of third-party access to Reddit. As details of its pricing plan trickled out on Wednesday, Reddit did not dispute Selig’s account of his conversations with the company, but said Reddit remains “committed to fostering a safe and responsible developer ecosystem.”\n“Expansive access to data has impact and costs involved, and in terms of safety and privacy we have an obligation to our communities to be responsible stewards of data,” said Tim Rathschmidt, a company spokesperson, in an email.\nSelig’s tweet on the issue has been viewed more than one million times and has led to an outpouring of criticism for Reddit. “Apollo is the only reason I use Reddit,” one fan of the app tweeted. Another said: “Reddit is going full Twitter and it’s a big mistake.” .\nSelig had initially expressed cautious optimism about the company’s plan, saying on the day of the announcement that he had spoken to the company and that if the new moves were implemented reasonably, “this could be a positive change.”\nBut now, a month later, Selig’s optimism has deflated. According to Selig’s post Wednesday, Reddit intends to charge $12,000 for every 50 million attempts to access the company’s data.\nReddit's paywall \"is close to Twitter pricing\" and is not \"anything based in reality or remotely reasonable,\" said Christian Selig, developer of the Apollo app, in a Reddit post on Wednesday.\n“Apollo made 7 billion requests last month,” Selig wrote Wednesdsay, meaning his additional costs simply for running his business as usual would add up to “1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per year.”\n“I’d be in the red every month,” he added. Selig didn’t immediately respond to questions from CNN about whether he expects to have to shut down the app.\nSelig isn’t the only app developer crying foul. Some developers have said Reddit’s API changes would also block ads in third-party apps, potentially depriving apps of ad revenue and forcing them to try to convert users to subscription business models.\nPart of the motivation for Reddit’s plan involves the surging popularity of artificial intelligence.\nLarge language models such as ChatGPT are developed using training data, which in many cases is sourced from content found across the internet. Reddit should not be expected to provide that data to “some of the largest companies in the world for free,” CEO Steve Huffman told the New York Times in a recent interview.\nMeanwhile, Reddit is also widely expected to go public, potentially as soon as this year. The stock offering could add to pressure for Reddit to show revenue growth. Its paid API could help on that front.\nBut that could come at the expense of independent apps and, as some pointed out, Reddit users who may experience a loss of choices in ways to access the platform. Some predicted that they might soon have to rely on Reddit’s proprietary app, which has been widely panned by users, if they wish to access the site at all.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the JSON format analysis of the news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant because it discusses Reddit's intention to charge a popular app developer $20 million a year for data access to its platform.

{"num":69,"Time":"Wed 2 Feb 2022 12.45 CET","Title":"TechScape: Google is changing how it tracks us online – but who benefits?","Content":"Cookies are one of the many questionable pacts we have made online, where privacy is exchanged for convenience without being entirely sure about the consequences. As with so many arrangements involving our data, this deal is being rewritten under the gaze of regulators.\nLast week Google issued an update on how it is replacing cookies on its Chrome browser, which is important because two-thirds of web browsing around the world is on Chrome.\nSign up for our weekly technology newsletter, TechScape.\nPut simply, a cookie is a text file that is dropped into your browser by a website when you visit it. In the UK and EU, you are asked to consent to multiple cookies when you click on a site (and yes it’s worth checking just how many cookies you agree to take on when you give your consent).\nThe new head of the UK’s data watchdog, John Edwards, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme last week – on international data privacy day – that he is no fan of the consent-clicking process. “That’s not a very effective way of rebalancing the power relationship between consumers and companies that profit from consumers’ data,” he said.\nCookie monsters\nCookies identify individual users so the website can record all kinds of things about your activity. Some of this info is helpful, like whether you have logged in to the site before, so you don’t have to constantly enter your user name and password every time you visit in the future. This sort of thing is known as a first party cookie.\nHowever, there are types of this technology known as third party cookies that facilitate the storing of information (like your browsing history and your location) by commercial partners – often marketing or advertising businesses – that might make you slightly more uncomfortable. If you check the cookie consent box on any website, you will be surprised at the number of advertising and marketing-related cookies. Third party cookies, through agreements with multiple publishers and websites, are able to create a profile of individual users and serve targeted adverts to you while you browse across multiple websites. Like other news publishers, the Guardian asks readers if it can use cookies, for purposes such as measuring how often readers visit and use our site, and showing readers personalised ads.\nIn what appears to be a win for privacy advocates and a blow to publishers, advertisers and the intermediaries that facilitate personalised ads across the web, third party cookies are being phased out across the board. This is in part due to pressure from regulators and pro-privacy laws like GDPR. Apple and Mozilla have blocked third party cookies on their Safari and Firefox browsers and Google is doing the same on Chrome by 2023.\nLeaving the FLoC behind\nGoogle is replacing third party cookies with a set of technologies called a privacy sandbox and last week it announced it was changing one of the key proposals. The initial plan was to bundle people into groups (cohorts) with similar interests based on their browsing habits and allow advertisers to serve ads to those groups. This was called FLoC, for Federated Learning of Cohorts.\nAfter feedback from the industry, which included warnings that individuals could still be identified as they browsed across the web under the FLoC system, Google is now proposing a different system. It is called Topics, in which the Chrome browser notes your top interests for that week based on your browsing history and registers them in the browser (like a cookie would) under broad categories like “fitness” or “travel”, which are limited in number. Advertisers and publishers are able to access this data via a browser API, which is a feed of information that they can tap into.\nThen when users visit a site that has signed up to the system, three of the user’s “topics” of interest are shared with the site and its advertisers, allowing the site to serve ads that reflect the user’s interest in, for instance, rock music or cars.\nGoogle said the topics will not include sensitive categories such as gender or race and the system will allow users to see the topics, remove any they don’t like or disable the feature completely. The topics are deleted every three weeks.\nIn the UK the Competition and Markets Authority and the Information Commissioner’s Office are looking at the proposals, from a competition and privacy perspective (ie are there disadvantages for Google’s rivals in provision of online adverts and will users’ data be abused). Rivals are also concerned that Google, which has said other parts of its business like YouTube will adhere to these changes, still has a basic advantage through the sheer amount of existing data it has on users. Vinay Goel, the Google product director in charge of the sandbox project, says: “We have developed these new proposals in the open, seeking feedback at every step to ensure that they work for everyone, without preferential treatment or advantage to Google’s advertising products or to Google’s own sites.”\nAccording to the Open Rights Group, which campaigns for people’s digital rights, Google’s new proposals signal an end to the data gold rush under third party cookies. “Conducting behavioural profiling in the browser could constitute an alternative to the existing data-free-for-all model, where your browsing activities are broadcasted to thousands of unknown intermediaries,” says Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at ORG.\nHowever, the ORG remains concerned over several issues including the lack of a default opt-in stance, which would see a browser omitted from the scheme unless they chose to be included. This is still behavioural profiling, says the ORG.\nGoogle adds: “We started the Privacy Sandbox initiative to improve web privacy for users, and Topics will allow for users to have greater control over relevant ads without sharing sensitive details such as gender or race.”\nNobody’s happy – so everybody wins\nIt is a big change for the digital advertising industry. Farhad Divecha, managing director of UK digital marketing agency Accuracast, wonders if the shift will satisfy anyone. “Privacy advocates are going to feel that this is still not quite enough, because there’s reasons why this is still tracking behaviour. And on the flip side, advertisers are going to say you’re taking away stuff from me. And you’re taking away my ability to target specifically whom I want to be reaching.”\nPaul Bannister, chief strategy officer at US digital ad management firm CafeMedia, says the momentum nonetheless is with privacy. “I think the pendulum has swung pretty far towards privacy here.” But he adds: “because it’s easier to understand the topics system, hopefully it will be more something that users feel good about. And if users are happier with the outcome that is better for advertisers, because it makes people more supportive of what their data is being used for.”\nThis could be just the beginning – as internet users become more aware of that trade off between privacy and convenience, and regulators continue to challenge the marketing industry upon which much of big tech profits rely, the pendulum could swing further.\nIf you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"This news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage.

{"num":63,"Time":null,"Title":"What your smart TV knows about you – and how to stop it harvesting data","Content":"W\natching TV feels like a benign pastime, but as all TVs become “smart” – connected to the internet via your router – they are gaining the ability to watch you too. As soon as you switch them on, smart TVs made by the likes of LG, Samsung and Sony are gathering data from the TV itself, as well as from the operating system and apps. Then there are the devices you plug into your TV, such as Google’s Chromecast, Apple TV and Amazon’s Fire Stick.\nA TV is no longer just a device for showing you content – it has become a two-way mirror allowing you to be observed in real time by a network of advertisers and data brokers, says Rowenna Fielding, director of data protection consultancy Miss IG Geek. “The purpose of this is to gather as much information as possible about your behaviour, interests, preferences and demographics so it can be monetised, mainly through targeted advertising.”\nSmart TV spying is difficult to avoid. A study by researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London found data from TVs and smart devices was sent to Google’s ad business and to Netflix, even if people didn’t have Netflix.\nWhat does your smart TV know about you?\nThe data collected by your smart TV depends on its manufacturer, brand and version. In theory, most smart TVs are capable of collecting audio, video and TV usage data, says Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at cybersecurity company Darktrace.\nVoice activation is one feature with the potential to gather large amounts of data. Microphones and software are listening for instructions and they can capture conversations and other sounds within range. These recordings might be sent to third parties to be analysed.\nCross-device tracking is another issue to consider. Data collected via your smart TV is more valuable when combined with information from other smart devices such as mobile phones, laptops and home automation gear, according to Fielding. “This allows individuals to be profiled in detail: geo-location history, web browsing activity and social media information can be added to TV data.”\nThen there are the cookies and trackers. Apps and browsers on smart TVs use cookie- and pixel-tracking technologies just like websites do to track, recognise and identify devices for user-profiling. “Most apps installed on your smart TV will be snitching to a large network of advertisers and data brokers,” Fielding warns.\nWhat does your TV do with the data?\nThere is no clear-cut answer. What exactly is done with the data is complex and “highly opaque”, says Lewis. “When looking at what a smart TV does on the network, it is often unclear why certain data is being harvested and where it is being sent.”\nThere is not much difference between TV brands. Manufacturers claim to use your information for “personalisation” and quality of content, but it is common to sell this type of data, anonymised or semi-anonymised, to third parties, advertising companies or streaming services. “After the data has been sold, it is out of the manufacturer’s control,” Lewis says. “It is often unclear what data exactly is being sent back, depending on the T&Cs and privacy settings, and it can be very difficult to change default settings once you have agreed to them.”\nHow streaming services are also gathering data\nUsing streaming services on a smart TV is another surefire way to hand over lots of your personal data. Apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Now TV tend to claim they only use data for necessary services such as recommendations or credit checks. But this can include data such as device identifiers, geo-location, browser type, email address and payment information.\nNetflix’s powerful recommendations algorithm fuels the quality of its service by helping you choose which shows to watch. If you log on to Netflix via your browser, you can tweak the privacy settings to limit the data that’s collected and shared. Yet most of the data Netflix gathers, such as the shows you watched and when, is so core to its service that you can’t opt out of it.\nWhat is automatic content recognition or ACR?\nBack to the smart TV itself. One scary feature to look out for is automated content recognition (ACR). Often turned on by default, this uses analytical techniques to identify video and audio running on the TV, matching it against a big database to identify what’s being played. It’s pretty creepy stuff – ACR works on anything played on the TV including DVDs and Blu-rays, CDs and games.\nViewing data and habits are shared with manufacturers and ultimately sold to advertisers in order to target you with ads, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security company ESET. When your TV is connected to your home router, data will include your IP address and location too, he adds.\nAnd in theory, ACR could be used for even more unsettling profiling, says Lewis. “With the analytical technologies available, data from facial recognition, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text and content analysis could be gathered to build an in-depth picture of an individual user.”\nInstead of matching content against a list of known movies, ACR could in theory be analysed for political position, ethnicity, socioeconomic position and other things that could be abused in the wrong hands, Lewis says.\nShould you use your TV as a browser or your smartphone as a TV remote?\nUsing the browser on your TV might be convenient, but it’s a major attack target for hackers. This is because your smart TV browser lacks the antivirus and additional security settings built into your smartphone or PC.\n“Cyber-attackers can eavesdrop on the browser’s traffic and compromise the cookies that manage authentication to online services, such as social media accounts or online banking, and impersonate people,” says Dr Francisco Navarro, a senior lecturer at De Montfort University’s Cyber Security Centre in Leicester.\nBut in contrast, experts say using your smartphone as a TV remote is fine. Just be mindful that connecting to a smart TV with a mobile will be done via Bluetooth or across the network, says James Griffiths, cofounder and technical director at security consultancy Cyber Security Associates. “If the smart TV was hacked, it might be used to attack your mobile device, but the risk of this happening is low.”\nProtect yourself from smart TV spying\nAs long as they are connected to the internet, smart TVs will collect data and you can’t stop this from happening altogether. In many instances it’s not in your interests to do so as it will affect your viewing experience – take Netflix’s useful recommendations features as an example.\nYet there are some basic measures you can take to protect yourself from smart TV spying. Turn off ACR in the settings, disable personalisation, opt out of all advertising features and cover or disable cameras and microphones.\nIt’s also important to make sure your router is protected by changing the password and setting up a guest network. You can improve security by opting out of web tracking when it’s offered and applying software updates as soon as they’re available.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage.

Marketing\nIt is well-known that companies use loyalty card data to understand shoppers' habits.\nThis is not new, and many customers understand this is a core part of the reward card relationship.\nLoyalty card data helps retailers understand people's behaviour and then shape it by targeting advertising and organising products to encourage more sales.\n2. Tracking movements\nIn order to get a loyalty card, customers have to register their name, address and date of birth - and sometimes other information.\nScanning the reward card at a shop checkout or entering the card number while shopping online allows companies to track purchases and make a link between people shopping in store and on the web.\nIt means retailers can create an accurate picture of when, where and how people do their shopping.\n3. Building a 'profile'\nRetailers can enrich the data they have collected from reward cards by buying customer data from third-party companies, known as data brokers.\nThese third-party companies amass information from a variety of sources to create \"profiles\" of people with information about habits, patterns and personality.\nRetailers can then match their loyalty card data to these profiles, producing a clearer picture of shoppers.\n4. Sharing with other brands\nAll organisations processing personal data must comply with data protection law and each company has a data privacy policy.\n\"This will include details of what data they can collect, how it can be used, and whether (as well as to whom) the data can be sold on,\" Dr Garfield Benjamin from the University of Birmingham's centre for Cyber Security and Privacy explained.\n\"There is an increasing need for greater transparency in this process - we all click 'agree' to lengthy and often confusing terms and conditions without necessarily being able to understand them.\"\nAlthough stores will often not pass loyalty scheme data to other parties, they may share customers' information with companies within the same group, which can be global.\nSome companies may also share the information with their retail partners, who can use it to target their advertising.\nNectar, for example, can share data with at least 49 companies including Argos and Easyjet, according to consumer group Which?\nData protection law is changing from May, when the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force - changing the way organisations have to look after our personal data.\n'Mass exploitation' or 'social good'?\nCampaign group Privacy International said it is concerned about the \"hidden data infrastructure\".\n\"Loyalty cards are not a new thing, but the volume of data available to advertisers and companies... combined with the bloated nature of companies vying for access to data is resulting in essentially the mass exploitation of people's data,\" the privacy organisation said.\nIt said retailers and third-party companies \"hoover up information from a variety of sources\" to create profiles, wanting to \"know you better than you know yourself\".\n\"This picture of who you are, what your motivations are, who you want to become, can all be used to nudge you to purchase something or even behave in a certain way.\"\nBut Prof Paul Longley, who is one of a group of academics working at the Consumer Data Research Centre, said the so-called \"big data\" can \"definitely be used for the social good\".\n\"We hear a lot about invasion of individual privacy and people being manipulated by such sources. But new big data sources can be used for the benefit of all,\" he said.\n\"So, for example, we may use smart meter energy data to enable analysis of fuel poverty, or loyalty card data or smart card data to look at how mobile people are around the country.\"\nMore on this story\nA day without data\nPublished\n29 October 2014","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here's the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": [\n    \"The news is relevant to privacy concerns.\",\n    \"The article discusses how companies use loyalty card data, which can involve collecting and analyzing personal information.\",\n    \"Companies use loyalty card data to understand shoppers' habits and behaviors.\",\n    \"Retailers can track shoppers' movements through loyalty cards, both in-store and online.\",\n    \"Retailers can build profiles of shoppers by enriching loyalty card data with information from third-party companies.\",\n    \"There is a mention of data protection law and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into force, indicating the importance of privacy regulations.\",\n    \"Privacy International expresses concerns about the mass exploitation of people's data through loyalty card programs.\"\n  ]\n}\nThis news is relevant to privacy concerns as it discusses how companies use loyalty card data to track and analyze customers' behaviors, build profiles, and potentially share this information with third parties.

{"num":72,"Time":"Fri 25 Dec 2015 18.00 CET","Title":"Hyde Park visitors covertly tracked via mobile phone data","Content":"Visitors to Hyde Park, one of London’s most famous tourist spots, were covertly tracked via their mobile phone signals in a trial undertaken by the Royal Parks to analyse footfall amid drastic funding cuts. Officials were able to retrospectively locate park-goers for 12 months using anonymised mobile phone data provided by the network operator EE via a third party.\nAggregated age and gender data was also made available during the initiative. If a zone of the park contained more than 50 people at once, it was possible to “drill down” to the aggregated demographic data of visitors to that area too, creating a detailed picture of how different people used the park in previous months.\nThe third party which supplied the phone-tracking service, Future Cities Catapult (FCC) – a government-funded initiative which focuses on urban renewal – harvested data that officials from the Royal Parks said allowed them to review the number of visitors to Hyde Park and their distribution on a heat map.\nThe data also showed the percentage of people to have visited from different boroughs, towns and cities.\nLondon garden bridge users to have mobile phone signals tracked\nRead more\nEE triangulated visitors’ locations from local mobile phone masts and sold the data to FCC, which has been tasked with the transformation of Hyde Park’s technology. Only EE users were captured in the trial.\nThe trial took place from August 2014 to August 2015 and used mobile data with a four-week delay, according to EE.\nColin Buttery, deputy chief executive at the Royal Parks, told the Guardian the organisation could benefit from up-to-date methods to measure visitors: “It would be great to find out how many people are in the park today, but that is very much blue-sky thinking.”\nBut Buttery added that it would not be possible to use mobile data for same-day visitor counts, while EE confirmed all its mobile data was sold with a four-week delay.\nThe Royal Parks and FCC said location data could inform policing of crowds at large events, tailor amenities to park usage and protect the ecology of the park, which was visited 12.8m times in 2014.\nThe trial follows a decade of severe cuts to the Royal Parks’ government funding and a period of rapid diversification of its offering to visitors, including the launch of events such as Winter Wonderland, the annual festival and theme park, which attracted 4.5 million visitors to Hyde Park last year.\nA ferris wheel at Winter Wonderland, which is one of the money-spinning events Hyde Park holds to make up its government funding shortfall. Photograph: Han Yan\/Xinhua Press\/Corbis\nThe Royal Parks’ government funding has fallen to an all-time low, while visitor numbers have hit record highs. State funding for the eight parks dropped from approximately 80% of total revenue 10 years ago to just 35% last year.\nThe number of visitors has nearly doubled to 77 million during the same period, making it the most popular urban parkland in the world.\nThe deal with FCC is one of a number of ways to help the parks plan ways of raising revenue to assist with their £35m annual operating costs, which have not increased over the past 10 years despite inflation. New cafes, shops and galleries also compensate for the funding shortfall.\nThe Hyde Park initiative shares similarities with plans to track visitors to London’s private garden bridge, revealed by the Guardian in November.\nUsman Haque, co-founder of Thingful, a search engine for the Internet of Things, said: “The notion of public spaces includes within it some notion of being anonymous within that space. When you don’t have the option of defining that anonymity for yourself, I would argue your rights have been taken away.”\nBBC News staff voice concern over corporation tracking mobile devices\nRead more\nEE discloses in its privacy policy that it shares aggregated personal data about sales, customers and traffic patterns to third parties and says that the statistics will not include any information that “is likely to identify you”.\nThe sale of location and demographic data has become big business for mobile phone carriers, which are looking for new ways to generate revenue.\nCustomers are increasingly accessing “over the top” services such as Skype and WhatsApp through mobile internet data, which carries a lower profit margin than call minutes or multimedia messaging. According to AdAge, third-party data sharing now represents a $24bn (£16bn) industry.\nIn addition to providing mobile data, FCC also deployed soil moisture sensors and air pollution kits to monitor Hyde Park’s environmental status. Buttery said FCC’s work was just one way the Royal Parks was attempting to boost sustainability and protect the natural ecology while raising self-generated revenue.\nA Royal Parks spokesman said: “Future Cities Catapult is very much a research project to which we have provided a venue for them to carry out a range of investigations including air, soil and water quality.\n“While it would be useful to know how visitors use the park for future management, such as the provision of activities and amenities, and to protect the wildlife, we do not have plans to track real-time data of visitors through mobile phone data.\n“The visitor data we saw as part of this project was several months old and was simply dots on a screen which showed us the flow of visitors. Any research of our visitors is carried out through official market research data.”\nScott Cain, chief business officer at FCC, said: “The work we do is around innovation that makes cities better. We take a human-centered designed approach to engage with people.\n“In Hyde Park we were looking to help the park manage its resources and ecology more efficiently as well as tailor its service provision to the way in which the public actually use the park.”\nAn EE spokesman said: “Big data has proven to be a highly effective method of improving infrastructure and public services. We worked as part of the Sensing London project to inform the better use of the royal parks and provide greater understanding of the needs of park users.\n“This would include providing anonymous and retrospective network usage data of large groups of people – without ever intruding on the privacy of individuals.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage.

It paid just £5.1m in corporation tax last year in the UK, despite revenues quadrupling to £842.4m for the year to 31 December.\nFacebook was among those recently told by the EU to do more and faster to remove extremist and hate content from its platform, or face regulation.

{"num":87,"Time":"5 minute read\nUpdated 5:28 AM EDT, Tue April 27, 2021","Title":"Apple’s major privacy change is here. What you need to know","Content":"CNN Business\n — \nApple rolled out a major privacy feature on Monday that will allow iOS users to decide how they want their personal data handled — a move that has worried some companies, including Facebook.\niOS users must now give explicit permission for apps to track their behavior and sell their personal data, such as age, location, spending habits and health information, to advertisers. While many apps have allowed people to manage or opt-out of this for years, it’s typically buried deep in user settings and wordy privacy policies.\nThe new App Tracking Transparency feature, now available as an iOS 14.5 software update, will usher in a wave of privacy awareness, especially as permission requests start coming in from apps people never thought were tracking them.\nDevelopers are now required to ask users via a pop-up alert if they can “track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites.” People who opt-out will see fewer personalized ads. The app developer controls when the prompt appears. And once a user makes their choice, they can change their mind in the settings.\nAlthough some data can help users map their runs, tag photos or track locations so a store nearby can offer up discounts, “some apps have more trackers embedded in them than they need,” Apple said in a video posted to YouTube on Monday. “They collect thousands of pieces of information about you to create a digital profile that they sell to others. These third parties use your profile to target you with ads, and they can also use it to predict and influence your behaviors and decisions.”\n“This has been happening without your knowledge or permission. Your information is for sale. You have become the product,” Apple said in the video.\nApple’s effort has roiled some businesses that rely on data tracking to target users with personalized advertising. Facebook (FB), which makes almost all of its revenue from advertising, warned investors in August that Apple’s software changes could hurt its business if people start opting-out of tracking.\n“People are going to have a bit of a fire inside them and jump to opt-out of Facebook selling their data,” Mike Audi, founder and CEO of TIKI, a service that allows users to see what data and how companies are tracking them online. “The result is that brands we’d actually want to share our data with may no longer get the data they rely on to provide you with a seamless, hyper-personalized customer experience.”\nNo, the new iMac isn't ugly. The design and colors are a breath of fresh air\nIn December, Facebook took out ads in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post framing its objections around how the change will cause “devastating” harm to millions of small businesses that advertise on its platform, many of which are grappling with the fallout from the pandemic. It also held a press event to trot out small businesses opposed to the change and debuted a new hashtag to discuss it.\nApple teased the requirement at its Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June. The company has worked to position itself as a defender of consumer privacy, describing the changes as stemming from its belief that “privacy is a fundamental human right.”\nApple (AAPL) added new labels in December to its App Store that explain what kind of user data is collected and shared for each app, from financial and location information to browsing and purchase history.\nThe business impact\nData experts say large companies like Facebook and other well-known brands will have to work to navigate the changes, but it’s the small to medium-sized businesses that may not have certain resources, such as dedicated analytics teams and engineers, that could struggle more to reach potential customers.\n“Many small businesses take advantage of data sharing to target and measure ads on Facebook and Instagram,” said Eric Schmitt, senior director analyst at market research firm Gartner. “It is fair to say that the benefits of digital advertising to some of these businesses will decline.”\nFacebook has tried to tout the benefits of data collection ahead of Apple’s privacy change. “Agreeing to these prompts doesn’t result in Facebook collecting new types of data. It just means that we can continue to give people better experiences,” it wrote in a blog post in February.\nMeanwhile, Google (GOOG) announced changes to its ad policies ahead of Apple’s new feature earlier this year, noting it will no longer use certain identifiers for advertising – such as showing you an ad for a bike that you’ve previously searched for. “We are working hard to understand and comply with Apple’s guidelines for all of our apps in the App Store,” the company said at the time.\nAirTag could give a nice bump to Apple's growing lineup of smaller stuff\nVarious studies show that when given the opportunity to opt-out of their data being sold or shared, many people will take that route. But companies will likely adapt.\n“I’m confident businesses, especially Facebook, will come out just fine after the app tracking transparency functionality rolls out,” said Daniel Barber, CEO of data management firm DataGrail. “Change spurs innovation, and I expect Facebook, ad-tech companies, and any other businesses impacted by this to find innovative new ways to communicate with their audiences.\nHe said heightened awareness around data privacy could also put more pressure on government officials to develop a federal bill to protect user privacy.\nStill, Apple’s iOS change marks the start of a more transparent future, as consumers will be even more aware about how apps handle their data. “The most exciting part is users will start to expect and demand more control over their data,” said Audi. “The fastest way to get a company to make a change is for their users to get upset.”","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage.

Its research found that 84% of car companies review, share or sell data collected from car owners.\nMozilla found that all the car brands it reviewed collected more personal data than necessary and personal information collected was used for reasons unrelated to the operation of a vehicle and a car brand’s relationship with its drivers.\nThe Mozilla research suggests that six car companies can collect intimate information, including a driver’s medical information and genetic information. How fast a person drives, where they drive to and the songs they listen to in their car were also included.\nNissan includes “sexual activity”, in the data it collects and Kia notes that it can collect information about your “sex life” in their privacy policy, Mozilla said.\nKia’s privacy policy states it may process “special categories” of data, including “information about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, sex life and political opinions” and “trade union membership”.\nCars can collect personal information from drivers in huge quantities, from the connected services that can be used in the car, to third-party sources such as online radio service Sirius XM or Google Maps. That data can then be used to “invent more data about you through inferences about things like your intelligence, abilities and interests”, Mozilla said.\nWhile the car industry has been focused on the shift from petrol and diesel engines to battery electric propulsion in recent years, some analysts argue that greater disruption is ahead as vehicles become increasingly connected to the internet, and capable of autonomous driving.\nThat has led to predictions of a massive rise in the sales of services such as music and video streaming as well as driver assistance and self-driving subscriptions. Consultancy McKinsey has forecast that carmakers could make as much as $1.5tn (£1.2tn) in extra revenues by embracing new services ranging from ride hailing, to in-car apps and wireless software upgrades.\nHowever, many services could be much more lucrative for carmakers if they collect more data on customers.\nUnder Mozilla’s criteria, Tesla failed all of the reviews that looked at security, data control and AI. The US electric car company has already faced criticism over its privacy practices. It emerged earlier this year that employees had shared videos and images recorded by the cameras in customers’ cars.

{"num":86,"Time":"Wed 19 Dec 2018 15.41 CET","Title":"Facebook shared private user messages with Netflix and Spotify","Content":"Facebook gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read and even delete users’ private messages, a new investigation has revealed.\nThe social media giant granted major companies far more exceptions to its privacy policies than previously known, making user data available through loopholes to companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Sony.\nThe loopholes, reported by the New York Times, suggest a company that was prepared to bend its own rules to keep valuable partners onside.\nFacebook gave Netflix, Spotify and the Royal Bank of Canada the ability to read, write and delete users’ private messages; it gave Microsoft, Sony and Amazon the ability to obtain email addresses of their users’ friends as late as 2017; and it gave device manufacturers such as Apple the ability to build special features that plugged into the social network.\nThe New York Times investigation revealed that it had itself been one of the companies granted access to some of the Facebook user data.\nThe arrangements bypassed Facebook’s typical privacy protections, making it harder for users to determine where and how their data was being shared by using the tools Facebook had made available for that purpose.\nIn a statement, Facebook said: “None of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people’s permission, nor did they violate our 2012 settlement with the FTC.”\nSome of the reported loopholes were more or less transparent to the end user, and may even have enabled fairer competition. For instance, an integration with Apple allowed iPhone users to link their Facebook calendars with their phone calendars, even if they had changed settings to disable all sharing. The information, Apple says, never went to its servers, instead simply sitting on the iPhone of the Facebook user, allowing them to check upcoming events without opening the Facebook app.\nIn other cases, Facebook appears to have granted companies far more access than they needed to build the user-focused features, and relied on trust to ensure the access wasn’t abused. Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada, for instance, were granted access to read, write and delete private messages on the Facebook platform. That access was granted to allow the companies to build their own unique implementations of a private message feature, allowing users to, for instance, send a Facebook message linking to a song.\nBut even the companies themselves seemed surprised by the extent of the rights Facebook had given away. Apple told the Guardian it was not aware that Facebook had granted its devices any special access. Spotify, too, said it was not aware of the broad powers Facebook had handed over.\nNetflix replied to the story in a tweet, saying that it “never asked for, or accessed, anyone’s private messages. We’re not the type to slide into your DMs.”\nDamian Collins, the chair of the UK’s DCMS committee, said the news “shows that Facebook offers preferential access to user data to some of its major corporate partners. The scale of the business these companies do with Facebook underpins the value of their relationship. Facebook rewards these firms with data privileges that other organisations do not enjoy.”\nCollins’ parliamentary committee had previously revealed similar arrangements after obtaining internal Facebook emails that showed the company considering special access for partners including Tinder and the Royal Bank of Canada.\n“We have to seriously challenge the claim by Facebook that they are not selling user data,” he added. “They may not be letting people take it away by the bucket-load, but they do reward companies with access to data that others are denied, if they place a high value on the business they do together. This is just another form of selling.\n“We remain concerned as well about Facebook’s ability to police what happens to user data when it is shared with developers, as was highlighted by the Cambridge Analytica data breach.”\nIn its statement, Facebook listed a number of ways that it said companies used the special access they were given:\nApps that allowed people to access their Facebook account on their Windows Phone device.\nNotifications about their activity on Facebook that they could turn on while they were using Safari or other browsers.\n“Social hubs” that consolidated their feeds across Facebook, Twitter, and other services.\nMessaging integrations that allowed people to recommend things like songs from Spotify to friends.\nSearch results in Bing and elsewhere based on public information their friends shared.\nTools that helped them find friends on Facebook by uploading their contacts from email providers like Yahoo.\nThe social network also highlighted, however, that “most of these features are now gone. We shut down instant personalisation, which powered Bing’s features, in 2014 and we wound down our partnerships with device and platform companies months ago, following an announcement in April. Still, we recognise that we’ve needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information using our APIs.”\nFacebook also emphasised that the partnerships all required consent from users, generally through signing in to Facebook in the target app.\nAlex Stamos, a security researcher at Stanford university, and formerly Facebook’s chief information security officer, argued that some integrations of the kind revealed could be good for users, but that it was unclear which were or weren’t.\n“Allowing for 3rd party clients is the kind of pro-competition move we want to see from dominant platforms,” Stamos tweeted on Tuesday evening. “For ex, making Gmail only accessible to Android and the Gmail app would be horrible. For the NY Times to try to scandalize this kind of integration is wrong.\n“But integrations that are sneaky or send secret data to servers controlled by others really is wrong.”\nMost developers have to build Facebook integration through a standardised set of tools, limiting what they can do with user data, and providing an easier route for users to assess requests, approve or reject them, and periodically check which third-parties have access to their information.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": [\n\"Facebook shared private user messages with Netflix and Spotify.\",\n\"The social media giant granted major companies far more exceptions to its privacy policies than previously known.\",\n\"Facebook gave Netflix, Spotify, and the Royal Bank of Canada the ability to read, write, and delete users’ private messages.\",\n\"Facebook gave Microsoft, Sony, and Amazon the ability to obtain email addresses of their users’ friends.\",\n\"The arrangements bypassed Facebook’s typical privacy protections.\",\n\"The New York Times investigation revealed that it had itself been one of the companies granted access to some of the Facebook user data.\",\n\"Some of the reported loopholes were more or less transparent to the end user.\",\n\"Facebook appears to have granted companies far more access than they needed to build the user-focused features.\",\n\"Spotify, Netflix, and the Royal Bank of Canada were granted access to read, write, and delete private messages on the Facebook platform.\",\n\"Damian Collins, the chair of the UK’s DCMS committee, said the news shows that Facebook offers preferential access to user data to some of its major corporate partners.\",\n\"Collins’ parliamentary committee had previously revealed similar arrangements after obtaining internal Facebook emails that showed the company considering special access for partners.\",\n\"Facebook listed a number of ways that it said companies used the special access they were given.\",\n\"Facebook also emphasised that the partnerships all required consent from users, generally through signing in to Facebook in the target app.\"\n]\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2018\/dec\/19\/facebook-shared-user-data-private-messages-netflix-spotify-amazon-microsoft-sony","query_name":"updated_file_Third-party_Location_Data_Sharing.xlsx"}

And hackers – or malicious developers – could create personalised emails to send out to people to steal passwords (phishing) or install \"updates\" that were actually malware.\nApple does not pass on any such information from its App Store when users buy or download apps – although Google's store has a different legal structure from its rival's. Users buy from Apple, for legal purposes; with Google, they are legally buying from the developer.\nGoogle says it has to provide some location data about which country apps are bought in so developers can calculate the correct amount of tax to pay.\nBut that does not explain why it passes on buyers' names and email addresses, which together with a postcode could be used to identify a person's location and address.\n\"Google's prior privacy blunders have put [it] under higher scrutiny,\" Edelman says, pointing to the 20-year consent order with the US Federal Trade Commission that Google signed in March 2011 in the wake of its Buzz social network fiasco – followed by a record $22.5m fine in August 2012 for hacking Apple users' browsers to install tracking cookies. It has also been fiercely criticised in Europe for its changes in March 2012 to its privacy policies, which data protection chiefs said could mean \"uncontrolled\" use of personal data.\nEric Butler, a freelance software developer of the Tapchat and Farebot apps, tweeted in July 2012 \"I wonder if most Android users realise that when you buy an app in the Play Store the seller [of the app] can see your name, email address and phone.\"\nFollowing the row, he has noted on his blog that \"Because the entire experience of purchasing Android apps is so sloppy, it's not unreasonable to assume that this privacy issue was actually an oversight.\" But, he says, \"Google should follow Apple's lead and offer users and developers better privacy protection.\"\nThe release of the emails to developers was highlighted by Dan Moran, an Australian app developer, earlier in February – though Edelman points out that \"at least three other developers had previously raised the same concern\".\nAnother developer, Jesse Wilson, pointed out the same problem in November on Google+, and was quickly echoed by Chris Lacy, who said that \"as a developer I never asked for this information, I have no need for it, and I simply do not want to be a custodian of such information.\"\nLacy added that \"As a consumer, this is distressing on many levels: there is no fair warning that this information will be transferred … trusting my personal information to Google is one thing. But with this system, users are unknowingly having to trust their information to a third party. There's no way to know what security measures that third party might have in place.\" He added that it meant that the app developer \"has gained my personal information without requesting the appropriate permissions via the app.\"\nGoogle has said that passing on the details does not breach its privacy conditions. In a quote to Siliconvalley.com, a representative told the site that \"Google Wallet shares the information necessary to process a transaction, which is clearly spelled out in the Google Wallet privacy notice.\"\nBut Edelman disputes that. \"First, it simply is not 'necessary' to provide developers with access to customer names or email addresses in order to process customer transactions … To claim that it is 'necessary' to provide this information to developers, Google would need to establish that there is truly no alternative – a high bar, which Google has not even attempted to reach. Second, this data sharing is not 'spelled out in the Google Wallet privacy notice' and certainly is not 'clear' there.\"\nHe added that the idea that the developer is the \"merchant of record\" for the transaction is contradicted by the fact that the transaction is carried out with Google itself, through Google Wallet – and that repayments too come via Google. \"If it has 'Google' as the company you do the transaction with, not the developer, then it seems logical that Google is the merchant of record,\" he told the Guardian.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the analysis of the provided news in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"Is_relevant\": true,\n  \"Specific_information\": [\n    \"Google is facing privacy concerns regarding the release of personal details to app developers.\",\n    \"Names, geographic regions, and email addresses of Play Store app buyers are shared with app developers without explicit user consent.\",\n    \"Ben Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, highlights the lack of clauses in Google's terms and conditions notifying users about the sharing of their emails with developers.\",\n    \"There are concerns that developers could use this information to track and harass users who provide low ratings or request refunds.\",\n    \"Hackers or malicious developers could exploit this information for phishing attacks or malware distribution.\",\n    \"Apple's App Store does not share such personal information with developers.\",\n    \"Google argues that it shares some location data to calculate taxes, but this doesn't explain the sharing of names and email addresses.\",\n    \"The release of user emails to developers was brought to attention by app developer Dan Moran and other developers previously expressed concerns about this issue.\",\n    \"Google claims that sharing this information doesn't violate its privacy conditions, but Ben Edelman disputes this.\"\n  ]\n}\nThe news is relevant because it discusses privacy concerns related to the leakage of personal information (names, geographic regions, and email addresses) to app developers without users' explicit consent.

{"num":96,"Time":"7 minute read\nUpdated 9:11 AM EST, Tue March 9, 2021","Title":"‘Cookies’ track your every move online. Now there’s a fight over what should replace them","Content":"CNN\n — \nFor decades, “cookies” have been tracking you around the web. They’re the snippets of code that uniquely identify your browser and allow those shoe ads to follow you from site to site after you visit an online storefront. Soon, their time may be up.\nThird-party cookies have increasingly fallen by the wayside as the public has become more protective of privacy rights in an age of algorithms and data. Some major browsers including Firefox and Safari now block third-party cookies by default, further reducing their usefulness to advertisers. And Google has already said it’s planning to do the same in its browser, Chrome.\nBut last week Google (GOOGL) went further, announcing it will soon stop tracking individual people’s web browsing altogether for advertising purposes when Chrome finally drops third-party cookies.\nTargeting Big Tech, Maryland becomes first state to tax digital advertising\nIf that sounds like a big deal, that’s because it is. In a blog post explaining the change, Google said that once tracking cookies are eventually blocked by default on Chrome, the company won’t build or support browser technology designed to perpetuate individual-level data tracking. The announcement laid out Google’s intentions for what comes after the death of the third-party cookie, something it and many others in the industry had been anticipating for years.\nThe future of tracking-based web advertising, Google argued, will be more abstract, relying less on an individual’s browser history and more on what groups of internet users may be viewing at any given time.\nGiven Google’s enormous role in the advertising world and its control of the world’s most popular web browser, the company has the potential to determine how the next generation of ad technology works. But Google’s vision is not the only one. Sensing that change may soon be on the horizon, privacy advocates and others in the industry have put forth different ideas about how the future should unfold. At the same time, policymakers are erecting new regulations and questioning Google’s dominance in ways that could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to carry out its plan.\nA more anonymous way of tracking?\nTo understand what Google’s pitching, it helps to think about Facebook.\nFacebook also makes its money by serving ads. It doesn’t directly sell user information to advertisers; instead, it offers advertisers the opportunity to target ads to certain categories of Facebook users based on that data. Slicing and dicing people’s identities by their relationship status, the pages they’ve liked and even the content they click lets Facebook sell access to highly specific groups.\nThe system being developed by Google and others in standards-setting forums is based on the same principle, according to policy experts. Brands would be able to advertise to “cohorts” of internet users who share similar traits as defined by an algorithm. But unlike today, the marketers wouldn’t have access to specific data about individual members of the cohort.\nThe approach being championed by Google would theoretically give users more power than Facebook’s model. Rather than centralizing all user data under one roof, internet users’ web history would remain stored in their own browsers or on their own devices. Depending on which version of this idea is implemented — there are many — users could have settings that let them control what information their browser shares with the world. Ads for shoes and camping gear might still follow you around the internet this way, but advertisers would now be blasting those ads to you and thousands of others as a group, not as an individual.\nThat concept, which Google is currently testing, is designed to take the place of third-party tracking cookies, which can track you from site to site and develop a highly detailed picture of your browsing history for advertising purposes.\n“It fundamentally creeps people out,” said David Chavern, president and CEO of the News Media Alliance, a trade association representing news publishers. So if you’re a tech giant like Google whose business depends on user tracking, Chavern said, “you want to be ahead of these curves.”\nPrivacy advocates are wary\nGoogle says its vision of the future helps improve user privacy while still offering advertisers the same ability to target audiences.\n“Advertisers don’t need to track individual consumers across the web to get the performance benefits of digital advertising,” the company argued in its blog post. “Advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers.”\nSome privacy experts agree that the Google-backed proposal would be an improvement over the status quo — at least in theory.\n“For me, it’s a good step and a good signal, but I’d want to see the final package of solutions,” said Ashkan Soltani, an independent privacy and security researcher and a former chief technologist at the Federal Trade Commission.\nFacebook feuds with Apple over privacy changes that threaten its advertising business\nOne of the most important factors to watch, Soltani said, is how the user controls are designed. Do they offer a one-click mechanism for users to opt out of all data sharing? Can users pick and choose what types of data to share with advertisers? Are the controls easy for an average person to find and use?\nOthers are more skeptical, arguing that the proposal just trades one form of invasive monitoring for another.\n“Google, please don’t do this,” wrote the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, in a blog post. In the post, EFF technologist Bennett Cyphers argued that, depending on how small each cohort is and the ability for clever companies to cross-reference that data with other available information — such as your email address — it may well be possible for third parties to figure out who you are, anyway.\n“We should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads,” Cyphers wrote.\nWhat the ad industry wants\nSome in the advertising industry are working on an alternative to Google’s approach.\nA competing standard being developed under the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media — a group comprised of the Interactive Advertising Bureau Tech Lab, many ad-tech companies, Unilever, Ford, IBM and others — would replace cookie-based tracking with tracking that’s tied to individual email addresses. Whenever you log into a participating site with your email address, that address would then be used to keep tabs on you as you navigate to other participating sites. The email addresses would be scrambled, so in theory internet users would remain anonymous to advertisers while still being trackable for advertising on an individualized basis.\n“The Google announcement has not changed our plans to provide a new portfolio of approaches to addressability, with privacy and with auditable accountability,” said Bill Tucker, the executive director of PRAM, in a statement responding to Google’s blog post.\nWithout naming PRAM, Google has called the email-based approach impractical.\n“We don’t believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy,” it said in its blog post, “nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment.”\nPrivacy and policy experts have also criticized the email-based approach. As with other forms of purportedly “anonymized” data, they said, it’s trivial to reverse-engineer a person’s identity by combining scrambled information with other publicly available data.\nIn some ways, they added, using scrambled email addresses is even worse from a privacy perspective than using cookies, which can at least be easily cleared from a browser.\n“I have the same personal email address from the late ’90s,” said Jason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group representing digital publishers. “It’s nearly impossible to purge. So it’s a fallacy that some hashed email is going to be more private than a cookie.”\nGoogle’s new solution could make it more powerful\nEven though it’s moving away from the third-party cookie, that doesn’t mean Google has become consumers’ knight in shining armor. As the company faces multiple antitrust lawsuits by state and federal officials over its dominance of search and advertising, the Google-backed tracking proposal is being scrutinized for the way it could further entrench the company.\nWhat the Biden administration means for the future of Silicon Valley\nEven if Google’s proposed standard takes off, the company could seek to maintain its own access to the data that’s become inaccessible to websites and advertisers, privacy critics worry, because Google makes smartphones, the Android operating system and the Chrome browser. Android phones account for over 70% of the global smartphone market and Chrome captures 66% of the market for browsers, according to Statcounter.\n“Google’s the biggest tracker of any company on the internet,” said Kint. “They’re competing in the same marketplace where they’re designing the rules.”\nGoogle’s control over major technology products and its ability to crunch data at scale give it immense advantages — and an incentive to abuse them, Soltani agreed. If Google moves to keep a home-court advantage of sorts, that could bolster the outcry from Google’s antitrust critics, he added.\nStill, he said, “what the defaults are, what the controls are, I think, will ultimately dictate how actually sincere Google’s push is.”\nGoogle told CNN Business that under its proposal, the advertising giant would not enjoy any special access to browsing data. Google will only be able to see the same aggregated information as the rest of the market, the company said. But the company did not rule out matching browsing cohorts with the enormous amounts of data that Google collects on the individual users of its many products and services.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is about problems related to privacy and online tracking.

Google is the company behind Android. The two operating systems power the vast majority of smartphones in use.\nSome countries - including Singapore, Israel, South Korea and Poland - are already using people's handsets to issue coronavirus contagion alerts.\nOther health authorities - including the UK, France and Germany - are working on initiatives of their own. And some municipal governments in the US are reportedly about to adopt a third-party app.\nThe two technology giants aim to bring coherence to all this by allowing existing third-party apps to be retrofitted to include their solution.\nThis would make the apps interoperable, so contact tracing would continue to work as people travelled overseas and came into contact with people using a different tool.\nApple and Google have been working on the effort for about two weeks but have not externally revealed their plans until Friday.\nIf successful, the scheme could help countries relax lockdowns and border restrictions.\nPhone-based matches\nThe companies aim to release a software building-block - known as an API (application programming interface) - by mid-May.\nThis would allow others' apps to run on the same basis.\nRecords of the digital IDs involved would be stored on remote computer servers but the companies say these could not be used to unmask a specific individual's true identity.\nFurthermore, the contact-matching process would take place on the phones rather than centrally.\nThis would make it possible for someone to be told they should go into quarantine, without anyone else being notified.\nA SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?\nLOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your area\nMAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreak\nSTRESS: How to look after your mental health\nThe two companies have released details of the cryptography specifications they plan to use to safeguard privacy, and details of the role Bluetooth will play.\nThey hope this will convince activists their approach can be trusted.\nApple and Google say another benefit of their solution is developers would not risk the iOS and Android versions of their apps becoming incompatible because of a buggy update.\nIn addition, they believe it would be less taxing on battery life than current contact-tracing systems.\nNo app needed\nPhase two of the initiative involves building contact-tracing capabilities into the iOS and Android operating systems. Users could then switch the capability on and off again without having to download an app at all.\nApproved third-party apps would still be able to interact with the facility if desired.\nThe facility would be delivered via a future system software update. But the companies have yet to say when this would occur.\n\"This is a more robust solution,\" they say, suggesting there would be wider adoption if users did not have to download additional software for themselves.\nIt also provides the companies with the ability to easily disable tracing on a regional basis when the pandemic ends.\nWhile Apple and Google hope others will see benefits of adopting their approach, this is not guaranteed.\nAn independent effort - the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) initiative - revealed its own attempt to deliver a privacy-centric solution on 1 April.\nAbout 130 technologists and scientists are involved and the group has already made contact with several European governments.\nMore on this story\nMoscow coronavirus app raises privacy concerns\nPublished\n1 April 2020\nUK considers virus-tracing app to ease lockdown\nPublished\n31 March 2020\nUK coronavirus app 'must respect privacy rights'\nPublished\n23 March 2020","Relevant":true,"Overview":"Here is the JSON format analysis of the news:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n    \"Is_relevant\": true,\n    \"Specific_information\": \"Apple and Google are jointly developing technology to alert people if they have recently come into contact with others found to be infected with coronavirus.

Changes include making it easier for European users to report illegal content, turning off personalised recommendations for videos and the removal of targeted advertising for users aged 3-17.\nTheo Bertram, TikTok’s vice-president of public policy for Europe, said implementing data sovereignty was a “really significant area of investment in our company” and the platform had made “substantial progress” on Project Clover.\nHe added: “What we heard from the commission is that they are taking action about a fear of things that can happen instead of things that have happened and it is not enough for us to say: ‘Trust us are keeping data secure’ – which is why we have brought in NCC group so there is confidence in what we are saying and it being validated by an independent third party company.”\nElaine Fox, the platform’s head of privacy for Europe, said that when Project Clover is fully operational “personal data of EEA\/UK users will go through additional security gateways before it can be accessed”.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\n“I have serious doubts about whether those rights are being respected in law or in practice,” Democratic Senator Al Franken said at a hearing of a new subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law.\nSenators accused the tech industry of exploiting location data for marketing purposes -- a potentially multibillion-dollar industry -- without getting proper consent from millions of Americans.\nLawmakers did, however, say they would be cautious about drafting privacy rules that could stifle innovation in the space. Mobile device users’ personal information helps companies tailor coupons, advertisements and weather information, among many other things.\n“Don’t get me wrong.

The bills include proposals that companies tell consumers what data is being collected, with whom it is shared and how it is safeguarded.\nIt is too early to tell which, if any, of the bills might become law.\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, said he is frustrated that no company is willing to take responsibility for ensuring the safety of customer data -- citing specifically Google’s preference for openness, and Internet service providers “crawling with malware.”\n“I think we really need to be working on those boundaries. ‘As open as possible’ is not an adequate standard to this task,” he said.\nWhitehouse noted that some apps are given away or are sold for very little precisely because app developers plan to collect and sell personal information gathered on their users.\n“We need to consider a bit more what our model is going to be here.

{"num":98,"Time":"Sat 24 Mar 2018 10.00 CET","Title":"‘A grand illusion’: seven days that shattered Facebook’s facade","Content":"“Dumb fucks.” That’s how Mark Zuckerberg described users of Facebook for trusting him with their personal data back in 2004. If the last week is anything to go by, he was right.\nSince the Observer reported that the personal data of about 50 million Americans had been harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, it has become increasingly apparent that the social network has been far more lax with its data sharing practices than many users realised.\nAs the scandal unfurled over the last seven days, Facebook’s lackluster response has highlighted a fundamental challenge for the company: how can it condemn the practice on which its business model depends?\n“This is the story we have been waiting for so people will pay attention not just to Facebook but the entire surveillance economy,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.\nThey may now regret it but they knowingly unleashed the forces that have led to this lack of trust and loss of privacy\nSince Zuckerberg’s “dumb fucks” comment, Facebook has gone to great lengths to convince members of the public that it’s all about “connecting people” and “building a global community”. This pseudo-uplifting marketing speak is much easier for employees and users to stomach than the mission of “guzzling personal data so we can micro-target you with advertising”.\nIn the wake of the revelations that Cambridge Analytica misappropriated data collected by Dr Aleksandr Kogan under the guise of academic research, Facebook has scrambled to blame these rogue third parties for “platform abuse”. “The entire company is outraged we were deceived,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.\nHowever, in highlighting the apparent deceit, the company has been forced to shine a light on its underlying business model and years of careless data sharing practices.\nSure, the data changed hands between the researcher and Cambridge Analytica in apparent violation of Kogan’s agreement with Facebook, but everything else was above board. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica got hold of and used to deliver targeted advertising based on personality types – including activities, interests, check-ins, location, photos, religion, politics, relationship details – was not unusual in the slightest. This was a feature, not a bug.\n00:13:04\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video\n‘Extremely friendly to app developers’\nThere are thousands of other developers, including the makers of the dating app Tinder, games such as FarmVille, as well as consultants to Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, who slurped huge quantities of data about users and their friends – all thanks to Facebook’s overly permissive “Graph API”, the interface through which third parties could interact with Facebook’s platform.\nFacebook opened up in order to attract app developers to join Facebook’s ecosystem at a time when the company was playing catch-up in shifting its business from desktops to smartphones. It was a symbiotic relationship that was critical to Facebook’s growth.\n“They wanted to push as much of the conversation, ad revenue and digital activity as possible and made it extremely friendly to app developers,” said Jeff Hauser, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Now they are complaining that the developers abused them. They wanted that. They were encouraging it. They may now regret it but they knowingly unleashed the forces that have led to this lack of trust and loss of privacy.”\n'Utterly horrifying': ex-Facebook insider says covert data harvesting was routine\nRead more\nThe terms were updated in April 2014 to restrict the data new developers could get hold of, including people’s friends’ data, but only after four years of access to the Facebook firehose. Companies that plugged in before April 2014 had another year before access was restricted.\n“There are all sorts of companies that are in possession of terabytes of information from before 2015,” said Hauser. “Facebook’s practices don’t bear up to close, informed scrutiny nearly as well as they look from the 30,000ft view, which is how people had been viewing Facebook previously.”\nCambridge Analytica claims it helped get Trump elected by using data to target voters on Facebook. Photograph: Win Mcnamee\/AFP\/Getty Images\nFor too long consumers have thought about privacy on Facebook in terms of whether their ex-boyfriends or bosses could see their photos. However, as we fiddle around with our profile privacy settings, the real intrusions have been taking place elsewhere.\n“In this sense, Facebook’s ‘privacy settings’ are a grand illusion. Control over post-sharing – people we share to – should really be called ‘publicity settings’,” explains Jonathan Albright, the research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “Likewise, control over passive sharing – the information people [including third party apps] can take from us – should be called ‘privacy settings’.”\nEssentially Facebook gives us privacy “busywork” to make us think we have control, while making it very difficult to truly lock down our accounts.\n‘The biggest issue I’ve ever seen’\nFacebook is dealing with a PR minefield. The more it talks about its advertising practices, the more the #DeleteFacebook movement grows. Even the co-founder of WhatsApp Brian Acton, who profited from Facebook’s $19bn acquisition of his app, this week said he was deleting his account.\n“This is the biggest issue I’ve ever seen any technology company face in my time,” said Roger McNamee, Zuckerberg’s former mentor.\n“It’s not like tech hasn’t had a lot of scandals,” he said, mentioning the Theranos fraud case and MiniScribe packing actual bricks into boxes instead of hard drives. “But no one else has played a role in undermining democracy or the persecution of minorities before.

It asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and revoked Kogan’s apps’ API access. However, Facebook relied on Cambridge Analytica’s word that they had done so.\nLeft unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency\nWhen the Observer contacted Facebook last week with testimony from a whistleblower stating that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted the data, Facebook’s reaction was to try to get ahead of the story by publishing its own disclosure late on Friday and sending a legal warning to try to prevent publication of its bombshell discoveries.\nThen followed five days of virtual silence from the company, as the chorus of calls from critics grew louder, and further details of Facebook’s business dealings emerged.\nA second whistleblower, the former Facebook manager Sandy Parakilas, revealed that he found Facebook’s lack of control over the data given to outside developers “utterly horrifying”. He told the Guardian that he had warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach, but that he was discouraged from investigating further.\nAt around the same time, it emerged that the co-director of the company that harvested the Facebook data before passing it to Cambridge Analytic is a current employee at Facebook.

{"num":103,"Time":"Fri 17 Mar 2023 01.19 CET","Title":"The TikTok wars – why the US and China are feuding over the app","Content":"TikTok is once again fending off claims that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would share user data from its popular video-sharing app with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf.\nChina’s foreign ministry on Wednesday accused the US itself of spreading disinformation about TikTok’s potential security risks following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the committee on foreign investment in the US – part of the treasury department – was threatening a US ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stake.\nWill UK follow US in demanding TikTok be sold by its Chinese owner?\nRead more\nSo are the data security risks real? And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones?\nHere’s what to know:\nWhat are the concerns about TikTok?\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data – such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers – with China’s authoritarian government.\nA law implemented by China in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the country’s national security. There’s no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it, like other social media companies, collects.\nConcerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists from BuzzFeed News and the Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company. Just last week, the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, told the Senate intelligence committee that TikTok “screams” of national security concerns and that China could also manipulate the algorithm to spread misinformation.\n“This is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government, and to me, it screams out with national security concerns,” Wray said.\nHow is the US responding?\nThe White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, declined to comment when asked on Thursday to address the Chinese foreign ministry’s comments about TikTok, citing the review being conducted by the committee on foreign investment.\nKirby also could not confirm that the administration sent TikTok a letter warning that the US government may ban the application if its Chinese owners don’t sell its stake but added, “we have legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity that we need to observe.”\nIn 2020, then president Donald Trump and his administration sought to force ByteDance to sell off its US assets and ban TikTok from app stores. Courts blocked the effort, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders but directed an in-depth study of the issue. A planned sale of TikTok’s US assets was also shelved as the Biden administration negotiated a deal with the app that would address some of the national security concerns.\nIn Congress, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Jerry Moran, a Democrat and a Republican, respectively, wrote a letter in February to the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, urging the committee on foreign investment panel, which she chairs, to “swiftly conclude its investigation and impose strict structural restrictions” between TikTok’s US operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies.\nAt the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration’s authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support.\nHow has TikTok already been restricted?\nOn Thursday, British authorities said they were banning TikTok on government-issued phones on security grounds, after similar moves by the EU’s executive branch, which temporarily banned TikTok from employee phones. Denmark and Canada have also announced efforts to block the app on government-issued phones.\nLast month, the White House said it would give US federal agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the US armed forces and more than half of US states had already banned the app on official devices.\nWhat does TikTok say?\nA TikTok spokesperson, Maureen Shanahan, said the company was already answering security concerns through “transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification”.\nIn June, TikTok said it would route all data from US users to servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it chose as its US tech partner in 2020 in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban. But it is storing backups of the data in its own servers in the US and Singapore. The company said it expects to delete US user data from its own servers, but it has not provided a timeline as to when that would occur.\nThe TikTok CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is will testify next week before the House energy and commerce committee about the company’s privacy and data-security practices, as well as its relationship with the Chinese government. In the lead-up to the hearing, Chew has quietly met with several lawmakers – some of whom remain unmoved by their conversation with the 40-year-old executive.\nAfter convening with Chew in February, Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado who previously called on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, said he remained “fundamentally concerned that TikTok, as a Chinese-owned company, is subject to dictates from the Chinese Communist party”.\nMeanwhile, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, has been trying to position itself as more of an international company – and less of a Chinese company that was founded in Beijing in 2012 by its current chief executive, Liang Rubo, and others.\nTheo Bertram, TikTok’s vice-president of policy in Europe, said in a tweet on Thursday that ByteDance “is not a Chinese company”. Bertram said its ownership consists of 60% global investors, 20% employees and 20% founders. Its leaders are based in cities such as Singapore, New York, Beijing and other metropolitan areas.\nAre the security risks legitimate?\nIt depends on whom you ask.\nSome tech privacy advocates say that while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information.\n“If policymakers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,” said Evan Greer, director of the non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future.\nKarim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be “completely irrelevant to any of the alleged ‘national security’ threats” and go against “every free market principle and norm” of the state department’s internet freedom principles.\nOthers say there is legitimate reason for concern.\nPeople who use TikTok might think they’re not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but that’s not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the US is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said.\nIs there precedent for banning tech companies?\nLast year, the US banned the sale of communications equipment made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing risks to national security. But banning the sale of items could be more easily done than banning an app, which is accessed through the web.\nSuch a move might also go to the courts on grounds that it could violate the first amendment as some civil liberties groups have argued.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news discusses concerns about TikTok's potential data security risks, including the sharing of user data with the Chinese government, location information, and biometric identifiers.

The council said the app had such a “vague” privacy policy that it was probably in breach of GDPR, particularly concerning how the company tried to excuse itself from misuse of data by advertising partners.\nGrindr told users that they needed to check with partners to find out how their data was used, but only named one such partner, MoPub, an ad network owned by Twitter. MoPub, in turn, lists more than 160 partners to which data may be passed.\n“By stating that it does ‘not control the use of these tracking technologies’, and by asking users to read the privacy policies of any third-party companies that may receive personal data, Grindr is attempting to shift accountability for the advertising technologies that it is using away from itself,” the report concluded.\nMax Schrems, founder of the European privacy non-profit organisation Noyb, told the NCC: “Every time you open an app like Grindr, advertisement networks get your GPS location, device identifiers and even the fact that you use a gay dating app. This is an insane violation of users’ EU privacy rights.”\nFollowing the publication of the report, the council filed formal complaints of GDPR breaches against Grindr and MoPub, as well as four other ad tech firms.\nTwitter said it would investigate the allegations saying Grindr provided data with inadequate consent, and suspended the app from MoPub. “We are currently investigating this issue to understand the sufficiency of Grindr’s consent mechanism,” Twitter said. “In the meantime, we have disabled Grindr’s MoPub account.”\nEvery app assessed had some privacy problems, however, leading the report’s authors to conclude that the problem was endemic. “Because of the scope of tests, size of the third parties that were observed receiving data and popularity of the apps, we regard the findings from these tests to be representative of widespread practices.”\nThe tests, which were carried out on Android devices, showed that every single app shared data with third parties. Eight of the 10 also shared data with Google’s ad service, while nine of them shared data with Facebook.\n“We urge data protection authorities to enforce the GDPR,” the NCC concluded, “and for advertisers and publishers to look toward alternative digital advertising methods that respect fundamental rights.”\nFinn Myrstad, the NCC’s digital policy director, told the New York Times, which first reported the study: “Any consumer with an average number of apps on their phone – anywhere between 40 and 80 apps – will have their data shared with hundreds or perhaps thousands of actors online.”\nA Grindr spokesperson said: “User privacy and data security is, and always will be, a high priority for Grindr. Examples of this commitment include sharing our revised privacy policy in its entirety to every Grindr user in order to gain their consent and provide even greater transparency about Grindr’s privacy-forward practices.\n“In addition, Grindr is currently implementing an enhanced consent management platform with OneTrust to provide users with additional in-app control regarding their personal data. As always, Grindr users have individual control over exactly what information they choose to provide in their profiles. We have also further enhanced our information security policy as part of our ongoing commitment to safeguard our users’data.\n“So while we reject a number of the report’s assumptions and conclusions, we welcome the opportunity to be a small part in a larger conversation about how we can collectively evolve the practices of mobile publishers and continue to provide users with access to an option of a free platform.

{"num":105,"Time":"Sun 5 Feb 2023 10.00 CET","Title":"TikTok: how the west has turned on gen Z’s favourite app","Content":"T\nhe FBI has called it a national security threat. The US government has passed a law forcing officials to delete it from their phones. Texas senator Ted Cruz has denounced it as “a Trojan horse the Chinese Communist party can use to influence what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think”. And in March its CEO will defend its existence before the US Congress. For those unaware of the debate broiling on the other side of the Atlantic, the target of this strong rhetoric might prove surprising: an app best known for viral dances, launching generation Z media stars, and sucking teens down an hours-long content abyss.\nBut the rancorous debate over TikTok that began under the Trump administration has rolled on under President Biden. In addition to a ban of the app on all federal government devices, at least 27 states have blocked TikTok on devices they’ve issued, affecting a number of state schools and universities, too. A bipartisan bill, introduced in Congress last December, stipulates banning the app’s use by everyone in the United States.\nTikTok scepticism is spreading to Europe too. Some politicians – echoing their Washington-based counterparts – contend that TikTok poses a security risk, warning it could potentially hand user data to Chinese authorities, and\/or be wielded as a propaganda tool for the Chinese government – subtly influencing TikTok’s more than 1 billion monthly active users in a direction that dovetails with Chinese foreign policy goals.\nIt’s emblematic of ratcheting Sino-western tensions, where tussling over technology is as much about genuine paranoia over espionage as it is a useful arena for geopolitical grandstanding. In the age of the “splinternet” – which has seen the once-open web fracturing across different jurisdictions – anxieties over data sovereignty and information flows are on the rise. How western governments respond to TikTok could mark a decisive step in how technology is regulated in the decades to come.\nNext month, TikTok’s CEO Shou Zi Chew will be answering US lawmakers’ questions about privacy, data and Chinese influence on the platform. Photograph: Bloomberg\/Getty Images\nWhile accusations that TikTok hands over user data to the Chinese government are so far unsubstantiated, the app’s claims over its trustworthiness took a blow in December with the revelation that employees at ByteDance (TikTok’s parent company) accessed TikTok data in an attempt to track the whereabouts of several western journalists in order to discover their sources within the company.\nTikTok says the incident involved improper data access and that the employees responsible have been fired, but the transgression has nevertheless served as a lightning rod for apprehensions surrounding the company and the app’s data privacy protocols.\nAlicia Kearns MP, the Conservative chair of both the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and of the China Research Group, has previously called upon TikTok to provide testimony about the data privacy of UK users. “In their evidence, they said something like ‘This could never happen’,” says Kearns. “Well, obviously that is not true, and it has happened.” (Last October, ByteDance tweeted that “TikTok has never been used to ‘target’ any members of the US government, activists, public figures or journalists.”)\nTikTok met European commissioners last month to discuss data privacy and content moderation, in the context of how the company plans to comply with the EU’s new digital services regulation. “They’re starting to realise that TikTok is not just another app to communicate, or send videos to one another, or for amusement,” says Belgian MEP Tom Vandendriessche. “TikTok is gathering the data of our citizens.”\nIt’s worth noting TikTok is not the only company that has engaged in this practice: American businesses, including Microsoft and Uber, have also been found guilty of tracking individual users through their products in the past. But in the US, the news arrived at a highly sensitive time for the company. “This should be the final nail in the coffin for the idea that the US can trust TikTok,” tweeted Brendan Carr, a member of the US Federal Communications Commission.\nT\nhe conversation in Europe is a little different. So far, the bloc has been less willing to single out TikTok on the basis of the location of its parent company. It is scrutinising the app over data privacy concerns: Ireland’s data protection commissioner opened two probes into the company in 2021 – one focusing on its handling of children’s data, the other to check that its data transfers to China complied with EU data legislation. (A draft decision has been submitted on the first inquiry.)\nHowever, this is not unique to TikTok. The likes of Facebook and Google have also become ensnared in Europe’s data privacy laws, and the EU is currently wrangling with the US over whether EU data should be allowed to be sent there, for fears it could be hoovered up by US intelligence agencies.\nTikTok has more than 1 billion monthly active users and it beats other social apps on engagement time – users spend an average of 95 minutes a day scrolling. Photograph: Robin Utrecht\/REX\/Shutterstock\n“While some questions about TikTok and our Chinese heritage have become politicised, we take national security concerns very seriously,” says Theo Bertram, vice-president of public policy and government relations, Europe at TikTok.\nRegardless of where you are, how seriously should you take the warnings? Some technology experts say the accusations are somewhat overblown. Both the data privacy and content manipulation threats cited by politicians currently lack convincing evidence, says Graham Webster, research scholar and editor in chief of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center in California.\nThere are lots of ways that foreign governments can access data in the US. TikTok seems to be an unlikely target\nAnupam Chander, Georgetown University Law Center\n“I think both of these theories are possible, but at this point they both require a significant amount of imagination to actually constitute a US national security threat,” says Webster. He doesn’t think it’s unreasonable at this stage to think that Chinese officials might have unauthorised access to TikTok user data. “But you would have to make an argument for why that access can be used in such a way that constitutes a national security threat,” he says.\nThis is because the data held by TikTok isn’t unique. The app can collect location data, but must ask users before tracking detailed GPS data. If the user declines, only their rough whereabouts can be gathered. (In fact, a TikTok spokesperson claims its employees didn’t succeed in the attempted tracking of journalists precisely for this reason.) What’s more, the same data is gathered by any number of apps – and is routinely sold on to third-party data brokers who make it available to prospective buyers.\n“There are lots of ways that foreign governments can access data in the United States,” says Anupam Chander, professor of law and technology at Georgetown University Law Center, Washington DC. “TikTok seems to be an unlikely target of data gathering by the Chinese government, because of the largely public nature of the activity on the app.”\nD\nata privacy issues aside, what about the “Trojan horse” argument advanced by the likes of Cruz? Is TikTok secretly inculcating in generation Z a taste for Chinese Communist party talking points? In 2019 the Guardian revealed that the app’s content guidelines for moderators on how to deal with inflammatory content yielded the serendipitous by-product of stifling any mention of Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or Falun Gong – all topics that are suppressed by Beijing. At the time, the company insisted the documents didn’t reflect its current policy and that it had since embraced a localised content moderation strategy tailored to each region.\nUS Senator Ted Cruz has claimed that TikTok is a ‘Trojan horse’ that the Chinese state can use to affect what Americans think. Photograph: Rebecca Noble\/Reuters\nA 2021\/22 study by Nato’s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence found that TikTok compared favourably to other platforms on combating inauthentic manipulation (coming second to Twitter, and ahead of Facebook, Instagram and YouTube). The report recommended more cooperation with external researchers to make it easier to study content moderation on the platform, something a TikTok spokesperson says the app is aiming to grow.\nAlthough TikTok has repeatedly said that western user data is not stored in China, that it has never, and would never, share user data with Chinese officials, and that its global content moderation strategy is not beholden to Beijing, over the past six years, TikTok and Washington’s committee on foreign investment in the United States (CFIUS) have been negotiating a deal aimed at finally allaying the concerns of US politicians.\nTo address fears about content manipulation that serves Beijing, Oracle will inspect TikTok’s content algorithms\nThe $1.5bn Project Texas involves the establishment of a data centre that will store US user data in Texas, under the watchful eye of Oracle, the American software giant headed up by billionaire GOP funder and Trump ally Larry Ellison. To address fears about content manipulation that serves the Chinese government, Oracle will also inspect the app’s source code and content algorithms.\nTikTok is now making similar arrangements for Europe. The company is setting up a data centre in Ireland that will store the data of users in the UK and EU.\nThese measures would place the app’s data practices under far more scrutiny than its Silicon Valley competitors, according to Webster. “Based on the reporting of what [Project Texas] would look like,” he says, “it sounds like they’re talking about measures that should basically mitigate these potential security threats – as much as is reasonable, in my opinion.” Whether it will be enough to satisfy regulators is another issue.\nOne party eyeing the negotiations with interest is Facebook, which views TikTok as an existential threat. Last year, the Washington Post revealed a Facebook-backed lobbying campaign targeting TikTok that specifically played on data privacy fears. This could prove money well spent, given that TikTok users say in the event of the app being banned they would probably pivot to (the Facebook-owned) Instagram or other social media apps.\nMore bans raise the prospect of legal challenges on the basis of freedom of speech or expression. The obvious parallels between banning apps and the Chinese government’s strict internet controls have been widely noted – a phenomenon that’s particularly ironic for Republicans, who have spent the past few years pounding the drum for supposed freedom of speech.\nBut there is agreement on one thing – that this should serve as a catalyst for the US to finally start thinking about data privacy more generally. “The idea of foreign ownership as being the critical basis for intervention [on TikTok] seems unwise,” says Chander. “We should have a broader approach that examines the national security risks posed by data flows more generally.”\nHe’s not alone in hoping the TikTok debate might spur progress on the establishment of national data privacy legislation that would protect American consumers on all apps, not just TikTok.","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage due to concerns regarding TikTok's data privacy and potential influence by the Chinese government.

It is facing around 28 actions against the mapping service, 11 from inside the US.\nAlthough the information commissioner last week lifted some of the heat on Google's suspected breach of the Data Protection Act in the UK, the search giant still faces lawsuits or criminal investigations in every continent except the Antarctic. Its products have been the subject of bans or threatened bans in at least 23 countries, and Google faces 33 lawsuits in the US alone, according to new estimates by the analysts Aqute Intelligence.\nStreet View, which shows 360-degree views of towns and cities, kept Google's lawyers particularly busy in the first half of this year. In May, Google admitted that its Street View cars had picked up approximately 600 gigabytes of personal data from Wi-Fi connections while mapping homes in more than 30 nations. Cue litigations from internet service providers, private companies and aggrieved citizens.\nSome of those aggrieved object to pictures of their home being made public, while others take umbrage over Google's apparently inadvertent collection of personal data. All actions boil down to an individual's right to privacy – and what information requires prior consent before being made publicly accessible. Of the 60 litigations faced by Google worldwide, 28 pertain to Street View: 11 in the US, 14 in Europe, two in Australasia and one in Asia. And Google's YouTube has been banned or threatened with a ban in 19 countries. A regional court in Russia last week became the latest authority to block access to it – a single hosted video was deemed \"extremist\" and a regional ban on the website was ordered. Google, in response, said the ruling violated the country's constitutional right to freedom of information. The internet rights group, Internet Technologies Association, recently launched a legal protest against a two-year-old ban on the website in Turkey, citing fundamental freedom of expression. Proxy servers used to circumvent the government ban keep YouTube a regular fixture in Turkey's top 10 most-visited websites.\nA map from which these figures come was put together by Aqute Intelligence. Since going live in early July, the map has had more than 62,000 views – a significant proportion of those are likely to be from privacy advocates, lawyers and pressure groups. James MacAonghus, the research director at Aqute, says: \"The point we're trying to make is that as Google gets more powerful, it's coming up against more legislation and they've got loads of balls to juggle at the same time.

{"num":7,"Time":"Wed 11 May 2011 13.00 CEST","Title":"Police buy software to map suspects' digital movements","Content":"Britain's largest police force is using software that can map nearly every move suspects and their associates make in the digital world, prompting an outcry from civil liberties groups.\nThe Metropolitan police has bought Geotime, a security programme used by the US military, which shows an individual's movements and communications with other people on a three-dimensional graphic. It can be used to collate information gathered from social networking sites, satellite navigation equipment, mobile phones, financial transactions and IP network logs.\nPolice have confirmed its purchase and declined to rule out its use in investigating public order disturbances.\nCampaigners and lawyers have expressed concern at how the software could be used to monitor innocent parties such as protesters in breach of data protection legislation.\nAlex Hanff, the campaigns manager at Privacy International, called on the police to explain who will decide how this software will be used in future.\n\"Once millions and millions of pieces of microdata are aggregated, you end up with this very high-resolution picture of somebody, and this is effectively what they are doing here.\n\"We shouldn't be tracked and traced and have pictures built by our own government and police for the benefit of commercial gain,\" he said.\nSarah McSherry, a partner at Christian Khan Solicitors, which represents several protesters in cases against the Metropolitan police, said: \"We have already seen the utilisation of a number of tactics which infringe the right to peaceful protest, privacy and freedom of expression, assembly and movement. All of these have a chilling effect on participation in peaceful protest. This latest tool could also be used in a wholly invasive way and could fly in the face of the role of the police to facilitate rather than impede the activities of democratic protesters.\"\nHugh Tomlinson QC, a specialist in privacy, said a public body such as the police must be able to justify the lawfulness of how it uses the information it collects and retains.\n\"Storing data because it's potentially interesting or potentially useful is not good enough. There has got to be some specific justification,\" he said.\nAccording to Geotime's website, the programme displays data from a variety of sources, allowing the user to navigate the data with a timeline and animated display. The website claims it can also throw up previously unseen connections between individuals.\n\"Links between entities can represent communications, relationships, transactions, message logs, etc and are visualised over time to reveal temporal patterns and behaviours,\" it reads.\nThe software was displayed in Britain earlier this month at the defence industry Counter Terror exhibition in Olympia, west London. Curtis Garton, product management director for Oculus, the company that markets the programme, said the Metropolitan police was the only UK police force to have purchased the software. \"[There are] a few countries that we don't sell to, but in terms of commercial sales pretty much anybody can buy,\" he said.\nThe issue of data retention and how it is used has become a major political and judicial issue. The European justice commissioner, Viviane Reding, said in March that data protection rules also applied to data retention. \"Individuals must be informed about which data is collected and for what purposes,\" she said. \"To be effective, data protection rights need to actually be enforced.\"\nThe Guardian disclosed last week that an 86-year-old man had been granted permission to take legal action against police chiefs who kept a detailed record of his political activities on a clandestine database.\nJohn Catt, who has no criminal record, is bringing the high court action against a secretive police unit that systematically logged his presence at more than 55 peace and human rights protests over a four-year period.\nSome academics have praised the software as a positive move for the police in their fight against terrorist groups and organised crime.\nProfessor Anthony Glees, director of the University of Buckingham's Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, said he was aware of tracking software such as Geotime, the use of which he described as \"absolutely right\".\n\"There are these dangerous people out there and we need to stay ahead of the game in order to deal with the threat that they pose,\" he said. \"My feeling is: if it can be done, and if its purpose is the protection of the ordinary citizen that wants to go about their lawful business ... then it's absolutely fine.\"\nA spokesman for the Met confirmed that Geotime had been paid for, and said several possible uses for it were being assessed, including as a tool in \"telephone investigations\".\nHe declined to clarify what a telephone investigation might be or how much the software cost. Neither could he comment on whether the software might be used during investigations into public order offences in the future.\n\"We are in the process of evaluating the Geotime software to explore how it could possibly be used to assist us in understanding patterns in data relating to both space and time. A decision has yet to be made as to whether we will adopt the technology [permanently]. We have used dummy data to look at how the software works and have explored how we could use it to examine police vehicle movements, crime patterns and telephone investigations,\" he wrote in an email.\nAlongside the Met, the Ministry of Defence is also examining Geotime. A spokesman said: \"The MoD is assessing Geotime as part of its research programme but it is not currently being used on operations.\"","Relevant":true,"Overview":"{\n\"Is_relevant\": true,\n\"Specific_information\": \"The news is relevant to problems about privacy leakage and location information leakage because it discusses the Metropolitan police purchasing Geotime, a security program used by the US military, which can map an individual's movements and communications with others in the digital world. This software can collect data from various sources, including social networking sites, satellite navigation equipment, mobile phones, financial transactions, and IP network logs. It also mentions concerns raised by civil liberties groups, campaigners, and lawyers about the potential misuse of this technology to monitor innocent parties, such as protesters, and its implications for data protection and privacy.\"\n}","From":"theguardian.com","Url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk\/2011\/may\/11\/police-software-maps-digital-movements","query_name":"updated_file_Use_of_Digital_Map_Data_in_Legal_Proceedings.xlsx"}
